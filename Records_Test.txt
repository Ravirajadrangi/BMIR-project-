She has twochildren. She is a former cigarette smoker. She does not usealcohol.FAMILY HISTORY:The patient has a positive family history of coronary disease ,hypertension and diabetes.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM/ PROBLEM:Persistent pulmonary1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure. On 1/7/06 , shortly afterher admission to the medical floor , the patient was noted to bein respiratory distress with tachypnea , accessory muscle use andoxygen saturation of 68% on 6 liters nasal cannula. She wasplaced on a nonrebreather. Her oxygen saturation increased to93%; however , she continued to be in respiratory distress withtachypnea and accessory muscle use. She was intubated andtransferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for furtherevaluation and management. Her respiratory failure was thoughtto be secondary to pneumonia with a component of superimposedvolume overload. She was treated with a 10-day course ofvancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime as well as with IVLasix. She underwent a code green on 7/30/06 during an ETT tubechange , wherein a patent airway was transiently loss. Thepatient was slow to wean from the ventilator. Her chest imagingrevealed persistent bilateral opacifications. It was thoughtthat after an initial infectious insult , the patient developedARDS. On 9/14/06 , the patient underwent bronchoscopy and BALrevealing MRSA and HSV. The patient was treated with a 10-daycourse of acyclovir for presumed HSV tracheobronchitis. Givenher inability to be weaned from the vent , the patient underwent atracheostomy on 4/17/06 .  Post-tracheostomy , the patientalternated between pressure support ventilation with low drivingpressure and PEEP with a trach collar..Infectious disease:1. Fevers. From 1/7/06 to 7/28/06 , the patient was treatedwith vancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime for hospitalacquired pneumonia. After discontinuation of her antibiotics ,the patient continued to spike fevers and evidence ofleukocytosis. In verification into source of her fevers includedserial blood cultures , urine cultures and C-dif. Positive dataincluded: 7/28/06 , urine culture with yeast , 7/28/06 , bloodculture with coag-negative staph , 9/14/06 BAL washings with HSV ,9/14/06 , blood culture with coag-negative staph , 7/11/06 , bloodculture with coag-negative staph , 2/29/06 , urine culture withyeast , 2/29/06 BAL washings with MRSA , 10/28/06 urine with yeasturine with yeast , 10/28/06 , 6/23/06 , 4/17/06 , and 10/11/06sputum with MRSA. 7/28/06 , chest CT with bilateralopacification in the lung parenchyma. 2/29/06 facial CT withleft sphenoid maxillary thickening. 2/29/06 chest CT withbilateral opacification in the lung parenchyma. Of note , a2/29/06 abdominal CT showed no evidence of abdominal infection ,2/29/06 TTE showed no obvious vegetations , and 10/11/06 tap ofthe right knee grew no organisms. In light of the data above ,the patient's indwelling catheters were changed. She underwenttreatment with linezolid x7 days for MRSA line infection. Shealso underwent treatment with acyclovir x10 days for HSVtracheobronchitis. The aforementioned antibiosis was mostlyprophylactic. It was thought that the patient's intermittentfevers were not infectious , but rather reflected a drug allergy ,most likely to vancomycin. This hypothesis was supported by arobust eosinophilia coinciding with vancomycin administration.Shortly after vancomycin discontinuation , the patient's feversresolved. The patient was afebrile for greater than 48 hours offall antibiotics prior to transfer to rehabilitation.Cardiovascular:1. Volume status. The patient's admission weight was 106.2 kg.It is unclear what her dry weight was. Given that pulmonaryedema was thought to be contributing to the patient's slowventilator wean , she was diuresed with a combination of Lasix andDiuril followed by combinations of torsemide and Diuril. Herdischarge weight was 100.7 kilograms. Her diuretic regimen ondischarge with torsemide 100 mg IV t.i.d. and Diuril 500 mg IVt.i.d. The patient's diuretic regimen will need be adjusted asher intake is adjusted. Her creatinine will need to be monitoredvery closely. Her weight will need to be checked daily.2. Pump: The patient underwent echocardiogram on 11/19/06 ,7/17/06 , and 2/29/06 .  On the whole , these studies revealed anejection fraction of 45-50% , concentric LVH , global hypokinesiswith regional variation , mild left atrial enlargement , mildtricuspid regurgitation , a question of mild atrial stenosis , andpulmonary artery pressures in the 40s. For her heart failure ,the patient was treated with Lopressor and diuretics as above.She was not started on an ACE inhibitor given her allergy( cough ). She was started on low-dose ARB.3. Ischemia: The patient has a history of coronary arterydisease status post three-vessel CABG and subsequentsingle-vessel PPI. She has an RCA stenosis , 70-80% that has notintervened upon. On admission , in the setting of respiratorydistress , the patient was in sinus tachycardia with rate relatedto lateral ST depressions. Her cardiac biomarkers were positiveconsistent with NSTEMI. It was thought that the patientexperienced demand ischemia rather than an acute plaque rupture.On 10/8/06 , her troponin peaked at 8.53 , her CK at 275 , and herMB of 16.3. The patient was treated with aspirin , Lopressor , andZocor. She was not started on an ACE inhibitor as detailedabove. She will likely warrant Cardiology followup with possibleRCA revascularization.Neuro:1. Sedation: While intubated , the patient was treated with IVVersed and fentanyl titrated to light sedation. After hertracheostomy , the patient's Versed and fentanyl drips werediscontinued. She was treated with Seroquel at bedtime topreclude nighttime agitation. Her QTC should be monitored whileon Seroquel.GI:1. FEN: The patient initially received tube feeds via feedingtube. She underwent a PEG placement on 4/17/06 .  She continuedon tube feeds. She also passed speech and Swallow and was thusstarted on p.o. feeds with aspiration precautions. She alsoreceived supplemental multivitamins , calcium carbonate , andcholecalciferol. The patient will require speech and swallowevaluation at rehabilitation. Now that she is awake , she may beable to tolerate oral feeds with aspiration precautions.2. Bowel regimen. The patient was treated with Colace , senna ,and Dulcolax.Heme:1. Anemia: The patient has known iron deficiency anemia. Shewas continued on iron and folate. She may benefit from anoutpatient colonoscopy if she has not had one recently.2. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: On 4/24/06 , the patientwas noted to have bleeding from her tracheostomy site. She hadno hematocrit drop. She remained hemodynamically stable. Sheunderwent a bronchoscopy , which showed no active bleeding. Hermild bleeding was thought to relate to suction trauma. Herprophylactic heparin was held x1 day. It was thought that thepatient should be discharged on prophylactic heparin because herDVT risk is so high. Should the patient have intense bleedingfrom the tracheostomy site , a hematocrit drop or hemodynamicchanges. Her heparin subcu should be discontinued , herhematocrit should be monitored closely , and she should betransfused as needed. She should also at that point probablyundergo reevaluation by Pulmonary or Thoracics.Endocrine:1. Diabetes: The patient was treated with Lantus plus regularinsulin q. 6h. plus sliding scale insulin while she was on tubefeeds. Her insulin was changed on the night prior to discharge.She was started on Lantus 100 subq b.i.d. She got her first doseof 100 units subq on the evening prior to discharge , her morningsugars were in the mid 100s. Her blood sugars should be followedclosely on the first one or two days at rehab. The blood sugarsshould be monitored every 2-3 hours and her insulin should beadjusted accordingly. Her insulin dose should be adjusted if hertube feeds are cycled rather than given continuously or if she isNPO.Ortho:1. Total knee replacement: The patient is status post righttotal knee replacement on 8/19/06 .  Her right knee has awell-healed incision and is not erythematous or tender. Thepatient was initially on low-dose anticoagulation with Coumadin.Her Coumadin was discontinued given her acute illness and herneed for procedures. She was treated with heparin subqprophylactic doses 5000 units t.i.d. as described above. Shewill need rehabilitation for her knee.2. Prophylaxis: The patient was treated with subcutaneousheparin and Nexium.3. Access: The patient has peripheral IVs.DISCHARGE STATUS:On the day of discharge 3/8/06 , the patient was afebrile.Heart rate was in the 80s , blood pressure was in the100s-130s/60s-80s. Discharge weight was 100.7 kilograms. Thepatient was drowsy , but arouseable. She was breathing on a trachcollar. She had decreased breath sounds at the bases. She hadan S1 and S2 with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the lower sternalborder. Her abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowelsounds. Her trach and PEG site were intact without anysurrounding erythema. Her extremities were warm without edema.She was on trach collar with 50% FiO2 and oxygen saturation of97%. Her discharge labs included a white blood cell count of 21 ,stable , hematocrit of 28 , and platelets 436 , 000. Her chem-7included a sodium of 131 , potassium 3 , chloride 87 , CO2 32 , BUN67 , creatinine 0.8 , and glucose 154. Her LFTs were normal. HerINR was 1.1. Her most recent microdata showed sputum with fewpolys and a few gram-positive cocci in clusters. Her chest x-rayshowed a trach in place and bilateral hazy infiltrate consistentwith resolving ARDS.An addendum will be given with discharge medications and doses.At rehab , the patient's weight should be monitored daily. Herblood sugars initially be monitored every 2-3 hours. After that ,her blood sugar monitoring can be spaced out to t.i.d. orwhenever deemed appropriate by the physician at therehabilitation facility. Her hematocrit should be checkedparticularly if she has any bleeding from her tracheostomy site;otherwise , the hematocrit can be checked every day. The whiteblood cell count should be monitored if the patient has anyfever. The creatinine should be monitored daily in light of thepatient's changing diuretic regimen. The patient in's and out'sshould be monitored closely.CONTACTS AT THE HOSPITAL:Liri Hospital Of regarding the patient's inpatient course orDr. Julio Golding .

While in the emergencydepartment , the patient had an episode of substernal chestpressure radiating to his left jaw and left upper extremity. Hereceived sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine with relief. EKGat that time revealed a right bundle-branch block with T-waveinversions in the leads V2 , V3 , and slightly T-wave elevation inleads II , III and aVF. On 1/5/06 , he underwent cardiaccatheterization , which revealed the following , posteriordescending coronary artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , rightcoronary artery with a distal 60% stenosis , left circumflexcoronary artery with the proximal 60% stenosis , left anteriordescending coronary artery with an ostial 50% stenosis. Rightdominant circulation and right coronary artery had extensivestenting with 50-60% focal areas of restenosis. Distal rightcoronary artery stent before bifurcation has 80% stenosis.Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% aorticstenosis with a mean gradient of 41 mmHg and peak gradient of 60mmHg , calculated valve area is 1 cm2 , mild aortic insufficiency ,moderate mitral insufficiency , moderate tricuspid insufficiency ,and mild pulmonic insufficiency. Carotid ultrasound revealedright internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis , leftinternal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis.

Total bypass time was 164 minutes. Totalcrossclamp time was 127 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patientwas found to have a calcified trileaflet valve functionally was abicuspid due to effusion between the left and right cusp ,moderate adhesions in the left pleural space , requiringadhesiolysis to harvest the mammary artery. Transesophagealechocardiogram post-repair revealed normal function of the aorticprosthetic valve and mild mitral regurgitation , with intermittentheart block following bypass predominantly with A pacing. Thepatient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass withoutincident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinusrhythm and in stable condition.

She was treated initially on the Medicine Service whereshe was aggressively diuresed but was requiring increasingpressors and progressing in her CHF despite transfer to the CCUand appropriate management by the medical team. On 1/10/05 , atransplant heart became available , and she proceeded to undergo aheart transplant.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Diabetes , renal failure , gout and obesity.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:Tubal ligation , gastric stapling for obesity , and a Hickmanplacement.MEDICATIONS AT HOME:Lovenox 40 mg q. daily , Lasix 30 IV continuously , dobutamine 5 IVcutaneously , milrinone 0.3 mcg/kg/ minute , Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d. , sliding scale insulin , metolazone 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,probenecid 500 mg p.o. daily , thiamine 50 mg p.o. daily ,vancomycin 1 gram IV b.i.d. MVI therapeutic one tab p.o. daily ,carnitine 0.5 grams p.o. t.i.d. , and Celexa 30 mg p.o. daily.HOSPITAL COURSE:The patient was initially treated on the Medicine Service but on1/10/05 was taken to the operating room by the Cardiac SurgeryService for a heart transplant. For detailed description of theoperative procedure , please see the dictated OP note. Thepatient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the Walklos Ey Trham Aupids Lubfranna ICUin a critical condition.ICU COURSE BY SYSTEMS:Neurological: Initially , the patient was kept sedated onpropofol as well as intermittent fentanyl and Versed. As she wasweaned towards extubation , her sedating medications were weanedand she was extubated while on Precedex due to her history ofanxiety. Her Precedex was eventually weaned off and she wasneurologically intact but frequently confused and oftendisoriented. Over the next several days , has continued to weanand she was restarted on her Celexa as well as Ativan foragitation and anxiety. At the time of transfer , she isneurologically intact with no focal neurological deficits and sheis no longer confused. She is awake , alert and oriented toperson , place and time and completely appropriate in her speech.Cardiovascular: Shortly after her operation , she was felt to bein profound right heart failure. She was started on milrinonewith successive treatment of her right heart failure. Over thenext several days , she was weaned off slowly her pressors andunderwent an echocardiogram which showed moderate-to-severe TRand a large pericardial effusion with some indentation of theright atrium with respiration. However , no pericardiocentesiswas performed as the patient was not clinically in tamponade.She underwent a cardiac catheterization for right heart biopsy ,the results of which are still pending. At the present time , sheis on diltiazem 15 mg p.o. q.8h. for hypertension as well asmilrinone 0.2. Cardiology is following and plans to keep themilrinone going for the time being.Pulmonary. The patient was kept intubated for the first severaldays while she was unstable and on pressors. However , as shebegan to improve , we weaned towards extubation , and she wassuccessfully extubated. At the current time , she is able toambulate on room air and has no pulmonary issues.GI: The patient was kept n.p.o. for the first seven days afterher operation. After her extubation , a Dobbhoff feeding tube wasinserted and she was started on tube feeds until she was able toclear her speech and swallow. Upon clearing her speech andswallow evaluation , she was started on minced food with thickenedliquids , which she tolerated with minimal signs or symptoms ofaspiration. She was advanced to a house diet with thickenedliquids and is now taking that well and having normal bowelmovements. She is on Nexium for GI prophylaxis.GU: Initially , she was given a lot of fluid in order to wean herpressors; however , she was diuresed aggressively after the firsttwo postoperative days for currently being on a Lasix drip orreceiving large bolus doses of Lasix. Her creatinine has trendedup minorly postoperatively to a current level of 1.8. She is nolonger receiving any diuretics and is just being managed bykeeping her I's and O's even. She is on no nephrotoxicmedications.Heme: She is frequently anemic with her hematocrit oftentrending downwards to levels as low as 20 or 21. She has beentransfused with multiple units of blood products and will betransfused today one unit of packed red cells for a hematocrit of21. She has been started on Niferex for iron therapy , and we areconsidering the addition of erythropoietin. Otherwise , she isstable and has no heme issues.ID and Immunosuppression:She has been immunosuppressed on various different medications.Her current regimen is Cellcept 1500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Neoral 125mg p.o. b.i.d. , prednisone 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. For prophylaxis ,she is also on Valcyte 450 mg p.o. daily , and Bactrim one doublestrength tab q.o.d. as well as nystatin swish and swallow andpowders for her axilla and groin. She has not spiked any tempsand none of her cultures have been positive except for oneurinary culture positive for Gram-negative rods for which she ison levofloxacin 250 daily for seven days.Endocrine: Her sugars have been very difficult control. She wasinitially on the Portland protocol for several dayspostoperatively and on an insulin drip according to her sugarlevels. Diabetes Management Service was consulted and has beenassessing her daily for her insulin needs.

HYPERTENSION.2. HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.3. SCIATICA.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old womanwith a history of coronary arterydisease , hypertension and chronic pain , admitted with chest pain.Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension , increased cholesterol ,positive family history and history of coronary artery disease. Shehas a history of Q wave myocardial infarction with rightventricular infarct in October 1992. Peak CK's were 2300.Catheterization showed 100% RCA lesion which was treated withangioplasty reduced to 20-30% stenosis. The patient had chest painthe succeeding months and had two catheterizations showing nochange in her coronary arteries. Echocardiogram showed an LVEF of50%. Subsequent catheterization October 92 , July 92 and September 92for atypical chest pain , showed clean coronaries. Exercise treadmill test in September 92 , the patient went three minutes and 31 secondswith standard Bruce protocol and stopped secondary to atypicalchest pain. Maximum heart rate 162 , blood pressure 176/90 , no STor T wave changes. In April 92 she ruled out for myocardialinfarction by enzymes and EKG , after presenting with prolongedchest pain. VQ scan was low probability. Chest CT ruled out aorticdissection. The patient was referred to the Pain Service. InFebruary 1993 the patient had additional sharp chest pain , againruled out for myocardial infarction , was seen by the Pain Servicesand discharged on trazodone and Relafen plus cardiac medicines.The patient now presents to the hospital with 24 hours of rightsided chest pain , stating that it was squeezing in her rightbreast , felt to be between the shoulder blades. She took twosublingual Nitroglycerin the day before admission and three on themorning of admission without relief. She complained of shortness ofbreath , dizziness , weakness and nausea , no palpitations were noted.The pain was not worse with positional changes. The patient is seenin the Sonri Health emergency room where she receivedtwo sublingual Nitroglycerins which reduced her pain from 7/10 to1/10 level. She also received 10 mg IV Morphine , 725 mg IVLopressor , two inches Nitro Paste and two liters of oxygen. Thepain was intermittent through the rest of the day. She had nofever , chills , cough , she did complain of urinary frequency ,chronic left back pain and right lower extremity pain. ALLERGIES:Penicillin , erythromycin and tetracycline which causes hives.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pulse 92 , blood pressure 148/100 ,temperature 98.1 , she is an obese female inno acute distress. Cardiac , regular rate and rhythm , SI , SII , nomurmurs , rubs or gallops. The pain is not reproducible bypalpation. Extremities , 1+ edema of the lower extremities withpreserved peripheral pulses.LABORATORY DATA: Cholesterol 226. EKG showed normal sinus rhythmof 90 beats per minute , normal intervals , leftventricular hypertrophy. There were T wave inversions in Leads I ,V2 , V6 , bisphasic T waves V5 , flat waves V3 , V4 , left atrialenlargement. Compared with the examination of 2/7/93 T waveinversions were less deep in V3 through V5.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction byserial EKG and enzymes. Her blood pressure wasinitially poorly controlled and she was placed on a regimen ofAldomet 750 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Lopressor 150 mg p.o. t.i.d.;Nifedipine XL 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. On 11/28/93 the patient underwentcardiac catheterization which showed normal coronary arteries ,mildly elevated pulmonary pressure of 40/24 and mean of 30 ,capillary wedge pressure of 14 mm mercury. On the afternoon of5/10 the patient had 600 mg of Levatol and two hours latercomplained of light-headedness with a systolic blood pressure inthe 80's. This gradually increased to greater than 110 systolic sothe patient was placed in Trendelenburg position and received 400cc's of IV fluids. She was also noted to have the onset ofwheezing. 02 sat was 95% on five liters of oxygen , chest x-rayshowed cardiac enlargement with regeneration of the pulmonary flowsuggestive of mild congestive heart failure. The patient receivedalbuterol nebs q 15 minutes x 4 with good response and was felt tohave had a bronchospastic reaction to beta blockers. She did wellfor the rest of her hospitalization , had no further chest pain.DISPOSITION: She was discharged in good condition to home withinstructions to followup with Dr. Kasten on TuesdayMay .

Pulmonary fibrosis.2. Pulmonary hypertension.3. Diverticulitis.4. Acute renal failure.5. Gout.6. Hypertension.7. High cholesterol.8. Diabetes Mellitus.BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-oldfemale with a past medical history of significant obesity ,diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , heart failure ,pulmonary fibrosis , on home O2 who presented with shortness ofbreath , and left jaw pain on 8/10/2003 .  She had been in herusual state of health until approximately 6 p.m. on the day ofadmission , when at that time , she suddenly became short ofbreath. She reports that she then sat down in her wheelchair and"passed out." However , it is unclear if the patient actuallylost consciousness. The patient also developed jaw painradiating to her back while EMTs were present and also complainedof a tug in her chest. The pain was unrelieved by nitroglycerin ,oxygen; it was constant in nature. At the time of her arrival inthe emergency room , the patient was hemodynamically stable withan O2 sat of 99% on room air. She was given sublingual nitratewith no effect. Because of her history of coronary arterydisease , she was tried on heparin and aspirin.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Pulmonary fibrosis , on home O2.2. Reported history of an anterolateral MI.3. Diabetes.4. Hypertension.5. High cholesterol.MEDICATIONS: On admission , insulin 70/30 22 units q.a.m. 26units q.p.m. , atenolol 25 q.d. , Zocor 20 q.d. , Zoloft 50 q.d. ,Lasix 60 p.o. b.i.d. , Neurontin 100 t.i.d. , aspirin , andmultivitamin.ALLERGIES: Penicillin.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature was 97 , pulsewas 54-60 , blood pressure was 100-120/50-80 , and O2 sat was 98%to 99% on 6 liters. She was a moderately obese woman in no acutedistress. Her lung are notable for crackles at the bases. Hercardiac exam was notable for distant heart sounds with a normalS1 , S2. She had no pedal edema in her extremities.LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for a BUN andcreatinine of 31 and 1.1. Normal LFTs The patient's hematocritwas 38. Her D-dimer was 736.Her EKG showed normal sinus at low voltages , poor R-waveprogression.IMPRESSION: At the time of admission , the patient was a62-year-old female with morbid obesity and chronic episodes ofshortness of breath , this time accompanied by jaw pain and with ahistory of coronary artery disease and multiple risk factorsconcerning for acute coronary syndrome. The patient wasinitially treated for a possible ischemic event. Diagnosis of PEresults were considered. However , the patient was nottachycardic. She did not have any chest pain or new O2requirements and had had several workups for pulmonary embolismduring prior hospitalization with similar systems , so therefore ,this was thought to be less likely.HOSPITAL COURSE: By system:CARDIAC. In terms of ischemia , the patient had 3 tests ofcardiac enzymes , which returned negative. She was maintained ontelemetry , and she had EKG checked , which did not reveal anychanges. This was a patient who had a dobutamine MIBI , which wasnegative for any evidence of ischemic changes. During the MIBI ,there was no evidence of ischemia and/or scar. The patient wascontinued on her outpatient medications including aspirin , Zocor ,and atenolol. However , at a later point in her hospitalization ,she became hypotensive at which time her atenolol was temporarilyDC'd , but this was restarted prior to discharge. In terms of thepatient's cardiac function , she has a history of CHF and is onLasix as an outpatient. An echocardiogram was repeated duringthis hospitalization , which was notable for an EF of 60% ,trace-to-mild MR , moderate TR , and estimated pulmonary systolicpressure at 70 mmHg. The patient was continued on outpatientLasix regimen until at a later point during this hospitalization ,the patient became hypertensive with acute renal failure at whichtime her Lasix was discontinued. Lasix was restarted prior todischarge. In terms of the patient's rhythm , she had no evidenceof arrhythmias monitored throughout her hospitalization.GI. On 10/10/2003 , the patient developed acute onset of diarrheaand lower abdominal pain. Now , this pain was nonradiating ,alternating sharp and dull but constant , associated with nauseaand vomiting , and frequent stools. At times , the stools werenotable for bright red blood. The patient was therefore startedon levofloxacin and Flagyl as treatment for diverticulitis versusischemic colitis. To further evaluate this , a CT scan of theabdomen was done , which was notable for a thickened colon for 10cm at the hepatic flexure. Given this information , it was the GIconsult's opinion that this is most likely consistent withdiverticulitis , and the plan was to treat it aggressively withantibiotics , and once the symptoms resolved , recommended acolonoscopy several weeks after discharge. The patient wascontinued on levofloxacin and Flagyl , but then , several dayslater , became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the80s. At this time , the patient's antibiotic coverage was changedto include Ceptaz and vancomycin , and she also received 1 dose ofgentamicin. By the time of discharge , the patient's abdominalsymptoms have completely resolved. She is no longer having anyabdominal pain , and she needs no longer having any diarrhea andis tolerating a regular diet without any difficulties. The planis for her to have a followup colonoscopy as an outpatient.PULMONARY: The patient was admitted for shortness of breath. Adifferential diagnosis at that time included chronic pulmonaryembolism versus cardiac etiology versus deconditioning in thesetting of a chronic pulmonary fibrosis. To establish that thepatient did not have any PE , she had lower extremity Dopplerexams , which were negative. She also had a PT protocol CT , whichwas negative for any evidence of clots. Because the patient doeshave cardiopulmonary hypertension , she was started on Coumadin asprophylaxis for any thrombosis in the setting of her low flow inher pulmonary vasculature. Throughout this hospitalization , shewas continued on her own home regimen of O2.RENAL: The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency witha baseline creatinine at 1.4 during this hospitalization at atime that her diarrhea was very severe , and when her bloodpressures fell in the 80s , the patient developed acute renalfailure with a peak creatinine of 2.4 with decreased urineoutput. The thought of the team was that this represented arenal failure in the setting of her diarrhea , fluid losses , andhypertension. Her pheno was consistent with this at 0.71. Shewas treated with aggressive IV fluids. She also had a renalultrasound , which was normal. She did have 1 day of hematuria ,which was thought to be due most likely to Foley trauma , whichresolved at the time of discharge.ID: The patient's hospital course was notable for a diarrhea asmentioned in GI. She was initially treated with levofloxacin andFlagyl and then when she became hypertensive was then change herFlagyl , Ceptaz , and vancomycin with 1 dose of gentamicin. Hersymptoms dramatically improved on these antibiotics on 9/18 shewas changed from IV antibiotics to a p.o. regimen of Flagyl andlevofloxacin. The plan is for her to continue a total of 14 daysof antibiotics. I anticipate the last day of antibiotic coveragewill be 2/19/2003 .RHEUMATOLOGY: On 10/27/2003 , the patient was noted to have leftknee pain and was noted to have some focal lateral patellartenderness and swelling. A knee aspirate was performed and uratecrystals were identified , and the patient was diagnosed withgout. Because of her chronic renal insufficiency and diarrhea ,the decision was made to treat her gout flare with steroids , andshe is currently is on a steroid taper as treatment.ENDOCRINE: The patient has a history of diabetes. She takes70/30 insulin at home. She was initially continued on anoutpatient regimen; however , when she started to begin havingmassive diarrhea , she was taken off her long-acting insulin ,because she was not taking anything by p.o. At this time , shewas not tolerating a regular diet , and her insulin requirementswere increasing. It is recommended that as an outpatient , sheresumes one-half of her regular outpatient insulin dose for 1 or2 days to ensure that her insulin requirements in her diet areappropriate , and then , she should resume her regular insulindosage.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zoloft 50 mgp.o. q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,prednisone taper - which involves 10 mg of prednisone on 8/14followed by 5 mg of prednisone on 10/27 , 1/24 , and 3/1 andthen stop , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , insulin 70/30 11 unitsq.a.m. 13 units q.p.m. - once it is established that the patienthas returned to her regular diet , this dosage should be doubledto her outpatient regular dose , and Flexeril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.DISPOSITION: The patient has been discharged to a rehabfacility.FOLLOWUP: The patient is to follow up with her primary carephysician , Dr. Hargus following discharge.ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Antibiotics should be continued until2/19/2003 .

The patient has a history of type Idiabetes mellitus , end-stage renal disease withsubsequent renal transplant 11 years ago donated by his sisterfor which he takes cyclosporine and azathioprine. The patienthad a neuropathic left plantar ulcer seven years ago for which heunderwent transmetatarsal amputation of his left foot at Reus Ortston University Of Medical Center .He has had a chronic recurrent ulcer of the left footover the last two years or so. The patient nonetheless wasreasonably doing well and very active. He recently did a 35-milebike ride in about four or five days prior to admission. Hedeveloped nausea and vomiting which lasted for one day. He thendeveloped weakness and hyperglycemia. He tried to increase hisinsulin , but found he did not have an adequate response. Thepatient became more weak and was brought to the Copot Memorial Health Centers Emergency Department where he was found to have moderatediabetic ketoacidosis and dehydration. The patient's workup alsosuggested acute myocardial infarction and was admitted to theCoronary Care Unit. Echocardiogram was performed which revealedan ejection fraction of 30% with dyskinesis of the inferior andapical walls , mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspidinsufficiency. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mild leftatrial enlargement and intact interatrial septum , mild mitralregurgitation , left atrium with history of thrombus ,inferobasilar and inferoseptal akinesis consistent with oldinferoposterior myocardial infarction , mild tricuspidregurgitation , trileaflet aortic valve , which is quite mobilewith no evidence for significant aortic insufficiency , normalpulmonic valve and aortic atherosclerosis. No pericardialeffusion and no evidence of endocarditis. The patient developeda fever the day of admission and blood cultures were drawn whichgrew out Streptococcus morbillorum and Bacteroides. His footbecame clearly boggy and grossly infected with necrosis.Within an hour of that he underwent guillotine amputation of hisleft foot. His temperature normalized and his foot cultures grewout Streptococcus mutans and E. coli as well as Bacteroidesfragilis. He received ampicillin and sulbactam for bacteremia on11/2/06 .  He underwent a coronary cardiac catheterization andwas found to have the following , left main coronary artery withan ostial 100% stenosis. Formal report is not available at thistime. The patient was then transferred to Johni Hospital for coronary artery bypass grafting.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for myocardial infarction ,history of class II heart failure , hypertension , peripheralvascular disease , diabetic vasculopathy , renal failure andnephropathy.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for left transmetatarsalamputation , recent left guillotine amputation of left foot andrenal transplant 11 years ago.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mgdaily , aspirin 325 mg daily , cyclosporine 50 mg b.i.d. ,azathioprine 125 mg daily , NPH insulin 74 units in the morningand 72 units in the evening.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A 6 feet 2 inches tall , 113.63 kilograms ,temperature 98.6 , heart rate 79 and regular , blood pressure rightarm 130/65 , left arm 137/68 , oxygen saturation 97% on room air.Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 holosystolicmurmur.

Total bypass time was 121minutes. Total crossclamp time was 104 minutes. The patient didwell intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident and wasbrought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and instable condition. Postoperatively , the patient did well. He wasextubated and transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperativeday #1. Infectious Disease Service was called and recommendedtreating the patient with levofloxacin and Flagyl for total of 14days for his left leg BKA site. The patient's chest tubes wereremoved and post-pull chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax.Dr. Chang Eichberger from the Vascular Surgery Service was consulted andthe patient was scheduled for revision of his left BKA on11/9/06 .  Mr. Strathman was also followed by the Diabetes MellitusService postoperatively for his insulin regimen. He alsoexperienced some postoperative urinary retention with severalfailed voiding trials. The patient will be discharged with a legbag and will follow up with a urologist within five to seven days who will beassigned by his primary care physician. Thepatient had already been started on Flomax 0.4 mg daily. Thepatient also worked with physical therapy and is able to pivotwith assist and will be discharged to home with physical therapy. Mr. Farrelly wascleared for discharge to home with visiting nurse and PT on postoperative day#11. Mr. Berne also had postoperative anemia and was transfused with one unit ofpacked red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22 with a repeat at timeof discharge to 23.4.

Theophylline causes tongue swelling.3. Quinine reaction unclear.4. Iodine/IV contrast. This is noted in the medical record.However , the patient does not remember having an adverse reactionor allergic reaction to IV contrast.5. Iron , this reaction is unknown.6. Erythromycin , again , the patient does not remember anyreaction , but apparently has hives.7. Levofloxacin , unclear what the reaction is. She hastolerated this in April , which she was treated for a footulcer. It is not clear if this is a rash or it was thought to bepossibly related to a fever that the patient had , but it is notclear what the actual reaction is.SOCIAL HISTORY:The patient is an 80-pack-year smoker. He is currently smoking.PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:Her temperature was 99 , her pulse was 98 , her blood pressure was105/55. Her respiratory rate was 18 when she was saturating 94%on room air. In general , she is in no acute distress. Her HEENTexam was unremarkable. Her cardiac exam was regular rate andrhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Her lung exam wasnotable for crackles most prominent in the left lower lobe. Herabdomen was soft , obese , nontender and nondistended with goodbowel sounds. Her extremities were significant for erythema ofthe left shin without warmth or tenderness. She also had a small1.5 cm ulceration on the bottom of her left foot which has beenpresent for sometime although she says that it looks better thanat first. There was no purulence or purulent drainage from thewound. Her neurologic exam was unremarkable.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:Her labs were notable for a creatinine of 1.6 , a white count of4.1 , with 11% eosinophils. Her hematocrit was 31.6 , and heralbumin was 3.PROCEDURES:Cardiac catheterization: it was done by Dr. Eeds .FINDINGS:Showed a right dominant circulation. There were no significantleft main lesions identified. The LAD had a tubular 90% lesionand the diagonal I had a proximal tubular 60% lesion , there wasalso a diffuse 80% lesion of the proximal circumflex. The RCAhad a proximal 75% lesion with a mid diffuse 60% lesion and a PLVtubular 70% lesion. The coronary artery bypass grafts had apatent LIMA to LAD graft , the SVG to marginal I had a 100% lesionduring this catheterization due to the moderate amount ofcontrast and the patient's chronic kidney disease , they treatedthe RCA and placed a 3 x 24 mm Taxus stentECHOCARDIOGRAM:On 7/9/07 , showed an estimated ejection fraction of 50% withinferoseptal and inferior severe hypokinesis. The RV was normal.There was mild aortic stenosis. Mild-to-moderate aorticregurgitation. The valve area was 1.2 cm2. There was mildmitral regurgitation. There is trace tricuspid regurgitationwith a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 mm plus rightatrial pressure.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Cardiovascular:a. Ischemia: The patient was admitted because they had deep Twave inversions in the lateral leads and are still concerning foranginal equivalence of nausea and vomiting. It was decided onadmission that an echocardiogram would be performed and if therewas evidence of any regional wall motion abnormalities that shewould be taken directly to cath. The echocardiogram as notedabove showed inferior hypokinesis consistent with coronary arterydisease. She was taken to the cath lab on 9/5/07 and they showtwo ____ that one of the bypass grafts was completely occludedand was not visualized. They also saw that there was a proximalRCA lesion 60% which was found to account for the inferiorhypokinesis given the right arm circulation. This was stentedwith a Taxus stent. Because of her kidney insufficiency , it wasdecided not to pursue the 80% left circ lesion and this wasdeferred until later point as this was not thought to be causingany problems. Her post cath ECG was unchanged and continued tohave the deep lateral T wave inversions. She did not complain ofany chest pain or nausea and vomiting during her admission. Shewas started on aspirin and Plavix initially although as notedbelow she did have an apparent allergy to Plavix and thus wasswitched to ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. instead of Plavix foranticoagulation. She was also continued Lipitor 80 mg daily ,Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d. After her cath , it was originally plannedthat she would go back to cath for intervention on the leftcirculation lesion , however , given her other medical problems andher relative stability hemodynamically and symptomatically , itwas decided that they would wait and decide later if this lesionneeded to be corrected in the future or not.b. Pump: The patient had no significant issues with her bloodpressure here. She remained in a blood pressure range of 100-120throughout her stay. She was continued on her beta blocker asnoted above. However , at discharge , this was switched back toatenolol as her home medications and she refused to changemedications , she said that she would not be able to afford newprescription. We did increase her dose of atenolol to 25 mgb.i.d. from 25 mg daily as her requirement of beta blockadeseemed to be higher than what her home dose was. Given that shehas a concurrent renal disease , it would probably be useful forher to be on an ace inhibitor ARB as well. This medicationshould be added as an outpatient , if her blood pressure toleratesit. It was on the lower side here , so we did not add it. We didnot diurese her in fact we held her Lasix on admission becauseshe seemed to be volume depleted given that she was admitted witha lot of diarrhea , this again will need to be reconsidered if shehad increased edema. This can be restarted.C: Rhythm: The patient was kept on telemetry , however , therewere no significant episodes of arrhythmias during her admission.2. GI: The patient was admitted with persistent nausea anddiarrhea from Tlmamuthes Medical Center .  The diarrhea resolved one dayafter admission. Her fecal leukocytes were positive but her C.diff was negative. It was unclear what the etiology of thisdiarrhea was and we were going to send a repeat stool study ,however , she did not have any diarrhea afterwards and this may beantibiotics associated diarrhea but it seemed to resolvespontaneously.3. Pulmonary: The patient was admitted with crackles in theleft lower lobe and some wheezing consistent with COPD andpneumonia. A chest x-ray on admission showed a right lower lobeinfiltrate/atelectasis. We initially continued her on Augmentin ,which she was taking for her diabetic foot ulcer. However , shedid not appear to clinically respond to this medication. We heldher antibiotics as noted below in the ID section and after thather white blood cell count increased and she produced somepurulent sputum and Gram-negative rods. The Gram-negative rodswere later speciated as serratia although this information is notavailable at the time of her discharge. She was treated for ahospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime tocomplete a 14-day course. Clinically , she appeared to improve onthis regimen , although her white count was still elevated at 15on discharge , however , given her overall clinical stability , thelack of fevers and the lack of systemic symptoms. We feltcomfortable with discharging her with close follow up.4. Infectious disease: The patient was initially admitted onAugmentin for a diabetic foot ulcer , the notes from Grantnas Healthcare by the Infectious Disease Service recommended a 2-4 weekcourse of Augmentin for her diabetic foot ulcer. She hadcompleted three weeks of therapy and thus we discontinued thismedication as it did not seem that there was really any evidenceof active infection in her foot. After holding the antibioticsfor three days , her white count began to rise and she developed apurulent cough as noted above , this was thought to be ahospital-acquired pneumonia. She was treated with vancomycin andceftazidime and she will complete a 14-day course of theseantibiotics.5. Endocrine: The patient was home on oral hypoglycemics. Shewas switched to coverage with an insulin scale. Her sugars wererelatively well controlled and she did not require much in theway of supplemental insulin.6. Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease. Her baselinecreatinine was 1.5-1.6. She was admitted and had a cath. Shewas given Mucomyst and bicarbonated fluids for renal protectionduring her dilute. Because of the risk for kidneys , the cath wasdone with a little amount of dye as possible. Her creatinineremained stable throughout her admission and settled out at 1.6of her creatinine which is the baseline.ALLERGY:During the patient's admission , it was noted that she developed arash on 4/15/06 .  She was seen by the Allergy and ImmunologyService at the request of the cath lab given that there wasconcern that she had this rash because of her Plavix. They feltthat this was possible. This was the most likely etiology and inconjunction with her high eosinophil count it was felt that thiswas a drug reaction to the Plavix. She was switched toticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. and her rash appeared to improve. Shewas also given claritin as well as put on a brief prednisonetaper given her diffuse rash and her brisk eosinophilia. Sheshould follow up with Allergy and Immunology in about one monthto see if the rash has resolved and potentially to tryrechallenge with Plavix at that point.Cellulitis/diabetic foot ulcer: The patient has had alongstanding diabetic foot ulcer which has been treated by woundcare VNA and was treated at Tha Hospital .  We continued theAugmentin to a total course of three weeks and then stopped it.We continued her dressing changes and this will be followed bythe VNA at home. There was no evidence of active infection ,there was no purulence or erythema around the area of the ulcerand the erythema around the foot appeared to be stable , this wasmost likely chronic venous stasis change and not a truecellulitis as there was no warmth or tenderness in this region.CONSULTANTS:Allergy/Immunology , the attending was Dr. Frija .PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:The patient was afebrile. Her pulse was 86 , her blood pressurewas 120/60 , her respiratory rate was 20. She was 92-96% on roomair. In general , she was in no acute distress. Her JVP wasabout 7 cm. She had small amount of crackles at bilateral bases.Her cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 andS2. There was a 2/6 systolic murmur most prominent at the leftlower sternal border. Her abdomen is soft , nontender , andnondistended with good bowel sounds. She had 1+ edemabilaterally with small amounts of erythema at the distal end ofthe left lower extremity which has been stable. There is noassociated warmth or tenderness. She did have a 1.5 cm smallulcer on the ventral aspect of her left foot , which did not haveany purulence associated with it. Her neurologic exam wasnonfocal.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:Notable for a creatinine of 1.5 , a white blood cell count of15.89 , with 82.7% neutrophils , 3.8% eosinophils. Her hematocritwas 28.6. Her baseline appears to be around 30.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Ticlopidine 250 mg by mouth twice a day.2. Atenolol 25 mg by mouth b.i.d.3. Lipitor 80 mg daily.4. Prednisone taper 30 mg on 10/18/07 , 20 mg on 10/3/07 , 10 mgon 10/18/07 and then stop.5. Vancomycin 1 g IV daily , course to be completed on 1/16/07 .6. Ceftazidime 1 g daily to be complete on 1/16/07 .7. Allopurinol 100 mg daily.8. Neurontin 300 mg three times a day.9. Tessalon perles as needed.10. Ativan 0.5 mg at bedtime as needed for sleep.11. Glipizide 2.5 mg daily.12. DuoNeb every 4 hours as needed for shortness of breath.13. Lasix 30 mg by mouth daily.14. Aspirin 81 mg daily.DISPOSITION:Home with services.PENDING TESTS:As noted , the patient had a sputum culture that was growingGram-negative rods at the time of discharge. The current reportis that it was growing Serratia marcescens which should be staphsensitive to ceftazidime , which he was prescribed for a total of14 days.FOLLOW UP:She will follow up with Dr. Antony Baldonado on 10/12/07 at 9:30a.m. She has an appointment scheduled.TO DO LIST:1. The patient has an 80% left circumflex lesion which was notstented. This should be , ___28.20__ , whether she needs a secondintervention in the future. She does appear to be asymptomatic ,but she does continue to have the deep lateral T wave inversionsuggesting the areas of abnormal blood flow in the heart. It wasthought that the right RCA lesion was more likely to be the causeof her inferior wall hypokinesis , so that was the procedureperformed.2. The patient was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia withvancomycin and ceftazidime. This will continue until 1/16/07 .She was noted to have a rash here which was thought to be Plavixrelated. If the rash resolves on ticlopidine , she may need toreaddress whether or not this was actually due to Plavix. It wasrecommended that she follow up with an allergist in about a monthfrom her hospitalization who can review the records and determinewhether she should start Plavix or maintain on the ticlopidine.3. Her platelets should be monitored given that she started onticlopidine and there is a risk of TTP associated with thismedication.eScription document: 2-5081465 EMSSten TelCC: Lenard Prey M.D.Nor Ties Pro Health CareSquite Kan FallsaleriDictated By: AUGUSTYN , BURLAttending: KITE , JAMIEDictation ID 3181966D: 10/3/07T: 10/29/07

The patient's cardiac risk factorsincluded family history , borderline high cholesterol. The patienthad no prior cardiac history , until 12 of June , when he had substernalchest pain with exertion. He eventually had cardiaccatheterization which showed an 80% proximal left anteriordescending lesion with thrombosis , good left ventricular function.The patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty tothis lesion. He was without symptoms for about 4 weeks , and thenin 23 of August , the patient noted new onset chest pain and left armnumbness at rest. An electrocardiogram at that time showed sinusbradycardia at 50 , T-wave inversions in II with flat T-waves inIII , and was otherwise unremarkable. He had an exercise tolerancetest at the time and went on a 9-minute standard Bruce protocol andstopped secondary to fatigue. The electrocardiogram showed 3 to 4millimeter ST depressions in the lateral leads , which was highlypredictive of coronary artery disease. At that time , he was repeatcardiac catheterization which showed a restenosis of his leftanterior descending lesion. He had a repeat percutaneoustransluminal coronary angioplasty of the lesion withoutcomplications. The patient did well for several weeks and waspain-free. However , 6 days prior to admission , the patient beganto note occasional episodes of left arm numbness , which was alwaysrelieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. There was no accompanyingdizziness , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis. The patient at first had2 or 3 episodes a day , now increased to 7 or 8 times a day at thetime of admission. On the day of adimssion , the patient had almostconstant chest pain and arm pain which lasted almost all day , onlypartially relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient wasvery concerned about the pain , and now comes to Tes Healthcare for further evaluation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY includedarthritis , kidney stones , chronic lower back pain. MEDICATIONS ONADMISSION were Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,aspirin 325 milligrams by mouth per day , Isordil 10 milligrams bymouth 3 times a day. ALLERGIES included no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient was a retired firefighter ,occasional red wine , no tobacco use. His brother had 3 myocardialinfarctions in the past , no other FAMILY HISTORY.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile , pulse 54 , bloodpressure 104/70 , respirations 20. There wasno jugular venous distention. Chest was clear. Cardiacexamination showed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , noperipheral edema. Extremities had good pulses bilaterally indorsalis pedis , posterior tibial and femoral.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admitting laboratory values wereremarkable for potassium 4.3 , creatinine1.0 , hematocrit 40.8. The electrocardiogram showed sinusbradycardia at 50 , normal intervals , flat T-waves in AVF , V2 andV3 , QRS axis 0 degrees. Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates oreffusions , no evidence of congestive heart failure.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on a rule out myocardialinfarction protocol. He had no elevations in hisserum creatinine kinase levels. The patient continued to haveintermittent left arm numbness during his hospital stay. For thisreason , he was taken back for cardiac catheterization , which showeda 75% proximal left anterior descending lesion believed to be atthe same site as his previous percutaneous transluminal coronaryangioplasty procedures. The patient had successful percutaneoustransluminal coronary angioplasty of the lesion with a 25% residualstenosis. The patient postoperatively had no further episodes ofchest pain or arm numbness. He had no complications related to thecardiac catheterization itself. The patient was then discharged.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.

Multiple surgeries were performed withpersistent nonhealing wounds: Left great toe amputation on2/18/06 , which failed to heal despite SFA to perineal arterybypassing the composite vein. Had a short CICU stay forhypotension postoperatively , maintained on dobutamine. On7/25/06 underwent debridement of left medial ulcer. On 10/7/06transmetatarsal amputation , on 11/22/06 , debridement oftransmetatarsal amputation. On 9/22/06 received a left belowthe knee amputation. His renal function had been normal prior tothe final surgery until 5/29/06 to 8/13/06 when his creatininerose from 1.3 to 2.2. He was discharged to acute rehabilitationand was there noted to have this acute renal failure , which wasthought to be due to prerenal azotemia , but his creatinine atthis point had not changed much from 2.2 to 2.5 during his stay.Diuretics were held at rehabilitation facility until two daysprior to admission. He was noted to have increased shortness ofbreath. Patient denies any other symptoms up to that pointexcept occasional lightheadedness , depressed mood , and lack ofmotivation. No orthopnea , uses 1 pillow regularly , deniesparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and denies dyspnea on exertion , butvery limited movement.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Significant for hypertension , GERD , hypercholesterolemia , CADstatus post MI in 1996 , received a CABG in 5/12 with a LIMA toLAD , SVG to PDA , SVG to OM1 , and mitral valve annuloplasty.Diabetes mellitus , insulin-dependent , status post bilateral belowthe knee amputation , likely from diabetes related foot ulcers ,history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter , history ofsick sinus syndrome , history of second-degree heart block , AICDplaced 10/27 complicated by hematoma. History of admissions forhyponatremia. Status post left SFA to perineal artery bypass toincompetent pain in 10/14 .MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily. Atrovent one to two puffs inhaledq.i.d. p.r.n. for wheezing , Celexa 20 mg p.o. daily , Coumadin 2.5mg p.o. daily , Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily , enteric-coated aspirin325 mg p.o. daily , Lantus 25 units every day subcutaneous , Lasix160 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Lopressor 50 mgp.o. b.i.d. , therapeutic multivitamin one tablet p.o. daily ,solsite topical.IMPRESSION:On admission , a 73-year-old male with severe cardiomyopathy andejection fraction of 15% admitted for decompensated heart failurein the setting of his diuretics being held due to an acute renalfailure. Review of chart at the time of admission showed renalfailure is actually present since the perioperative period of hisBKA. After being admitted to the cardiology service , he wasdiuresed successfully to his dry weight , with a significantimprovement in his oxygen saturation , his creatinine , and venouscongestion.Other active issues he was treated for include urinary tractinfection , diabetes mellitus , acute on chronic renal failure ,depression.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Known coronary artery diseasestatus post CABG x3 , admitted with troponin elevation likely dueto demand in the setting of heart failure for having hisdiuretics held. This was noted to trend down post-diuresis. Wecontinued aspirin. Initially , we held his ACE inhibitor givenhistory of cough and his ARF , and ultimately restarted thepatient on ARB , after his creatinine had normalized. Statins hadbeen held until we were certain his liver function tests weredecreasing.2. Cardiovascular pump: The patient remained in floor volumeoverload on presentation , maintained on 2 grams salt daily , 2liters fluid restriction diet with 1-2 liters per day goaldiuresis attained by using 100 mg IV torsemide b.i.d. with theaddition of 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d. 30 minutes priorto each torsemide dose , an average of two liter fluid negative.Diuresis was affected over the course of a week , and his statusgradually improved. Spironolactone was initially held due tohigh K but was re-added on 7/20/06 .  His jugular venousdistention dropped from initial presentation above the earlobesat a 30-degree angle to a JVP of 6-7 cm at 30 degree angle on theday of discharge. Two days prior to discharge , his creatininebegan to rise , suggesting prerenal azotemia secondary to overdiuresis and when his torsemide was reduced to 100 mg p.o. daily ,hydrochlorothiazide was dropped from his regimen , patient'screatinine began to drop again , and patient was able to maintaineven Ins and Outs of fluid for two days prior to discharge.3. Cardiovascular rhythm: Patient is ventricularly paced onsymmetry for duration of hospitalization , history of atrialfibrillation on Coumadin , was maintained on amiodarone duringthis hospitalization.4. Pulmonary: The patient with initial O2 dependence.Continued inhaled ipratropium his home medication. Afterdiuresis , the patient was able to achieve oxygen saturation of100% on room air.5. Renal: Initial acute on chronic renal failure thoughtsecondary to volume overload and forward flow in the context ofdecompensated congestive heart failure. His renal functionimproved , as he was diuresed and his heart likely moved to moreuseful part of the starling curve. Renal ultrasound was negativefor hydronephrosis as was test for urine eosinophils.Hyponatremia was likely due to heart failure improved withdiuresis.6. Heme: The patient maintained on Coumadin with an INR goal of2-3. In order to achieve this goal , his Coumadin dose wasadjusted to mg p.o. every other day. He will be followed bychemo and Coumadin service after discharge with weekly tests tomake sure that his INR is maintained within this range.7. Endocrine. Diabetes mellitus , insulin-dependent , covered onNPH q.a.m. and q.p.m. with aspartate sliding scale for durationof hospitalization.8. Psych: The patient was restarted on Celexa per PCP forlikely depressive mood response to recent bilateral kneeamputation. It is what is quite possible that patient'sdepression precedes the bilateral knee amputation and informsmuch of his overall care. The patient's PCP , Dr. Micheal L Davirro , aware of the situation and managing as outpatient. Thepatient was also seen by the inpatient psychiatry consultation ,and started on Remeron 7.5 mg p.o. daily in place of Celexa. Heis discharged on this medication. The patient is status post onefall from the bed during the hospitalization. Head CT at thattime showed no evidence of bleed or trauma to the head to head.Examination of back and extremities reveals no focal tendernessor ecchymoses.9. Infectious disease. The patient initially treated forurinary tract infection with uncomplicated course withciprofloxacin.10. Wound: Wound care nurse consulted for BKA wound and smalldecubitus on his back , was treated with DuoDERM , BKA site healingwell.11. Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient remained oncardiac , 2000 calorie diabetic diet , however , as it becameapparent that he was severely malnourished , his diet wasliberalized to allow for nutritional supplementation.12. PPX: The patient maintained on subcutaneous heparin andNexium as DVT and GI prophylaxis during this hospitalization.13. Code status , full code.TO DO PLAN1. Discharge the patient to rehab on current regimen. Patienthas been working with PT and OT during this hospitalization andappears well positioned to take advantage of rehabilitationfacilities services.2. Maintain new prescription of Remeron , follow up withpsychiatry to assess depressive disorder/adjustment disorder.3. The patient has been off beta-blocker. PCP may choose tostart beta-blocker at a low-dose in the outpatient setting.4. Fasciculations noted during hospitalization finefasciculations at hands in Surga Hospital .  Maybe secondary tomalnutrition and diaries is , but may merit further workup in anoutpatient context.5. The patient had rising alkaline phosphatase duringhospitalization , CT of chest incidentally showed gallstonepresent within the gallbladder , follow up LFTs in the outpatientcontext and possible right upper quadrant ultrasound may meritconsideration and further outpatient workup of this patient. Thepatient will follow up with Coumadin clinic given goal INR of2.0-3.0. The patient's creatinine and BUN should be checkedalong with electrolytes to make sure patient is doing well oncurrent maintenance diuretic schedule of 100 mg torsemide p.o.daily and spironolactone.CODE STATUS:Full code.DISCHARGE CONDITION:Stable.

In terms of hispneumonia that was evident right lower lobe pneumonia on chestx-ray and the patient was also spiking fevers and had audiblerales on exam.In terms of GI , the patient continued tolerate regular diet andnutrition continued to follow ensuring adequate p.o. intake andadjusting diet per endocrine needs.In terms of endocrine , the addendum to 6/13/06 , the patientultimately discontinued on a regimen of 7 units of Lantus q.a.m.and q.p.m. with 5 units aspart q.a.c. breakfast and lunch and 4units of aspart q.a.c. dinner. His sliding scale was very lightand he is only to be covered with one to two units of aspartduring the night as insulin stacks in this patient very easily.It was recommended if the patient is noted to be in the low 100sconsistently through the course of the day that his next dose ofaspart be either halved or held as the patient easily becomeshypoglycemic and is unable to recognize the symptoms ofhypoglycemia himself. At the time of discharge , the patient'sfingersticks were well controlled in the 100-200 range.In terms of ID , the patient began to spike fevers on 9/22/06with a T. max of 100.6 and blood cultures failed to show anythingas did sputum cultures. On 5/18/06 , the patient spiked to 101.2and had evidence of pneumonia on his chest x-ray. He was startedon antibiotics of ceftriaxone and Flagyl , which was switched tocefpodoxime and Flagyl for discharge. The cefpodoxime should bedosed after dialysis on Monday-Wednesday-Friday.In terms of disposition , the patient has been discharged to rehabwhere he will continue hemodialysis on Monday-Wednesday-Fridayand continues to have the same medication Rx as he did well inhouse.

Final pathologyduring this procedure was serositis. Her postoperative coursewas complicated by severe delirium , atrial fibrillation ,abdominal abscesses requiring IR drainage in 10/10 and 10/7 .The patient began having recurrent UTI , decreased appetite andhematochezia at this time. On 8/17/05 , a CT of the abdomenshowed evidence of a colovesical fistula and the patient wasadmitted to the Ore Of for further management.On admission , she was found to be in acute renal failure with acreatinine of 2.3 apparently secondary to dehydration afterrecently having been started on Lasix for hypertension by herprimary care physician.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Coronary artery disease.2. Pulmonary hypertension.3. Chronic atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin.4. Hypercholesterolemia.5. Asthma.6. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.7. Hypothyroidism.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:Appendectomy in 5/25 .MEDICATIONS AT HOME:1. Atrovent b.i.d.2. Metaxalone 2.5 mg daily.3. Lipitor 10 mg daily.4. Lasix 60 mg daily.5. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.6.

Coumadin.ALLERGIES:No known drug allergies.HOSPITAL COURSE:The patient was admitted to the Anorwin Hospital .  Her creatinineimproved with IV hydration on 3/25/05 .  She was taken to theoperating room for exploratory laparotomy , cystoscopy withbilateral urinary stent placement , sigmoid colectomy with primaryanastomosis and diverting ileostomy. During the surgery , shebecame hypotensive requiring pressors due to inability to replaceIV fluid adequately. She was transferred to the surgicalintensive care unit , intubated on pressors. For the firstseveral days , she had a inflammatory response-type picture withsignificant vasodilation requiring pressors and massive IVresuscitation greater than 30 liters of fluid. Sedation wasslowly weaned as the patient's respiratory status improved. Dueto a question of responsiveness during the first several days , ahead CT was performed which showed no evidence of stroke. Shebecame slowly more responsive as sedation was weaned with the useof Precedex and was extubated on 1/22/05 , postoperative day 7without complications. Her mental status in the intensive careunit continued to improve. The remainder of the patient'shospital course will be dictated via systems.Neurologically , at the time of transfer out of the ICU , thepatient was noted to have subtly improving mental status. Herfamily described her at baseline. During her stay on the floor ,her Zyprexa dose was decreased. She had no further neurologicissues.Cardiovascular: In the intensive care unit , the patient requiredvasopressin initially and was weaned off during the first threeor four days. Her chronic atrial fibrillation continued. Shewas transferred out of the intensive care unit on IV Lopressorwhich was gradually converted to p.o. as she tolerated a regulardiet. She was discharged on 100 mg q.i.d. of Lopressor.Respiratory: In the intensive care unit , she was noted to haverespiratory failure initially secondary to a SIRS picture andfluid overload. This significantly improved with diuresis. Shewas transferred out on a nasal cannula. On the floor , she had norespiratory issues. She continued her aggressive chest physicaltherapy and was out of bed with physical therapist.GI: In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient was noted to have apostoperative ileus. She did not tolerate NG tube feeds. A postpyloric Dobhoff was eventually placed and tube feeds wereinitiated. After transfer out of the intensive care unit , thepatient had difficulty with her Dobhoff catheter and eventuallybecame clogged and had to be removed. A speech and swallowevaluation was obtained. A bedside swallow was equivocal and afiberoptic swallow was done. She passed this with fine colorsper the speech and swallow team and they recommended that herdiet be advanced as tolerated. She was discharged torehabilitation on a regular diet.GU: In the Intensive Care Unit , she was massively resuscitatedinitially and then diuresed for virtually the remainder of herhospital course. An initial Lasix drip was then changed to IVLasix boluses. She was discharged on p.o. Lasix at an equivalentdose to her standing Lasix during her hospitalization. Acystogram was obtained prior to her discharge to rehab at thetime of dictation. The result of the cystogram are notavailable. If no extravasation is noted , her Foley catheter canbe removed at rehabilitation. If extravasation is noted , shewill need to undergo a repeat cystogram at some point in thefuture prior to removal of her Foley catheter.Heme: The patient was initially on subcu heparin due to concernfor bleeding. She was then started on a heparin drip and wasdiscovered that she had bilateral lower extremity partial DVTs.Her heparin drip was titrated to a PTT of 60 to 80 prior todischarge to rehab. Her heparin was discontinued and she wasstarted on Lovenox as a bridge to coumadinization. Her Coumadinbegan during the few days prior to her discharge when she wastolerating p.o. intake.ID: Due to the colovesical fistula , concern for some liveropacities on her original abdominal CTs , she was placed onbroad-spectrum antibiotics perioperatively. All antibiotics wereremoved on 1/22/05 .  She was noted to have a candidal UTI ,completed a five-day course of fluconazole. A small fever in theIntensive Care Unit warranted blood cultures being sent andrepeat blood cultures on 10/4/05 eventually noted agram-positive cocci. It was felt that this was likely due to acontaminant as the patient by that time had been afebrile forseveral days. However , she was started on vancomycin forgram-positive cocci , bacteremia. Her central line was removedand a new central line was placed and she was discharged to rehabon day 9 of 14 of IV vancomycin via her central line. After thecompletion of this course of therapy , her central line may beremoved at rehabilitation.Wound: Due to some drainage from abdominal wound due to her fatnecrosis , the lower portion of the wound was opened. There wasno evidence of active infection noted and a Vac sponge was placedinitially on 10/4/05 to facilitate the healing process. The Vacwas changed every three days during her stay. This most recentchange was on 10/30/05 .DISCHARGE CONDITION:Stable.DISPOSITION:Rehabilitation.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:As indicated on the discharge orders sheet.eScription document: 2-9082200 EMSDictated By: BLIEK , LAWERENCEAttending: FOLSON , TIMDictation ID 2664800D: 6/5/05T: 6/5/05

It is very difficult to elicit a clear story. Thepatient has had cough productive of variably colored sputum ( yellowto green to orange , without hemoptysis ) but it seems she mayhave had a similar cough for months. Similarly , she notes dysuriaand increased frequency which it seems has also been present forweeks to months. She is not short of breath and has no headache ,chest pain , hemoptysis , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,numbness , LE swelling , LE pain , rash. She does have some bumps onher abdominal wall which are painful-it sounds like these are adirect result of the enoxaprin she had been getting for a PE inOctober of this year.The ZH ER doctor spoke with Senz at the nursing home. She saidthat the patient had an x-ray two days ago which revealed pneumonia ,and her referral states that the pneumonia was in the left upperlobe and left lower lobe; the patient was started on Levaquin 500 mgp.o at that time. In the FMC emergency room , the patient was hydratedwith 3 liters of normal saline and her pulse still remains in the130s. She was given Levofloxacin 500 mg IV. The ER physician wasworried about a pulmonary embolus , did not do a chest CT herebecause of her elevated creatinine of 1.9. She was transferred tothe Chamvine Tionbradvar General Hospital for an MRA to rule out PE. In ER here , IJ central lineplaced ( CVP~20 ) and patient given 1L NS. Blood pressure systolicinitially 120s but decreased to 90s ( MAPS>70 ) , and norepinephrinestarted. The NE was discontinued promptly given BP improvementimmediately , and continuedSBP>100 PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic breast CA-bonescan which revealed widespread osseous metastasis , andCNS involvement on head CT , bone marrow bx with invasive disease ,status post brain radiotherapy 1/2 diabetes , PE 10/06 , tx withenoxaprin through 4/06 ( discontinued because of doubt over originaldx and significant pain at injection sites ) , hypertension , arthritis ,depression , bipolar disorder , asthma , high cholesterol , anemia , andobesity.ONC HISTORY: Pt presented with grade III , ER/PR/HER2-negative inOctober 2004. In January 2004 , she underwent right breast lumpectomywith pathology demonstrating 4.1 cm IDC , no LVI ,negative sentinel lymph nodes. She underwent partial breast radiationin January 2004 and deferred on adjuvant therapy. In August 2005 , shepresented with atypical chest wall pain and imaging showed bilateralpulmonary nodules , thoracic lymphadenopathy , and pleural effusionconsistent with metastatic disease. A bone scan showed widespread osseous metastatic disease and head CT demonstrated a CNSinvolvement. She was treated with whole brain radiotherapy in October2006 and with weekly Taxol. She continued through October2006. Restaging studies showed stable visceral disease butprogression of bony metastatic disease. Therefore on March , 2006 ,she initiated a second-line Navelbinetherapy. PHYSICALEXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.3po , pulse 112 regular ,BP 120/75 , respirations 18 , sO2=100% on ambient air.GENERAL APPEARANCE: Laying in bed , coughing paroxysms.

LLL unchanged from 8/27 , and LUL improved C/w knownmetastatic disease.ASSESSMENT: 59 year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer and ahistory of pulmonary embolus presenting with one week of fatigue ,lethargy , tachycardia and fever. History notable forproductive cough and dysuria , although the chronicity of these issuesis unclear. Now growing 1 bottle from WBH as well as NBH of GPC inclusters empirically on Vanco , now looks to be coagneg.Discussed with ID , would like to keep vanco PLAN:*Tachycardia: Most likely secondary to an infection , eitherpulmonary or urinary. With improvement in Cr PE CT was obtained whichwas negative.Stable. d/c ASA and statin as no role for long term riskreduction at this time.*Cough: Productive cough , yellow to green sputum. Seems to have beenpresent for months , and it is unclear how much this has changed inthe past week. May be chronic secondary to tumor , or mayrepresent acute infection. Aspiration plausible given mental status.The CT did not demonstrate any acute etiology for her symptoms.*Dysuria: Again , chronicity unclear. UA and urine culture at HNH notvery suggestive of UTI , but UA here with 25 wbc and LE+. Has been onlevofloxacin , so will treat until cultures return with ceftazidime( d/c 10/20 ). *Bacteremia: coag neg staph x2 , Vanc Sens , plan totreat via PICC w/Vancomycin x14days *Oncology: Discussion with Dr.Clusky , her primary oncologic fellow , who noted that from mydescription the patient does not sound much different from herbaseline state. She is mildly tachycardic at baseline ( although notto this degree ) , and has chronic productive cough anddysuria. 5. Renal: ARF , improving with IVF. Likely prerenalazotemia. 6.Heme: Chronic anemia. Given 1UPRBC in ER.Unfortuantely , the blood was given before hemolysis or iron studiessent. Would be indicated , especially in setting of markedly elevatedPT. Should be sent in future. I have called and addedon a peripheral manual blood smear. Last INR similarly elevated ( butI believe patient was on enoxaprin at that time ). Not on enoxaprinor warfarin now. May be dues to malnutrition , butconcerning for DIC or liver disease.Administered vitaminK. 7.Psych: Resumed home zoloft , restartgeodon prn. 8.Goals of care: Discussed with the patient andDr. Pinion . The patient expresses that she wants to be intubated orhave defibrillation if needed. Dr. Ellestad has discussed this numeroustimes with her , and will readdress.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:DISCHARGE CONDITION: StableTO DO/PLAN:f/u with primary oncologistcall oncologist or return to ed with any change in symptomsNo dictated summaryENTERED BY: FENCEROY , TAYLOR C. , M.D. ( NM201 ) 11/8/06 @ 11:03 AM****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******

She presented to the Rial Community Hospital onthe day of admission complaining of an umbilical bulge over thepast several weeks. This umbilical bulge had been increasingsomewhat in size , but had not bothered her and was alwaysreducible. However , over the preceding weekend it becameincarcerated and then became somewhat painful. It was notassociated with any nausea or vomiting and she reported that shewas having normal bowel movements even in the face of this problem.She presented initially to the Sey Al Skaez County Health Center and wasadmitted with the diagnosis of incarcerated umbilical hernia.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Coronary artery disease with a history of MI times two in thepast with a recent echocardiogram on 11/8 showing an EF of55-60%.2. History of DVT in 1970.3. Hypertension.4. Rheumatoid arthritis.5. Gout.6. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter on Coumadin.7. Adult onset diabetes mellitus.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:1. Status post appendectomy.2. Status post mitral valve replacement with St. Jude valve.3. Left hip fracture repair.4. Status post mitral valve commissurotomy in 1955.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 80 mg a day , sublingualnitroglycerin p.r.n. , Propafenone 225 mgt.i.d. , Lopressor 150 mg b.i.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg a day andMicronase 10 mg b.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg a daywith 2-1/2 mg every Sunday.ALLERGIES:: She is allergic to aspirin and penicillin.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is an extremely pleasant elderly womanin no acute distress. HEENT - showedextraocular movements intact. Pupils equally round and reactive tolight. NECK - supple. HEART - regular rhythm. LUNGS - clear.ABDOMEN - soft , nontender , nondistended with approximately 1.5 cmin diameter umbilical hernia to the left of her umbilicus. Thishernia was somewhat tender to palpation , but showed no overlyingerythema or evidence of necrosis. She had normal bowel sounds.EXTREMITIES - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. NEUROLOGIC - intact.Preoperative laboratory showed BUN of 35 , creatinine 1.3 ,hematocrit 42.0 , white count 6.8 , coagulation studies within normallimits.HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Peick was admitted to the Lum Hospital on the day of admission with thediagnosis of incarcerated umbilical hernia. Because of her historyof coumadinization for both her mitral valve as well as her atrialfibrillation it was felt that it would be necessary to hospitalizeher , hold her Coumadin and heparinize her until it was possible todo her surgery. However , upon arrival here her admission INR wasnoted to be subtherapeutic at 1.3 and she was , therefore ,immediately started on heparin. The Cardiology Service wasconsulted regarding her significant past cardiac history andrecommended an echocardiogram to be performed preoperatively. Thisecho was done on 9/6/98 demonstrating an EF of 55% with anabnormal subdural wall motion , trace areas of aortic insufficiencyand mildly increased right ventricular size and the artificialmitral valve was noted to be functioning well. The cardiology feltthat in the face of this largely unchanged echocardiogram thatshowed stable and should go to the operating room for repair ofumbilical hernia. On 7/1/98 the patient was taken to theoperating room and underwent umbilical hernia repair with primaryreapproximation of the fascia. The procedure was done without anycomplications. She was extubated and transferred in stablecondition to the postoperative recovery area and observed on thefloor. She was immediately restarted on her Coumadin as well asher heparin which she continued for the next three dayspostoperatively. The patient did quite well with gradual up in herINR to a greater than 2 level and she was discharged to home on4/23/98 on a regular dose.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q four hours p.r.n.headache , Estrogen cream topical which isapplied to her vagina because of her atrophic vaginitis.

Colonic polyps.6. Prostate adenocarcinoma.7. Pancreatic cancer , metastatic.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:Mr. Galle is a 67-year-old man with cardiac risk factorsincluding hypertension , hypercholesterolemia. His CAD historybegins one year ago when he began to experience resting jaw painresponsive to two to three sprays of nitroglycerin. On 5/10/05 ,he presented to Woodterra Raville Center with this pain and he was found tohave T wave inversion , ST depressions in V6 , V1 and aVL. At thatpoint , his cardiac markers peaked at troponin of 29.6. He wastaken to the catheterization lab where he was found to have a 90%RCA stenosis. He underwent angioplasty and bare metal stentplacement. After the catheterization , he had six weeks withoutpain but over the last two weeks he had begun to experienceincreasing jaw pain that was minimally responsive tonitroglycerin spray. He presented for elective recatheterizationon 1/4 the day of his admission and was found to have 70% LADlesion and a 40% proximal RCA lesion. A Cypher stent was placedin the LAD. He was started on Integrilin for 24 hours and sentto the CCU for aspirin desensitization. He has taken aspirin forheadaches in his teens and developed rashes. He had takenaspirin a few times in his 20s and 30s without any recalled sideeffects. However , he did take 12 years ago , a dose ofindomethacin and reportedly had to be inducted into a coma in thehospital for severe adverse reaction to the indomethacin. Hecannot elaborate further on what this reaction was. Therefore ,given the need to be on aspirin for his new Cypher stent , he wasadmitted to the CCU for a course of desensitization.PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS:Include Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily , Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. ,captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Imdur 90 mg q.a.m. and q.p.m. ,Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily , Creon six tablets p.o. daily , Lantus 4units subcutaneous q.h.s. , Humalog subcutaneous with meals , asneeded nitroglycerin sublingual tablets.ALLERGIES:Include aspirin , penicillin and NSAIDs which produce rash.SOCIAL HISTORY:No tobacco , alcohol or other drug use history. He lives with hiswife and performs clerical work and can perform activities ofdaily living without issue.FAMILY HISTORY:Mother had esophageal cancer , his father had renal cancer.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Temperature 96.9 , pulse 87 , blood pressure 130/60 , O2 saturation97% on room air. His exam was significant for being thin ,fatigued man with mild icterus , mildly bleeding gums. JVP at 11cm. III/VI harsh systolic murmur at the base. III/IV diastolicmurmur at the base. His lung exam was clear bilaterally. Hisabdomen was soft , nontender with two ventral hernias withoutissue. He was alert and oriented x3 and had mild 1+ edemabilaterally.LABORATORY VALUES:His white count was 5.4 , hematocrit 30.2 , platelets 251 , 000.Creatinine was 1.2 after catheterization. His INR was 1.3. CKwas 42 , troponin 0.12.PROCEDURES:Catheterization went without event with stenting of his LAD 70%lesion with Cypher stent.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiac. Mr. Celeste cardiac catheterization wentsmoothly with identified 70% mid proximal LAD lesion and proximal40% RCA lesion. A Cypher stent was placed in the LAD , and he wasstarted on Integrelin and sent to the CCU. His Plavix and Imdurwere continued as per his home dose. His beta-blocker and ACEinhibitor were held for anticipation of aspirin desensitization.He did not experience any further chest pain or jaw pain duringhis stay and was stable hemodynamically.2. Allergy. It was agreed that his aspirin should be takengiven that he now has a Cypher stent. Given his vague history ofpossible aspirin allergy and question of anaphylactic shockinduced by NSAIDs , it was decided to desensitize him to 81 mg ofaspirin. This was done as per protocol defined by AllergyConsult Service with doubling increments starting at 5 mg andgoing to 81 mg of aspirin over the course of two hours every 30minutes. Epinephrine and Benadryl were kept at bedside but werenot required because he had no adverse reaction to any of thedoses.DISPOSITION:The patient was discharged home in stable condition on all hishome medications as previously prescribed plus aspirin 81 mg eachday. He was instructed that it was important to take his aspirinevery day because if he missed a dose he may have an allergicreaction that his desensitization was designed to avoid.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. to be started one day afterdischarge.2. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily.4. Imdur 90 mg q.a.m. and q.p.m.5. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily.6.

White count 8.4 , hematocrit39.8 , platelet count 367 , 000. PT 12.1 , PTT 19.5. INR 1.0.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. Lofstrom is a 57-year-old female with apast medical history of hypertension ,diabetes mellitus , multinodular goiter , arthritis and questionablerecurrent bouts of generalized weakness who was admitted for newonset of right sided weakness ( three days prior to admission ) ,right leg numbness and weakness , right arm clumsiness followed bydysarthria.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. NEUROLOGY: The patient was felt to have a probable subcorticalstroke of the left hemisphere with preservation of the speechprocessing abilities with dense motor and sensory involvement.This was felt to potentially represent an MCA branch occlusion withincreased edema versus a large lacuna. In addition , given herhistory , the team was unable to rule out the possibility of anembolic event. Therefore , the patient was admitted and ruled outfor a myocardial infarction. Her CKs were 25 , 37 , 37 and 32. Shewas placed on a cardiac monitor with no evidence of arrhythmia.she was placed on subcu heparin and started on full dose aspirin325 milligrams p.o. q.d.In order to further work up the etiology for stroke , the patienthad an echocardiogram done which revealed evidence of concentricLVH with preserved systolic function , calculated ejection fractionof 55%. Other than nonspecific septal abnormality , there was noevidence of regional wall motion dysfunction. There were earlychanges of mitral annular calcification present , some increasedexcursion of the mitral leaflet , but this is associated with onlytrivial regurgitation. Trileaflet aortic valve withoutdysfunction. One plus tricuspid regurgitation. Peak doppler flowvelocity across the tricuspid valve reached 2.5 meters per secondconsistent with normal right heart systolic pressures. There wasno evidence of effusion. In addition , the patient underwentcarotid noninvasive studies which revealed no evidence ofhemodynamically significant disease in either carotid artery withthose arteries having minimal plaque and 1-25% stenosis. Inaddition , the patient had an MRI/MRA to further evaluate potentiallesions. On MRI there was a focal area of increased T2 signal inthe posterior limb of the left internal capsule , close the genu.This area demonstrated restricted diffusion on EPI diffusion ,weighted sequence. A similar smaller area of signal abnormalitywas noted in the left globus pallidus adjacent to the left internalcapsule abnormality. These areas represent subacute infarctions.The ventricles and sulci were minimally prominent , consistent withthe patient's age. There was no other signal abnormality noted.Major vascular flow voids were normal. There was no mass or masseffect. Three D , TOF MRN angiogram on the circle of Willis and itsmajor tributaries did not demonstrate any abnormality. Incidentalnote was made of a dominant right vertebral artery. The formalimpression revealed subacute infarcts involving the posterior limbof the internal capsule on the left as well as the left globuspallidus. Unremarkable MR angiogram on the circle of Willis.In addition , given the patient's history of polymyalgias , an ESRand C-reactive protein were obtained. The ESR was 46. TheC-reactive protein was 1.13. The stroke service was asked tocomment on the possibility of a vasculitic process. In addition ,the patient's primary rheumatologist was consulted as well. Thepatient's primary rheumatologist felt that the patient's stroke wasmost likely due to small vessel disease associated with diabetesand hypertension. He felt there was no evidence for a vasculitis.He therefore suggested to continue aspirin , but in higher doses toalleviate her left shoulder pain. The patient did not feel thatshe had any vasculitic process. They therefore recommendedcontinuing aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d. , checking a serumhomocystine which remains pending at the time of this dictation ,reviewing her carotid studies ( mentioned above ) , and continue withphysical therapy occupational therapy and speech therapy.PT and OT were consulted as well as Speech Therapy.In addition to continuing the patient on aspirin , continuing subcuheparin while the patient was immobile , the patient'santihypertensives were held in order to maintain a systolic bloodpressure between 140-160 and a diastolic blood pressure between85-90 for the first ten days following her stroke. For the firstfew days , the patient was kept in a lying position as much aspossible and her activity level was gradually increased to thepoint where she was participating in full PT/OT. At the time ofthis dictation , the patient's Norvasc continued to be held withexcellent control of her blood pressure between systolic of140-160. It should not be reinitiated until roughly ten days afterher stroke.The patient had relatively poor return of function during herhospital stay , but was felt to be a good candidate for potentialrehabilitation. Therefore when her medical issues were stable , shewas considered ready for transfer to a rehabilitation facility inan attempt to further improve her neurologic function. As notedpreviously , the patient's antihypertensives should be reinitiatedgradually with a goal systolic blood pressure between 140-160 witha diastolic blood pressure of 85-90 to be initiated roughly tendays from the time of her stroke ( presented on 8/17/98 ). As notedby the work up , the patient had no evidence of an embolic sourcefor her stroke and her carotid studies were unremarkable.2. RHEUMATOLOGIC: As noted , the patient has a long history ofdiffuse arthritic complaints. She had her sed rate and C-reactiveprotein checked. Rheumatology was consulted who felt that herstroke was not consistent with a vascular process. They didrecommend checking a urinalysis to check for red blood cells andcasts. Her urinalysis showed no protein , no blood , 0-2 red bloodcells , no casts. Only other recommendation was to continue aspirinand consider higher doses to alleviate left shoulder pain. Inaddition , recommended avoiding nonsteroidals while the patient wason aspirin.3. ENDOCRINE: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus andhad not taken her insulin for several days prior to admission. Thepatient was placed on her regular insulin schedule as well as asliding scale. The patient's blood sugar has ranged from the 150to the high 200s. As the patient's diet returns to baseline , shemay require adjustments of her NPH and regular insulin doses. Inaddition , the patient's Premarin was held during this admission andfurther therapy should be decided by the patient's follow upneurologist.4. FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The patient initiallyappeared somewhat dehydrated on admission and was thereforerehydrated with IV fluids. She had good resolution and returned tobaseline of her BUN and creatinine. She was eating well at thetime of discharge. Close observation was paid to her electrolytesincluding her potassium. Her electrolytes should be periodicallymonitored at least once a week at rehabilitation. She does have ahistory of hyperkalemia and should be watched carefully for this.5. SOCIAL WORK: The patient initially made a comment to theMedical Team that she had been abused by her husband. The socialworker was consulted and asked to see her regarding this issue ofspouse abuse. It is true that her husband had hit her in theforehead with a baseball bat in the past. He died several yearsago and no further abuse history could be elicited since his death.She currently has two supportive children.The patient was considered stable and ready for discharge to arehabilitation facility. When the date of her transfer is madeavailable , her discharge medications will be dictated along withfollow up.Dictated By: RODGER FALIS , M.D. MW19Attending: JUAN AMISANO , M.D. AI9  EB354/2097Batch: 4280 Index No. YTCBO390I D: 10/5/98T: 1/19/98

There is nohistory of steroid or steroid boluses or alcohol use.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Degenerative joint disease bilateral hands.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post varicose vein stripping andbilateral cataract surgery.MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg b.i.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mgq.d. , Voltaren 75 mg b.i.d. , Cimetidine 300 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Permatol 2.5 mg b.i.d. , and Levoxil 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese female with anantalgic gait on the right. Nolymphadenopathy. HEENT: Benign. She has dentures. Lungs clearto auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.Infrequent ectopic beats. Abdomen: Soft , nontender , nondistended.Extremities: The right lower extremity sensation and motor areintact. She has a 30 degree straight leg raise , 90 degrees offlexion , 10 degrees of internal rotation , 30 degrees of externalrotation , and 2+ dorsalis pedis pulse.LABORATORY DATA: X-rays demonstrated collapse of the right femoralhead consistent with osteonecrosis on the right.An old MRI scan also shows these osteonecrotic changes in the rightfemoral head.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on10/16/97 .  She underwent a right total hipreplacement. The details of this procedure can be seen in theoperative note. Postoperatively the patient was maintained onCoumadin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. She had a PCA forpain control and this was quite adequate. She received one unit ofautologous blood for a postoperative hematocrit of 29 onpostoperative day #1. She did not require any further transfusionsand the last hematocrit prior to discharge was 35.4.Postoperatively the patient developed numerous paroxysmal episodesof supraventricular tachycardia. A medicine consult was obtainedand it was recommended that she be placed on Verapamil 80 mg t.i.d.This appeared to work at first; however , it was unable to controlher tachycardia , particularly with any activity. The patient wasthen placed on Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. and the Verapamil wasdiscontinued. The patient did quite well with this and herparoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia resolved. She was able toprogress with physical therapy without any episodes of increase inheart rate. The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarctionand her CK and MB remained negative. Her Hemovac was removed onpostoperative day #1. She had her wound inspected on postoperativeday #2 and thereafter her incision remained clean , dry , and intactwithout any evidence of erythema or drainage. As mentionedpreviously the patient was maintained on Coumadin for deep venousthrombosis prophylaxis. She worked with physical therapy on adaily basis and progressed well once her heart rate was undercontrol.DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was tolerating aregular diet. She was working daily with physicaltherapy and progressing well. She had resolution of her paroxysmalsupraventricular tachycardia with heart rate down into the 80s and90s on Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. She had a stable hematocrit andremained on Coumadin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Herincision appeared clean , dry , and intact without any evidence ofinfection. She had lower extremity non-invasive tests , as well asa hip film prior to discharge. She had no evidence of deep venousthrombosis on her lower extremity non-invasive tests. The patientwill be discharged to rehabilitation. FOLLOWUP: The patient willfollow-up with Dr. Locke in six weeks. She is to cal for anappointment. She will remain on Coumadin for deep venousthrombosis prophylaxis for a period of six weeks. She shouldremain on her Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. and , if room permits , herCaptopril can be discontinued and Lopressor used as her sole agentfor heart rate and blood pressure control.

He is 13 years' status postbioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and also has a history ofafib with diastolic heart failure and a permanent pacemaker , onCoumadin therapy. Ten days prior to admission to the Josesanderstlake Medical ,he had extraction of all his remaining teeth. Following that , hehad a gradual onset of malaise , shortness of breath , and generalweakness. He was admitted to Sonbyrd Lanor Community Hospital following afall to the ground where he was found to be febrile withleukocytosis and there was a question of left lower lobeinfiltrate. Blood cultures at Kimau Hospital Of quickly returned positivewith Staphylococcus aureus. PE was performed , which was negativefor vegetation , but the patient's oxygen requirement increasedand his blood pressure seemed to be dropping , and thus he wastransferred to Lo Memorial Hospital for further workup and management.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Afib , hypertension , diastolic dysfunction ,echo in 1999 with moderate concentric LVH and EF of 65% , rightheart catheterization in 2000 showed elevated right heart fillingpressures and wedge pressure which increased with exercise ,cardiac output of 4.4 , status post 27-mm bioprosthetic AVR andascending two grafts in 1992 , afib with diastolic heart failure ,left bundle-branch block , permanent pacemaker , hypothyroidism ,type II diabetes , obesity , distant cholecystectomy , AAA , statuspost repair ( ? ) , thrombocytopenia , gout , prostate cancer , statuspost hormone therapy , and diabetes mellitus.MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission were lisinopril 5 q.o.d. ,allopurinol 100 b.i.d. , glyburide 6.25 q. day , levothyroxine 100 ,Zoloft 50 , Protonix 40 , Lasix 60 , and Coumadin 2.5.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his daughter who is verysupportive and his wife in Ver He is retired. Nohistory of tobacco or alcohol.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , the patient appeared ill. He wasslightly lethargic. Slightly uncomfortable. His oxygen was 96%on 4 L of oxygen. Heart rate 70s. Blood pressure in the low80s. Temperature 99.1. HEENT: Notable for slightly elevatedJVP. His lungs showed decreased breath sounds at the left andright base with rales up to one-third on the right side. His PMIwas nondisplaced. He was in an irregular S1 , normal S2 with norubs or gallops. There was a 1/6 systolic murmur at the base.JVP was approximately 15 cm. Pulses were 2+ and equalbilaterally. No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. He was orientedto person , time , and generally to place , but not to date. Hisremainder of neurological exam was grossly intact.LABS ON ADMISSION: Notable for a potassium of 4.3 , BUN 36 ,creatinine 2.5 , white count 8.1 , hematocrit 39.4 , CK andtroponins were negative , and INR 2.0. Chest x-ray on admissionshowed a question of a left lower lobe infiltrate by report. Italso revealed a left pleural effusion with a question ofinfiltrate and a right pleural effusion. EKG showed afib , leftaxis deviation , and left bundle-branch block. Echo done at thebedside shows an EF of approximately 45% to 50% without grossregional wall motion abnormalities with some paradoxical motionconsistent with left bundle-branch block. There is no obviousvegetation , but this was a limited study.HOSPITAL COURSE AND PLAN PER SYSTEM:Shortly after admission to the Cardiology Team , the patientcontinued to have borderline blood pressures. His blood culturesagain grew out MSSA and his oxygen requirement increased and hewas transferred to the CCU for central monitoring and furthersupportive care. In the CCU , he was continued on antibiotics.Initially , the patient was on vancomycin for concern for MRSA.When his cultures came back , he was switched over initially toAncef and gentamicin and then on consultation with ID tonafcillin. The patient briefly required pressors , but then afterreceiving IV fluids and continued antibiotics , his blood pressurenormalized to approximately 90 to 100.Remainder of hospital course by system:1. ID: The patient had repeated Gram-positive bacteremia withMSSA up until the January , 2005 , after which time his dailycultures have shown no growth to date. As above , the patientwill be maintained on nafcillin , gentamicin was discontinued , andthe patient was started in rifampin on 5/24/05 , both antibioticswhich he should continue for at least 4 to 6 weeks. Daily bloodcultures do not need to be resumed unless the patient has atemperature at which point he should be cultured. He has beenafebrile for the last 3 to 4 days prior to discharge. We did notdo a TEE as the patient is likely not a surgical candidate and hewas felt to be at very high risk of intubation , should he becomeseptic again or spike temperatures this would be reconsidered.In the interim , the patient should continue with antibiotics andfollow up with ID Clinic in approximately 3 to 4 weeks.2. Cardiac:Ischemia: The patient had a very small troponin leak of 0.15 onMarch , 2005 , otherwise his troponins were negative. This waslikely demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis. After thepatient's blood pressure improved , we started him on a low-dosebeta-blocker , which he should continue. We held his ACE as hisblood pressure was generally about 90 to 100. If his bloodpressure improves slightly , we would recommend restarting the ACEas an outpatient.Pump: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure andan EF of 40%. He was slightly fluid overloaded after transferback from the CCU in the setting of getting fluids for sepsis.He was diuresed intermittently very gently with IV Lasix at 20 ,which seemed to improve the patient's shortness of breath andwheezing , which correlated with the patient being more wet. Hewas restarted on his own Lasix of 60 , for which he shouldcontinue and also recommend having the patient receive dailyweight checks and to adjust Lasix in order to maintain dailyweight.Rhythm: The patient is afib with left bundle-branch blockoccasionally and RVR at Ening Health , which seemed tocorrelate with fevers. But , he had a normal rate while inhouseespecially while on beta-blocker. He has an AICD , which seemedto be working fine inhouse as well as a pacemaker.2. Pulmonary: The patient has maintained on 2 to 3 liters atwhich he is saturating at 93% to a 100%. He will likely needoxygen for a few more days as some of his remaining fluid istaken off. Please check oxygen saturations daily and titrate offoxygen as he is able to.3. Renal: The patient is with chronic renal insufficiency ,baseline of 1.7. His range in the hospital was 1.7 to 2.5.Pheno was checked which was approximate 33% and he did not haveany urine Eos or caths to suggest allergic interstitial nephritisor ATN. Please repeat a creatinine in one week to ensure that itremains stable. I suspect that as some of his fluid is takenoff , his flow will be better and his creatinine will be slightlyimproved.4. Endo: The patient is with diabetes. He was initially onPortland protocol while in the Intensive Care Unit. On thefloor , he was maintained on NPH and a Regular Insulin slidingscale. He should continue on NPH and this should be titrated inorder to maximize blood sugar control , so he should continue on aRegular Insulin sliding scale. Once the patient is ready fordischarge to home , he should be switched back to his oralhypoglycemics.5. Heme: We held the patient's Coumadin or anticoagulation asit is contraindicated in the setting of endocarditis. Now thathis sepsis seems to resolve , the patient should be restarted onhis Coumadin in approximately 3 to 4 days after discharge with agoal of an INR of 2 to 3.6. Psyche: The patient remained generally oriented to personand situation to hospital while inhouse , but occasionally slidedown especially in the setting of having fevers. He wascontinued on his home Zoloft and we added a small dose ofZyprexa , which seemed to also help. The patient benefits fromregular reorientation which we suggest continuing.7. Prophylaxis: The patient is to receive heparin t.i.d. andPPI for DVT and ulcer prophylaxis respectively.8. Access: The patient now has a PIC line , which is in placeand can be used for IV antibiotics.DISCHARGE DIET: His discharge diet is a 2-g sodium ADA 1800 to2000 calories per day , low saturated fat , low cholesterol , andmechanical soft.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: His discharge medications are as follows;Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n. pain or temperature , aspirin 81mg daily , Colace 100 b.i.d. , Lasix 60 p.o. daily , heparin 5000units subcutaneous t.i.d. , NPH 16 units q.p.m. , Regular insulinsliding scale a.c. and h.s. , Levoxyl 100 mcg daily , rifampin 300mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zoloft 50 p.o. daily , Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 mgnebs q.4h. p.r.n. wheezing , nafcillin 2 g IV q. 4h , Zyprexa 2.5mg p.o. nightly , miconazole 2% powder topical b.i.d. to rash ,Advair Diskus 250/50 one puff inhaled b.i.d. , Duoneb q. 6h.p.r.n. wheezing , Protonix 40 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 mg p.o.daily , and allopurinol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.TO DO: The patient should follow up with his cardiologist Dr.Gebauer and his PCP Dr. Lowell Blass once discharged from short-termrehab. In addition , the patient should be seen by ID Clinic inapproximately 3 weeks to discuss remaining antibiotic therapy.In addition , the patient should have a set of labs drawn inapproximately 5 to 7 days to recheck his creatinine. Pleasecheck blood cultures if the patient has a temperature. Pleaseassess the NPH regimen as above. Please restart his Coumadin at2.5 mg in 3 days with a goal INR of 2.3.eScription document: 9-8494853 ISFocus transcriptionistsCC: Blake A.

The patient is followed by Dr.Strubbe of the Hufi General Hospital , and by Dr. Torri of theOnas Medical Center cardiology team. The patient recalls flu-like symptoms inearly April 1996 , but otherwise , was well until two days agowhen he noted the onset of right sided , sharp chest pain which waswell localized to the right chest , worse with breathing and chestmovement. The patient denied any similarity to previous anginalpain , which he noted is more substernal in nature and has notoccurred in months. The patient was concerned that the pain wascardiac and took two sublingual nitroglycerin without relief , andtherefore , presented to the Swebrothers Hospital EmergencyRoom. The patient denied any nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis ,shortness of breath , abdominal pain , melena , constipation ,diarrhea , and hemoptysis , at the time of admission. He noteshistory of chronic venostasis disease in his lower extremities withbilateral decreased sensation and episodes of neuropathy pain whichhas not changed recently.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for: 1.

HEENT examination revealedmoist mucous membranes without lesions. Pupils were equal , round ,and reactive to light. Extraocular muscles were intact. Neck hadno LAD or JVD. Lungs had crackles present with egophony and E to Achange over the right low lateral lung field , otherwise , clear toauscultation bilaterally. Heart had an irregular rhythm with aregular rate. There was a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at theright upper sternal border and left lower sternal border. Therewas normal S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4. Abdomen was soft , nontender ,and nondistended with positive bowel sounds. Extremities revealed1+ bilateral pitting edema with bilateral changes of chronicvenostasis , 1+ pedal pulses on the left , but left foot slightlycool to touch. There was no palpable pulse in the right lowerextremity , but good capillary refill and warm. Neurologicalexamination revealed cranial nerves II-XII were intact bilaterally.Motor was intact bilaterally. Sensory was intact to light touchwith decrease in sensory to light touch bilateral lowerextremities. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ bilaterally.LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count was 21.12 , hematocrit38.8 , and platelets 191. INR was 2.1 , PTT 42.3.Sodium was 136 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 98 , bicarbonate 25 , BUN 16 ,creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 279. Admission EKG was significant foratrial fibrillation at 76 beats per minute with evidence for coldleft bundle branch block. Chest x-ray was significant for rightmiddle lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor foradministration of intravenous antibiotics. Thepatient did well overnight. In the a.m. of 4/5/97 , the patienthad an episode of hypoxia with increased requirement for oxygen andultimately required 100% face mask for 93% O2 saturation. Thepatient denied any anginal chest pain , nausea , vomiting , orincreased shortness of breath. A stat EKG revealed no changes.Stat chest x-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary edema. Thisresponded well to IV Lasix. However , the patient continued torequire increased amounts of oxygen over the next two days whereinhe had further episodes of pulmonary edema requiring p.r.n. IVLasix. During this time , blood cultures from the time of admissiongrew out Pneumococcus times two which were sensitive to penicillin.The patient's broad coverage antibiotics were then changed to IVpenicillin. An echocardiogram obtained on 4/5/97 revealed a highnormal left ventricular size with mild concentric hypertrophy ,hypokinesis with inferior septum , and inferior posterior region ,ejection fraction 45% , normal RV size and function , left atrialenlargement , mild to moderate mitral regurgitation , and no aorticstenosis or insufficiency. The patient was initiated on Captoprilwhich was then increased titrating with the patient's bloodpressure over his hospital stay. The patient , during his hospitalcourse , was also noted to have increased blood sugars to the 450range. Therefore , he was started on a sliding scale insulinregimen.The patient improved with regards to his hypoxia and , on themorning of 6/15/97 , he was breathing room air with an O2saturation of 93%. His lung examination was significant for onlyrare rhonchi on the right side. Chest x-ray of 3/4/97 revealedimprovement of his right lung pneumonia with persistence ofbilateral effusions consistent with his episodes of pulmonaryedema. Fingerstick glucose was 164 reflecting an overallimprovement and decreased need for sliding scale insulin. Thepatient was felt to be well and ready for discharge.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Coumadin 2.5 mgone p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday , and Friday ,and two p.o. q.

Since his last interventionin 10/24 for re-stenting of his LCx , pt had been pain free , able to walkabout 1/2 mile without difficulty. On the morning of admission pt wokeup with sharp chest pain associated with diaphoresis and tingling downhis left arm. However , the pain was different from the pressure he hadfelt from his previous admissions that were positive for stenosis. Painwas described as sharp 9/10 that improved after taking his second dose ofntg. The diaphoresis and arm symptoms resolved concurrently with thechest pain. He received a third dose of ntg from the EMS and brought toED.Of note , one week ago patient was struck in the center of his chest byteenagers "horsing around" next to him. The impact was severe enough tocause him to fall to the ground.

It was unclear if the nausea was related to ischemia or thedose of dilaudid he received in the ED. However there were no ECGchanges during his nausea. Altogether the nausea lasted forapproximately 10 minutes. He remained pain free during the night withwhat he described as some slight pressure over his chest. His chest istender at baseline ever since his CABG and it was difficult to assesswhether the pain was MSK or cardiac in nature. He sometimes felt it wasdifferent from when he first presented with an MI , and at other times hedescribes the pain as being related to movement and to the kick to thechest that he received 2 weeks earlier ( see HPI ). Overnight on HD#1patient did not require any more NTG doses , remained hemodynamicallystable , and three sets of enzymes were negative for MI. Pt had severaladmissions in the past where he presented with chest pain and underwentcatheterizations , some of which revealed restenosis and some of whichwere negative. Given his presentation was very atypical it was decided todo a stress PET the next day to assess ischemia and then re-evaluateplan. He was kept on his home regimen of cardiac medications in additionto lovenox 100 mg SC for ACS. On HD#2 when moving from his chair to thebed he began to complain of 2/10 chest pressure that he says felt alittle different than the pain when palpating his chest. Again therewere no ECG changes. He underwent a stress PET which was negative forischemia. Given his presentation with a clearly negative study it wasmost likely that his symptoms were MSK in origin.2 ) DM2Patient's home regimen of oral hypoglycemic agents were held and he wastreated with basal insulin and a sliding scale.3 ) FENNPO for stress PET , K/Mg scales4 ) PPXPatient was on lovenox for ACS , PPI5 ) Full Code=========================ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: - Please take your home medications as you were doing.

In 1981 ,the patient was admitted to Mimo Gnura Medical Center withsyncope secondary to aortic stenosis. A porcine AVR was performedat that time. He had an unremarkable course until 1/25/90 , whenechocardiogram performed at REH showed an AV gradient of64 mm ofmercury , mild to moderate MR , LVH , and normal function. A blowingdiastolic murmur was noted on physical exam at that time. On5/16/91 , the patient underwent an ETT that was nondiagnostic duetobaseline EKG abnormalities. However , he had no substernal chestpain after 12 minutes and 20 seconds. Around the end of October1991 , the patient noted increasing fatigue , increased temperature ,and some upper respiratory symptoms including cough and sorethroat. He claims that his sore throat lasted for nearly a monththen went away for one week only to return again for nearly onemonth. He had been treated with amoxicillin without improvement.One week prior to admission , he had persistent symptoms with acough with poor sputum production but the sputum that was producedwas yellow-green in color. He was treated with erythromycin in asingle dose before hospitalization. Also , one week prior toadmission , he noted some left chest pain without radiation that istypical of his chest pain syndrome which had been previouslydiagnosed. On the day of admission , the patient noted increasedpersistent elevation in his temperature and a chest x-ray showedquestionable left lingular infiltrate that led to his admission.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noteable for history of adult onsetdiabetes , previously treated with insulin but now diet controlled.Status post porcine AVR secondary to rheumatic heart disease.Atypical chest pain syndrome. Depression. MEDICATIONS: Onadmission included erythromycin , Motrin and imipramine. ALLERGIES:NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. SOCIAL HISTORY: Remarkable forsignificant past smoking history , past alcohol use , job as apainter's rigger.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed an obese white malewhose appearance was appropriate for his agein moderate distress. Blood pressure was 160/90. Heart rate 80.Temperature 101.1. Respiratory rate of 14. Skin revealedblanching macular rash confined largely to the trunk withoutsplinter hemorrhages , Janeway's nodes or Osler's nodes. Cardiacexam revealed normal sinus rhythm , III/VI holosystolic murmur atthe left sternal border , II/VI diastolic murmur at the left sternalborder and a II/VI crescendo/decrescendo murmur at the apex withextension to the axilla. Lungs revealed scattered rhonchi and fewrales especially in the left lung field. Extremities were withoutcyanosis , clubbing or edema.LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a glucose of 172. Whiteblood cell count 7.7. Hematocrit 41.2. Plateletcount 403 , 000. Previous work-up at AH showed an ESR of 24.Urinalysis had 1+ protein , 1+ glucose , 1-3 white cells , 1-3 redcells , trace bacteria and 2-5 hyaline casts. EKG revealed normalsinus rhythm at 96 , intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40 with axis of -30degrees. There was LVH with strain. Chest x-ray showed aquestionable lingular infiltrate that was read as such by oneradiologist but this was not confirmed by a second radiologist.There was no sign of congestive heart failure on chest x-ray.HOSPITAL COURSE: When the patient was admitted , he was initiallytreated as if his presenting symptoms were due toa left lingular pneumonia despite his lack of elevated white count.However , it was felt that endocarditis a small though realpossibility in this gentleman with AVR. Therefore , he wasoriginally treated with ampicillin , 2 grams IV q six hours;gentamicin , 100 mg IV q eight hours; and erythromycin , 1 gram IV qsix hours to cover atypical bacteria including Legionella. Priorto administering antibiotics , three blood cultures were obtained atDH in addition to the two previously obtained at  TP .  Sputumsample was also sent for gram stain and C&S. All blood culturesremained negative throughout the hospitalization. Sputum cultureshowed only normal flora. When the second radiologist read thechest x-ray as being inconsistent with lingular pneumonia , a moreaggressive search for possible endocarditis was undertaken. Anechocardiogram was performed on 8/19 that showed an aortic valvewith 40 mm gradient , 2-3+ AI , 1+ MR , mild LVF and no regional wallmotion abnormalities. There was no evidence of vegetation on theecho. Side by side comparison of this echocardiogram with theechocardiogram from 5/25 done at LGMC showed no significantinterval change. An Infectious Disease consult was sought and itwas felt by these consultants that endocarditis was an unlikelydiagnosis given the lack of change in echocardiogram and lack ofadditional signs of SBE. It was ultimately felt that the patient'sshortness of breath and elevated temperature were due to bronchitisand he was switched to po Bactrim to continue a ten day course oftherapy. Although the initial goal of his hospitalization was tokeep him hospitalized until cardiac catheterization and valvereplacement could be performed , the patient's personal situationmade it unfeasible to keep him in the hospital for a longer periodof time than absolutely necessary. Furthermore , there werequestions about whether cardiac catheterization and AVR should beperformed in someone being treated for presumed acute bronchitisand whether his very poor oral hygiene and dental work can becorrected prior to surgery. For these reasons , Dr. SagredoinCardiology was consulted as well as Dr. Sturman in VWH Medicine andboth concurred that the patient could be discharged with closefollow-up by his primary care physician , Dr. Peltier . His conditionon discharge was stable.DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Bactrim DS , oneb.i.d. times seven days; imipramine , 50 mg po q h.s.;Colace , 100 mg t.i.d.; Nystatin , 5 cc swish and spit q.i.d.;Alupent , two puffs q six hours.MZ944/9851NICK SCHAIN , M.D. SR0 D: 05/21/91Batch: 8081 Report: R6700J45 T: 3/22/91Dictated By: ISAIAH G.

Her systolic blood pressure came up to 100 withoutintervention , but she was sent to Ster Valley General Hospital ER for further evaluation. In the ER , her head andspine CT was negative , her chest x-ray showed right effusion andher cardiac enzymes were elevated with a troponin of 0.50. Shewas given Lovenox , Zofran , and aspirin and admitted for furthermanagement.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , diabetes ,cerebrovascular accidents , cortical blindness , hypertension ,anemia , monoclonal gammopathy , left upper extremitythrombophlebitis.MEDICATIONS AT NURSING HOME: Colace , Nexium , Senna , oxycodonep.r.n. , aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , Lipitor , and NPH insulin.ALLERGIES: Penicillin , sulfa and propoxyphene.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.4 , blood pressure110/80 , pulse 92 , respirations 95% on room air. The patient wasalert and oriented x1 , she was just alert and oriented to person.Her neck vein showed a JVP less than 8 cm. Her chest was clearto auscultation but decreased breath sounds on her right basewere noted. She had regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen was softwith bowel sounds , nontender. Extremities remarkable for 2+pitting edema , which were symmetric.REMARKABLE LABS ON ADMISSION: BUN 67 , creatinine 2.6 , whiteblood cell count 6.2 , hematocrit 44 , platelets 136 , BNP 880 ,troponin 0.5.PERTINENT RADIOLOGIC STUDIES DURING ADMISSION: CT scan to rulepulmonary embolus on 3/25/05 was negative. Multiple chestx-rays showed unchanged right pleural effusion , which was smalland not amenable for thoracentesis. ECG showed normal sinusrhythm at 90 beats per minutes , low voltage , incomplete rightbundle-branch block , left axis deviation , Q-waves inferior andanterior , no ST depressions or elevations. This was nosignificant change from EKG that was done on 2/3/05 .  Lowerextremity ultrasound on 10/21/05 showed left popliteal veinthrombosis.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Cardiovascular: The patient had troponin elevations duringthis hospitalization , the highest being 0.8. This was initiallythought to be consistent with a non ST elevation. However ,patient had no EKG changes. It was also noted that the patienthad similar elevations of her troponin and was recently admittedto an outside hospital. She was initially continued on cardiacregimen of aspirin , Plavix , and Lopressor. On 10/21/05 , thepatient had an episode of hypotension with systolic bloodpressure in the 30s of unknown etiology. She was given IVfluids , dexamethasone 4 mg and one dose of gentamicin andvancomycin for presumed sepsis. A bedside echo that was doneshowed severe tricuspid regurgitation , diastolic dysfunction andejection fraction of 40% and pulmonary pressures in the 60s.There were wall motion abnormalities that were noted. Thepatient was given additional doses of intravenous fluids and herblood pressures came back to 120s-130s/60s-70s. At this point ,the etiology of her low blood pressure was still unknown. On2/16 , patient was again unresponsive with low blood pressure andno pulse. Code was called and the patient awoke after few chestcompressions was done and had a blood pressure of 130s/70s. Shewas subsequently seen by Dr. Eugenio Krucker , cardiologist at Camp Memorial Hospital , who thought her overall picture andechocardiogram was consistent with cardiac amyloidosis. Thepatient was thought to have autonomic insufficiency secondary toamyloid neuropathy and a fixed cardiac output with restrictiveheart. Serum protein analysis subsequently revealed apredominance of IgG light chains with elevation of both kappa andlambda light change , which are suggestive but not confirmatory oftype AL amyloidosis. A fat pad biopsy was also done , resultswere pending at discharge. Further blood samples were sent toPerli Medical Center for furtheranalysis. The patient will obtain results via her primary carephysician , Dr. Emanuel Chuh . Of note , the patient had nofurther hypotensive episodes prior to discharge.2. Hematology: The patient was noted to have a low plateletcount of 136 , 000 at admission. It was thought that this couldbe due to possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but the hepantibody was negative. On 4/30/05 , lower extremity ultrasounddone after first episode of being unresponsive was positive forleft popliteal vein thrombosis. The patient was started onheparin intravenous according to protocol. On 10/12/05 , thepatient had nosebleeds and hematuria and her PTT was noted to begreater than 150. Heparin was stopped until the PTT was between60 and 80. The bleeding stopped. She was continued on heparinand her PTT was maintained between 60 and 80. She was laterswitched to Lovenox and Coumadin maintaining her INR between 2and 3. Lovenox was discontinued and on discharge the patient wasjust on Coumadin. Her discharge INR was 2.4.3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency withbaseline creatinine of 2.5. A Foley was placed at admission forpatient comfort. She consistently had low urine output duringher hospitalization , averaging about 300-400 cc of urine a dayeven after IV fluid administration. She had two days ofhematuria secondary to anticoagulation that resolved aftercopious irrigation of the Foley. Her creatinine at discharge was2.7. There were no acute renal issues.4. Pulmonary: The patient required oxygen throughout her stayto keep her saturations above 95%. She had a few episodes ofshortness of breath , which spontaneously resolved. She was givena few doses of IV Lasix and this helped a little with hershortness of breath , but her chest x-ray remained unchanged fromadmission.5. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. She hadnormal fingersticks during her hospitalization. She was on atight glycemic control with a regular insulin sliding scale.6. Neuro: The patient was on aspirin and Plavix initially givenher history of CVAs and cortical blindness , but on discharge , shewas on Coumadin for anticoagulation. The patient also had alidocaine patch that was applied for 12 hours every day andoxycodone was used p.r.n. pain.7. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient received IVfluid boluses during hypotensive episodes. Electrolytes werefollowed and repeated accordingly. Nutrition was consulted andshe was placed on a soft pureed diet with a 2-L fluidrestriction , no concentrated sweets. She was also given Neprosupplements given her renal function.8. Line: The patient initially had an EJ line , then a femoralline for access as peripheral access was difficult to obtain.She then had a PICC line placed on 1/22/05 for access.9. Disposition: There was a family meeting on 1/22/05 duringwhich the patient's poor prognosis was discussed with Ms. Vernon B Corippo , the patient's daughter. The family emphasized that hercode status was DNR/DNI and they were comfortable with thedischarge back to Ge Er Derd .

PHC Cardiology felt that this chestpain was not related to her heart or ischemic cause and left it upto the primary provider , Dr. Dorset , to arrange for an out-patientexercise stress test if felt necessary. Most likely , the chestpain represented some type of gastroesophageal reflux disease andthe patient was restarted on Axid. Another issue was question ofnew neurologic deficits although the original head CT showed noevidence of stroke. The stroke may have been too early to detectleaving diagnosis of either a new cerebrovascular accident , amanifestation of a seizure , or a conversion reaction secondary toher borderline personality. Her primary deficit remained theslowing of speech without actual slurring of speech and without anydeficits in understanding or expression. A lumbar puncture wasdone on the second day of hospitalization with a mildly elevatedprotein in the sixties and a glucose in the 120 range. Cell countwas low not consistent with infection. A cardiac echo was alsodone which showed normal left ventricular function without anysegmantal wall motion abnormalities , there was a question of leftventricular hypertrophy , and carotid dopplers were done whichshowed no significant disease in the internal carotid arteries ,however , there was a mild left internal carotid artery plaque.Patient's neurologic status remained stable during herhospitalization. She was started on Aspirin on admission. Aftermuch discussion with NMH Neurology as well as with Dr. Talboti , itwas felt that the patient could be followed as an out-patient. Itis recommended that the patient have Neurology follow-up next week ,had a repeat CT of the head done to see whether ther is a newinfarct , and also an EEG was recommended by the NeurologyConsultation Servicer here for a question of seizures. Patientwill have home Occupational , Physical , and Speech Therapy providedthrough Dishmution .  Another issue was hypercalcemia. Patient had anelevated calcium on admission. Patient was guaiac negative withoutany mass lesions. Patient's chest X-Ray was also read as clearwithout any masses. Patient did have a cursory breast examinationwithout any evidence of a breast mass and has had mammograms in thepast without any evidence of malignancy. The etiology of theelevated calcium was unclear although leading diagnoses includeprimary hyperparathyroidism , prolonged immobilization , or lying inbed with some leeching of calcium versus a possible malignancy.Patient should have her calcium followed as an out-patient. Shedid have a PTH level drawn during this admission , the results werenot back at the time of discharge , however , this level should bechecked upon her next visit. Patient is now ready for dischargehome.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Acebutolol 400 mg p.o.b.i.d. , NPH Insulin 30 units subcutaneously q.a.m. ,Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ecotrin one tablet p.o. q.d. , and Fioricetone to two tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. for headache.

STATUS POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTIONS X 2.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old womanwith a history of breast cancer andcardiomyopathy , secondary to Adriamycin , as well as other medicalproblems , with left hip pain that has been a chronic issue andwhich prompted her to present to Onver HospitalEmergency Department on January , 2000. In the EmergencyDepartment , the patient became progressively lethargic and anarterial blood gas there revealed hypoventilation , presumedsecondary to obesity and the patient's congestive heart failure.Blood sugar in the Emergency Department was found to be 46 and thepatient was given D50 , but eventually required a D10 drip tomaintain her sugars. The patient was also placed on BIPAP tomaintain O2 saturations. It seemed that the combination ofcongestive heart failure and poor baseline respiration , secondaryto body habitus , led to this acute worsening. The patient wasstabilized in the Emergency Department and sent to the floor onBIPAP.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history includedAdriamycin induced cardiomyopathy ,hypertension , diabetes , sarcoid left breast cancer ,hypercholesterolemia , deep venous thromboses , OSA , and coronaryartery disease , status post myocardial infarctions x 2.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patientwas on Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,Dulcolax 5-10 mg p.o. q. day p.r.n. , digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day ,Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Robitussin DM10 ml q. 4 hours p.r.n. , hydralazine 25 mg p.o. q.i.d. , insulin NPH30 mg subcutaneously b.i.d. , Zestril 40 mg p.o. q. day , Maalox ,Milk and Magnesia , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual p.r.n. , Sennatablets p.r.n. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day , Zocor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,oxycontin 10 mg p.o. q. 12 hours , oxycodone 5-10 mg q. 6 hoursp.r.n. pain , and Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q. day.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's social history revealed that shelives alone with family help for daily chores.The patient denied a history of tobacco or alcohol use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination revealed the patient tobe an obese woman with vital signs revealingtemperature 96 , pulse 93 , blood pressure 115/60 , respiratory rate24 , and saturations 78% on 1.5 liters of oxygen , with 97% on 4liters of oxygen. HEENT examination showed no jugular venousdistention. The neck was thick. There was no lymphadenopathy andno carotid bruits. Extraocular movements were intact. The pupilswere equal , round and reactive to light. Cardiovascularexamination showed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur , rub ,or gallop. The lungs showed good breath sounds bilaterally , andfew crackles in both bases anteriorly. The abdomen wasnon-distended and non-tender , obese , firm , and with hypoactivebowel sounds. The extremities showed generalized anasarca.Neurological examination showed the patient to be alert andresponsive at the time of examination. Cranial nerves II-XII wereintact.LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission revealed sodium 140 ,potassium 5.7 , chloride 99 , bicarb 34 , BUN 32 ,creatinine 1.3 , glucose 40 , white count 8.2 , hematocrit 39.3 ,platelets 241 , ALT 32 , AST 65 , LDH 717 , CK 436 , with an MB fractionof 5.4 , troponin I 0.22 , total bilirubin 0.6 , direct bilirubin 0.1 ,alkaline phosphatase 381 , digoxin 1.8 , calcium 9.4 , and albumin4.1. Urine tox screen was negative. An INR was 2.5 , PTT 32.0 , andD-dimer greater than 1000. Arterial blood gas before BIPAP showedpH 7.41 , pCO2 63 , and pO2 66 on 2 liters of oxygen by nasalcannula. A portable chest x-ray showed moderate to severepulmonary edema , bilateral hilar fullness , right greater than left ,and cardiomegaly. Abdominal ultrasound was negative for ascites.A KUB showed free air , non-specific bowel gas pattern , and noobstruction. A urinalysis showed no protein , 2+ blood , 5-10 redblood cells , and 1+ squamous epithelial cells. Electrocardiogramshowed normal sinus rhythm in the 80s , low voltage , with no changefrom previous studies.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unitfor diuresis and continued BIPAP. However , thepatient did not tolerate BIPAP , but diuresed well , in fact , toowell , to intravenous boluses of Lasix , with urine output of 7liters negative in one day , on May , followed by ventilatoryfailure on May , with bicarb greater than assay. The patientwas transferred to the CCU for worsening respiratory acidosis andnot tolerating BIPAP. The patient was intubated at that time. Thepatient began spiking temperatures on May , as well , and wasstarted on a regimen of levofloxacin and clindamycin on Septemberfor the question of aspiration pneumonia. On May , aSwan-Ganz catheter was floated with pulmonary capillary wedgepressures of 25 and the patient was started on afterload reductionwith Isordil , hydralazine , and Diamox for metabolic alkalosis ,which was thought to be contributing to her worsening respiratoryacidosis. On July , ceftazidime was started for Pseudomonas ,which was found in the patient's sputum. Over the next severaldays , the patient had an increased peak requirement to oxygenatesatisfactorily. On November , vancomycin was started for coagnegative Staph , which was cultured from an arterial line , andlevofloxacin was discontinued. On May , the antibiotics werechanged per recommendation of the Infectious Disease consultationto ceftazidime and Flagyl for Pseudomonas in the sputum culture ,and the question of C. diff. Vancomycin and clindamycin werediscontinued at that time. On February , amikacin was added fordouble coverage for advanced associated pneumonia with Pseudomonas.Subsequently , the patient slowly improved and it became easier tooxygenate her , with a decreasing fever curve. A chest CT scan onJanuary , was consistent with bilateral pneumonia , as well. OnJanuary , the patient was taken off the vent to a trach collar ,following her tracheostomy and PEG procedure , which she toleratedwell on May .Other issues in the patient's hospitalization have includedhypernatremia , thought secondary to the patient's receiving largeamounts of Lasix and having no access to free water. This wastreated with free water boluses. The patient also had prerenalazotemia , which was improving at the time of discharge , as well ascoronary artery disease , which was not an issue , and fluidoverload , secondary to cardiomyopathy , which was much improved.The patient's course was also complicated by acute renal failure ,with creatinines rising as high as 2.6 before falling to 1.5 on theday prior to discharge. The patient's chest CT scan also showedsignificant lymphadenopathy , which was noted prior , and was thoughtto be secondary to sarcoid , which was recurrent CA , at this point ,given that there was no biopsy data. Also , a transthoracicechocardiogram showed a thickened mitral valve , which may beunchanged from prior studies , and the clinical suspicion forendocarditis was fairly low. However , if further positive bloodcultures should arise , this might require further work-up. Thepatient's course was also complicated by anemia , which has requiredseveral blood transfusions while the has been here. The patienthas had several episodes of bleeding and oozing from variousprocedure sites , as well as some guaiac positive stool. Thepatient's reticulocyte was found to be 4.9% , while the hematocritat that point , on February , was 25.7%. Given her reticulocyteindex of 1.40 , which was inappropriately low , the patient was ,therefore , started on erythropoietin , as well as ironsupplementation. The patient was also supplemented with tubefeeds , as well as Promod protein supplements , during the course ofher admission. In terms of the patient's endocrine issues , thepatient was treated with insulin , including varying doses ofregular insulin , NPH , and subcutaneously , as well as insulin dripsat times. While in the hospital , Physical Therapy began to see thepatient prior to discharge and the patient was able to transferfrom bed to chair with assistance.While in the hospital , the patient underwent tracheostomy and PEGprocedure on May , 2000.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patientwas on Diamox 250 mg per G-tube b.i.d. ,ASA 325 mg p.o. q. day , amikacin 600 mg IV q. 24 hours , naturaltears two drops OU t.i.d. , ceftazidime 1000 mg IV q. 8 hours ,erythropoietin 5000 units subcutaneously three times per week ,ferrous sulfate 300 mg per G-tube t.i.d. , folate 1 mg per G-tube q.day , NPH insulin 105 units subcutaneously b.i.d. , regular insulinsliding scale q.a.c. and h.s. , metoprolol 50 mg per G-tube q.i.d. ,nitroglycerin 0.4 mg one tablet sublingual q. five minutes x 3p.r.n. chest pain , nystatin suspension 5 ml p.o. q.i.d. with theinstructions that a swab may be used if the patient is unable toswish and swallow , omeprazole 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chlorideimmediate release p.o. sliding scale , Senna tablets two tabs p.o.b.i.d. , therapeutic multivitamin one tab p.o. q. day , or 5 ml perG-tube q. day , simvastatin 10 mg per G-tube q.h.s. , Atroventnebulizer 0.5 mg inhaled q.i.d. , Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously q.12 hours with the instructions to check heparin factor 10A levelsafter the third dose on May , potassium chronic sliding scaleq. day , and Flovent 220 mg inhaled b.i.d. , with four puffs b.i.d.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient wasin stable condition.DISPOSITION: The patient was to be transferred to the PulmonaryRehabilitation program at the U Of .FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up care should include monitoring the patient'santicoagulation with checking heparin factor 10A levelsfor her Lovenox after the third dose on May .  The patientmay also be transitioned to Coumadin once a satisfactoryanticoagulation with Lovenox has been achieved. The patient shouldalso follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Ronnie G Sheldon at Park as soon as possible while at Park Cean Hamppo orafter she is discharged from there.Dictated By: GERARD CRIMIN , M.D. CH01Attending: DANILO T.

ABDOMEN: Soft and non-tender.EXTREMITIES: Pulses palpable in the femoral , carotid and radialpulses , right dorsalis pedis graft pulse was 2+ palpable with 1+dorsalis pedis dopplerable pulses on the left. The great toe had amedial wet ulcer as well as a right plantar ulcer that was dry withan eschar of about 2 cm. The left leg had 2+ pitting edema withincreased asymmetry to the knee and the left great toe showed somefibrinous exudate without any pus.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was placed on ampicillin ,levofloxacin and Flagyl. He was planned to gothe operating room the next day for a left great toe debridement.Preoperatively , he was seen by Cardiology who recommended that wedouble his dose of simvastatin to 20 mg and increase the Lopressorto 25 mg q.i.d. and otherwise , he was cleared for surgery. OnJuly , 2002 , the patient was taken to the operating room for aleft foot debridement and left great toe amputation. This was doneunder spinal anesthesia. The patient tolerated the procedure welland on postoperative day number one , he had a VAC sponge placed tothe wound. He tolerated having the VAC sponge on and was able toambulate heel weight bearing only with the VAC sponge.Cardiology followed the patient and recommended that we change himto atenolol and add Tricor as an anticholesterol drug.The Diabetes Management Service was also consulted to help with thepatient's fingersticks and we increased his NPH as well as addedregular insulin in the AM and PM.On March , 2002 , the VAC sponge was taken down and wet to drydressing was placed over it. At this time , it was felt that thewound was not ready for a skin graft yet and the plan was todischarge him to rehabilitation for wet to dry dressing changesuntil the wound was ready for skin grafts.Thus , the patient is discharged to rehabilitation in stablecondition to continue wet to dry dressing changes as well as tocontinue a course of vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl for twomore weeks.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol 50mg p.o. q. day , Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d. , insulin NPH human 45 units q.

EMS was called and foundthat he had an O2 saturation of 80%; it increased to 97% on 100%nonrebreather. EKG on admission showed new left bundle-branchblock , but cath lab declined to intervene because he wastachycardic at that time. It was felt to be secondary to demand.He was hypotensive in the ED requiring fluids. Subclavian linewas placed.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD. He has 3-vessel coronary arterydisease , status post CABG x1 in 1999 , SVG to RCA. He had anNSTEMI in 1/22 with Cypher stent to 70% proximal LAD and Pixelstent to 70% ostial D1.

Echo in September 2005showed an LVEF of 35% with a kinesis of septum , inferior wall ,apical lateral segment and mechanical mitral valve. His EKG inthe MICU showed sinus at a rate of 76. When his rate was faster ,he showed a left bundle-branch block.COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. ID: There was a question of multilobar pneumonia based onhis recent admission for pneumonia and the appearance of hischest x-ray. He was initially on empiric ceftriaxone ,azithromycin , and vancomycin in the MICU. We discontinued thevancomycin. Blood cultures were clear. He weaned from oxygen ,and his chest x-ray cleared within 1 to 2 days. So , it was feltthat he had more of the component of CHF exacerbation. Hecompleted a short 7-day course of azithromycin.2. Cardiovascular:I. Ischemia: He has extensive CAD and showed an elevated CK ,troponin , and a new left bundle branch in the setting ofhypotension. This was felt to be a demand ischemia. His enzymes wereelevated with his troponin remaining elevated at 5 , but the MB haddecreased from 18 to 2 rapidly. The cardiology consultants feltthat this was demand ischemia as the left bundle-branch block wasrate dependent and recommended continued medical management. Heis already on therapeutic-dose Lovenox for his history of CVA.II. Pump: He initially had hypertension in the unit. Thisresolved and he appeared euvolemic on his home dose of 20 mg ofLasix daily. A repeat echo revealed no changes.III. Rhythm: As mentioned above , he exhibited a new leftbundle-branch block in the setting of tachycardia but decreasedrate.3. Heme: Initially had bleeding from his left subclavian sitein the setting of his anticoagulation; it resolved. Spoke withthe vascular wervice who recommended holding one dose of Lovenox when theline was removed. This was done , and the line was removedsuccessfully without any bleeding.4. Renal: He has chronic renal insufficiency. His creatinineremained at baseline of 1.2 to 1.5.5. Neuro: He has a history of multiple CVAs. We kept him onhis treatment-dose Lovenox other than being held for 1 dose toremove the line. He has seizure disorder. He is on Keppra. Hehas a history of sundowning and was placed on Zyprexa briefly butthis was weaned.6. Endo: At home , Mr. Vanzie was on oral medications.

Also diabetes mellitus typeII complicated by retinopathy , nephropathy and question neuropathy.History of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia as well whopresented to Dr. Bouie clinic on May , 2001 withprogressive increasing dyspnea , increasing abdominal girth andweight gain over the past few months.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus x 20 years , chronic renalinsufficiency with the last creatinine inJanuary of 3.5 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of30% in October of 2000 , coronary artery disease status postmyocardial infarction , October 2000 question f silent myocardialinfarction x 2 , history of hyperlipidemia.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day ,Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg p.o. q day , toprol XL50 mg p.o. q day , insulin 70/30 65/45 , Actos 45 q p.m , Avapro 300mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , sublingual nitroglycerinp.r.n..PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.1 , blood pressure 116/70 , pulse 88 ,primary care physician of 18. The patient appearedto be in no acute distress. Jugular venous pressure approximately13 cm water. LUNGS: Faint bibasilar rales. CARDIAC:Tachycardia , regular rhythm without murmurs. ABDOMEN: Positive ,normal active bowel sounds. Obese , distended and nontender.EXTREMITIES: 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse , 2-3 plus edemabilaterally to the knees.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: It was felt that given notesof thyroid dysfunction , his history wasconsistent with fluid overload. His jugular venous pressure waselevated and he had 3plus pitting edema to the knees withoutsignificant rales on chest exam. He was aggressively diuresed withdoses of Lasix 200 mg b.i.d.

Abdominalultrasound showed no ascites despite extremely distended abdomenand right renal cyst x 2. Follow up abdominal CT also showed therewas no mass or ascites and his distended abdomen was likely due toadipose tissue. Diuresis was limited by acute and chronic renalfailure and oliguria. Diuresis was held from May , 2001.Right heart catheterization on February , 2001 showed mildlyelevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and moderately elevatedright ventricular pressures. Dopamine was started on June ,2001 to aid with renal perfusion and diuresis and he was thenweaned off of that on July , 2001. His Lasix was stopped onJuly , 2001 and he auto-diuresed until the time of dischargewith stable blood pressure.

Both ulcers have been nonhealing andcyclically formed dark eschars and superficial scabs which havebeen treated with lotion as recommended by his podiatrist. Fiveto six months ago , he traveled to Oonperfin Rd and spend some time inhot tubs and Jacuzzi's but his ulcers continued to form escharswithout healing completely and also episodically becameerythematous and painful with involvement of the forefoot. Eachepisode usually resolved with foot elevation and rest. On8/29/05 , after long walks , he noticed that the right fourth toeturned to a dark purple color , was malodorous. He had pain withweightbearing and was obliged to heel walk. Over the nextseveral days , the forefoot became erythematosus and swollen aswell. He denied any fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , cough ,headache , although he had an episode of malaise and chills thatlasted three days several weeks prior to his admission. Hisappetite had been stable. He had not had any recent weightchange. Functionally , he was doing well. Ambulation was limitedonly by foot pain. He denied claudication , chest pressure ,dyspnea on exertion. He would sleep on one pillow at night withhead flat. He denied lightheadedness or any presyncopalepisodes. On 5/30/05 , he presented to H Medical Center forworkup of his painful forefoot and toe ulcers. He was afebrilewith vital signs stable. His right fourth toe was described asblackened with clear demarcation at the metatarsal junction , andeschar was noted on the right first toe. He is white blood cellcount at that stage was 12.7. Plain films were notable forsuspicious swelling about the fourth toe with evidence of gasnoted within the soft tissues of the medial aspect of the fourthtoe in the proximal interphalangeal joint. He went on to haveABIs that were 0.32 on the right side and 0.43 on the left sideand PVRs were normal at 5 level only. He also underwent acardiac workup that was notable for SPECT/MIBI that showed areversible defect involving the basal , mid and apical segments ofthe anterior wall consistent with myocardial ischemia. An echoshowed an ejection fraction of 45% and possible septalhypokinesis. Given the positive stress test and a positive needfor cardiac cath , he was transferred to T.bafnashstin Hospital for further management. He did not feel that would havechange in appearance since 1/25 although the pain had increasingintensity. He denied any sensory or motor deficits , but he hadpain whenever he moved his toes or put any weight.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Rheumatoid arthritis since 1980s that was untreated , type IIdiabetes mellitus since 1990s that was untreated , multiple bonyinjuries to his right foot , and a football accident as ateenager.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:Bilateral mastoidectomies in 1970s and 1980s , status post penilesurgery at childhood , status post sebaceous cyst removal in 2004.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:None.ALLERGIES:NKDA.SOCIAL HISTORY:One to three packs per day for 40 years , quit in 1980 , alcoholicuntil 1993 but had been sober attending AA since then.

HEENT: No JVP , no carotidbruits. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear toauscultation bilaterally. Birthmark on right upper back.Abdomen: Mildly distended , soft , nontender , no pulsatile masses.Bilateral lower extremity skin hallus with normal color andtemperature down to feet. Right forefoot was erythematous andedematous and warm with no fluctuance or crepitus. His plantarsurface was tender to palpation immediately beneath the fourthmetatarsal. His right fourth toe was necrotic and malodorouswith no purulent discharge. His anteromedial aspect of his rightgreat toe had a 0.5 cm round ulcer with dark eschar center anddesiccated edges with mild erythema and induration around it.Dorsiflexion was 5/5 and plantar flexion 4-/5 and limited bypain. He had full strength on the left side , normal sensationthroughout both feet. Pulses: Right carotid 2+ femoraldopplerable , DP dopplerable , PT dopplerable. Left carotid 2+femoral , 1+ DP , none PT dopplerable. Bedside ABIs: Right side0.43 , left side 0.51. He was admitted with diagnosis of amultilevel arterial insufficiency bilaterally and need for fourthtoe amputation impossible for debridement followed by angio forpossible revascularization.PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS:7/23/05: Attending surgeon , Leif Pinke , M.D. Openamputation of right fourth toe.8/17/05: Attending surgeon , Yong Weinrich , M.D. Coronaryartery bypass grafting x4 with saphenous vein graft to acutemarginal distal PDA , left internal mammary artery to the LAD , Yleft radial artery from LIMA to the ramus intermedius to theposterior left ventricular branch of the circumflex.7/23/05: Left to right femoral to femoral artery bypass usingan 8 mm Dacron graft.9/26/05: Attending surgeon , Tyree Denten , M.D. Rightfemoropopliteal bypass grafting and amputation of the right thirdand fifth toe.HOSPITAL COURSE:Mr. Bessard underwent amputation of his fourth toe on the rightside after his admission. He tolerated his procedure well. Afew days later , he underwent the previously mentioned coronaryartery bypass grafting; please refer to the previously dictatedsummary , dictation ID 8626234 for details. After his coronarybypass grafting , he underwent a femoral-femoral bypass graftingwith debridement of his right toe amputations site. After hisprocedure , he had a weak dorsal pedis , a questionable posteriortibial and normal popliteal signal on Doppler but none of hispulses were palpable. His femoral-femoral graft was easilypalpable on his abdomen. Due to his poor vascularization of hisright lower extremity , he underwent a femoropopliteal bypassgrafting on the right with a nonreversed saphenous vein graftingfrom the ipsilateral leg and amputation of his right and fifthtoe and closure of his lateral foot. He tolerated this procedurewell. The rest of his hospital course was complicated by aworsening of the left lower extremity perfusion. His left footwas slightly cooler than his right and his Doppler signalsfainted. An initial mottle appearance of his left lowerextremity improved with time. On 4/8 , his wounds were dry ,clean and intact. He had a palpable femoral-femoral graft anddopplerable left PT and DP pulses with monophasic signal. Bothhis PT and DP on the right are dopplerable as well with biphasicsignal. The same day , his Foley catheter was removed and hestarted mobilizing with heel weightbearing on the right and withhelp of physical therapy and the nursing personnel he iscurrently actively screened for rehabilitation.His discharge would be complete.

His K atthat time was 6.7. Creatinine was 6.1. His white count on10/14/2006 was 13.1 , 43.9 , and 309 , 000 , to complete a CBC. INRwas 1.The impression at the time of presentation was a 53-year-oldmale with multiple medical problems including coronary arterydisease status post recent revascularization in October of 2006 ,peripheral vascular disease , renal transplant status postfailure , now on hemodialysis , diabetes , hypertension , andhypothyroidism who presented with a left hip fracture and worsening of aprevious R distal tib/fib fx.HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the orthopedic surgeryservice and a preoperative evaluation was begun. On hospital day three ,he suffered a non-ST segment elevation MI requiring urgent cardiaccatheterization. His EF at that time was noted to be 65%. Left heartcatheterization revealed a single-vessel coronary artery disease involving hisleft circumflex with evidence of restenosis , and an angioplasty wasperformed. The patient was transferred back to the floor hemodynamicallystable. He continued to undergo dialysis on his Tuesday , Thursday ,Saturday schedule from the day of his catheterization until 10/16/2006 when hewas taken to the operating room for open reduction and internal fixation ofhis left intertrochanteric hip fracture. For a complete summary ,please refer to the operative note. His right tibial injury wasmanaged conservatively initially with splinting. On 10/20/2006 ,the patient returned to the operating room where he underwent arevision of his fixation of his right lower extremity withremoval of deep hardware and intramedullary rodding of his distaltibia fracture. A VAC was placed across the lower part of theincision. On 9/17/2006 , the VAC was changed on the floor andplaced on suction and was noted to be oozing steadily with aeventual EBL of about 1 L within several hours. His systolic bloodpressures also droped into the 80s to 90s along with symptoms ofdiaphoresis. Mr. Legacy was subsequently transferred to the 7D ICU formanagement of significant bleeding from his open wound , relative tachycardia ,hypotension , and diaphoresis , concerning for hemorrhage shock.The patient at that time was on Plavix , aspirin , and Lovenox , andit was thought that this combination certainly led to his oozingduring the VAC change. The patient was transfused several unitsof blood after hematocrit dropped from 28 to 19 on the day oftransfer. The patient was transferred back to the floor instable condition within several days. The patient continued to receivedialysis Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday during this time as theorthopedic surgery service continued wet-to-dry dressings of hisright lower extremity wound , which was open inferiorly. On1/6/2006 , the Aland Memorial Cardiology Service was againconsulted regarding the safety of discontinuing the patient'sPlavix , aspirin , and/or Lovenox prior to taking the patient backto the operating room. The service determined that his Plavixcould be stopped safely prior to surgery but should be startedpostoperatively. The patient was continued with daily wet-to-drydressings until 10/10/2006 when he was taken back to theoperating room for medialization of his right ankle. His Plavixhad been discontinued on 6/18/2006 and was restarted onpostoperative day one. The patient continued to receive dialysisduring this time , which he tolerated well. His subcutaneousheparin was restarted on 9/25/2006 .  However , the patient beganto ooze from his injection sites and his right lower extremitywound and the subcutaneous heparin was subsequently discontinued.Thus , the patient is maintained at the current time on aspirinand Plavix.Currently , by systems:Neurologic: The patient is receiving 30 mg of methadone q.8h.for pain as well as Dilaudid 0.2 to 0.4 q.3h. p.r.n. andoxycodone 20 mg p.o. q.2h. p.r.n. pain. He is alert and orientedx3 and is neurologically intact with the exception of decreasedsensation in his right lower extremity. Cardiovascularly , he hasbeen hemodynamically stable although his systolics often in the90s after dialysis. He is being continued on an aspirin 325 mgas well as Lopressor 12.5 mg q.i.d. , Imdur 60 mg daily , andPlavix 75 mg daily. He has prolonged QT ranging from 400 to 500and his frequent PVCs noted on telemetry. However , he has beenasymptomatic since his episode of hypotension requiringreadmission to the ICU.Respiratory: The patient has been stable on room air sincetransfer from the ICU and denies any pulmonary symptoms. GI , thepatient has had decreased p.o. intake and nutrition consultationwas ordered. Nutrition has been following the patientrecommending frappes and Boost , which the patient has been takingminimally. The patient has been having bowel movements and hisabdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended.GU: The patient is followed by the renal service for dialysis onTuesday , Thursday , and Saturday. Currently on PhosLo 667 mg p.o.t.i.d. , Nephrocaps , Caltrate. His sevelamer iscurrently held. The patient makes minimal amounts of urine inaddition to his dialysis sessions.ID: The patient has been maintained on vancomycin 1 g Tuesday ,Thursday , Saturday after hemodialysis. He has been afebrile forthe past week. His current white count is 8.6. Hematologically ,as mentioned previously , the patient presented on aspirin andPlavix and Lovenox was added. However , due to his episode ofbleeding requiring ICU admission , there was concern regardingover-anticoagulation. However , the three agents were continuedand the patient stabilized. Per the cardiology service , Plavixwas discontinued approximately one week preoperatively andrestarted one day postoperatively. Subcutaneous heparin wasadded back to his regimen on postop day two. However , he beganoozing from his injection sites in his right lower extremity andthus the subcutaneous heparin was discontinued. The patient'shematocrit is currently 31.6.Endocrine wise , the patient has been continued on his home doseof prednisone which is 10 mg daily , he has also been continued onNPH and NovoLog which have been titrated per recommendations fromthe diabetes service. His wound on the right lower extremity isgranulating appropriately although there are areas of ecchymosisand skin thickening and darkening around the incision. Thepatient is currently receiving b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressings of theright lower extremity. His right hip surgery incisions areclean , dry , and intact with no signs of infection.eScription document: 7-2787555 HFFocusDictated By: EXTON , RICKYAttending: BECKMEYER , MURRAYDictation ID 5723597D: 1/23/06T: 1/23/06

At thattime , he was performing strenuous work in his bakery and began tosuffer from 4/10 chest pain , "heaviness" , and discomfort. The paindid not radiate. He denies dizziness , shortness of breath ,palpitations , and diaphoresis. The patient took one sublingualnitroglycerin and sat down with resolution of pain in approximatelyfive minutes. The patient then returned to work. Several hourslater , while again performing strenuous work , the patient suffereda similar episode of chest pain and heaviness which he rates as a2/10. The patient sat down and , this time , the pain resolvedwithout sublingual nitroglycerin in approximately three minutes.The patient was disconcerted by these multiple events and went tothe Skaggsmiddrish Hospital Emergency Room for further work up. Whilesitting comfortably in the Emergency Room at Nantsi Memorial Hospital , thepatient suffered a similar event of chest pain and tightness , whichhe reports to be approximately 1.5/10. He took one sublingualnitroglycerin with resolution of his symptoms in approximately fiveminutes. The patient was transferred to Slandchor Hospital Medical Center at that point. One hour later , in Sa Hospital Emergency Room , the patient suffered a similar episode ofchest pain and tightness , this time rated at 1/10 , with resolutionof pain in approximately one minute , not requiring sublingualnitroglycerin. The patient reported , at that time , that his lifehad been very stressful , and that he had been working very hard inhis bakery. Review of symptoms is consistent with above and ,otherwise , noncontributory.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease diagnosed in 1994with catheterization performed in April1994. There was 80% mid circumflex , 70% distal , 95% mid right , 50%distal left anterior descending occlusions. Posterobasilarhypokinesia with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. 2.Hypertension times greater than 30 years. 3. Hypercholesterolemia.4. Hepatitis in 1991 , believed to be of a viral type with completeresolution of symptoms and no sequela. 5. An exercise tolerancetest in February 1996 that showed 2 mm ST segment depression in theinferior and lateral leads. The exercise tolerance test proceededwithout chest pain.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy in the distant past.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.a.m. 2.Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. 3. Atenolol100 mg p.o. q.day. 4. Diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5. Entericcoated aspirin 325 mg q.day.ALLERGIES: Shellfish causes a rash.FAMILY HISTORY: Mother had hypertension , grandmother with coronaryartery disease. There is no history of diabetesmellitus or cancer.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies current tobacco use. Hereports a 40 pack year history , quitting fiveyears ago. The patient denies alcohol use. The patient lives athome with wife. They have no children. The patient reports thathe is now on a low cholesterol diet , has lost 100 lb over the lasttwo years , and was successfully walking four to five miles a daywithout chest pain or other symptoms until the day prior toadmission.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile. His bloodpressure was 132/84 , heart rate 62 , and aroom air saturation of 96%. Generally , Mr. Mcalister was analert , well appearing man in no apparent distress. He was eager toanswer our questions. Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throatexamination was significant only for exanthema under the right eye.The patient's neck was supple with full range of motion and nolymphadenopathy. There were bilateral carotid bruits. Carotidpulses were 2+. The patient had jugular venous distention of 6 cmwith the head of the bed elevated at 15 degrees. Lungs were clearto auscultation bilaterally. Heart examination was significant fornormal S1 and S2 , and a II/VI systolic ejection murmur that washeard best at the lower left sternal border , although it wasaudible at the right sternal border , left mid axillary line , andappeared to radiate to the carotids. The abdominal examination wasbenign. The patient's extremities were clear of cyanosis ,clubbing , or edema. The patient had 2+ symmetrical pulsesthroughout. The patient was guaiac negative by report was normaltone. Neurologic examination was nonfocal and significant for thepatient being alert and oriented times three , with a motorexamination showing 5/5 strength throughout. Sensory examinationwas intact to light touch. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact. Thepatient had deep tendon reflexes that were 2+ throughout.LABORATORY DATA: The patient was found to have normalelectrolytes. White count was 6.3 and hematocrit41.2. CPK obtained at Storgwi Hospital was 148 and serialCPKs obtained at Scc Side Medical Center were 81 , 114 ,115 , respectively. No MB fraction was done. At Ins Medical Center , the patient had an EKG taken that was significant fornormal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute with intervals of169/93/402 with no Q waves , no ST changes. This was consistentwith an EKG from September , 1996. An EKG obtained at Han Rutl Medical Center showed normal sinus rhythm at 64 beats per minutewith intervals of 172/100/412 with one PVC captured. However ,there were no Q waves and no ST changes.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was begun on heparin 1 , 000 units perhour IV after an initial 5 , 000 units IV bolus.The patient consistently maintained a PTT in the range of 60-80seconds. The patient underwent a catheterization the day followingadmission which demonstrated 80% occlusion of the ramus branch ,100% occlusion of the left obtuse marginal branch number one , and a100% occlusion of the patient's right coronary artery. It wasdecided that the patient would be a candidate for both conventionalPTCA to attempt to repair the left circumflex coronary artery.However , the patient's severe coronary artery disease lead theinterventional radiologists to consider the patient for a laserwire type of PTCA in the event that PTCA was not successful. Asthe laser wire PTCA was not available for several days , it wasdecided to have Mr. Lienhard remain as an inpatient on heparin tomaintain a PTT of 60-80 while awaiting the laser wire guided PTCA.Three days following admission , while awaiting PTCA , the patienthad one episode of chest pain that he reports resolved in less thanthree minutes with one sublingual nitroglycerin tablet. Thepatient denied shortness of breath , palpitations , or diaphoresis.Since that time , the patient remained totally stable with nofurther events of chest pain and no EKG changes noted. The patientwas begun on 250 mg of Ticlid b.i.d. two days prior to hiscatheterization procedure.On May , 1996 , five days after admission , the patientsuccessfully underwent PTCA of his left circumflex artery which hadpreviously had a 100% stenosis. The patient had two stents placedin the left circumflex artery , leaving a 0% residual lesion. Thepatient tolerated the procedure well , returned to the floor. Thecatheterization sheaths were removed six hours after the procedure.Examination the following morning revealed no further bleeding , nohematoma , and good pulses distally , as well as a warm and dry leftlower extremity. As the patient tolerated the procedure well andhad no further complications , it was decided that the patient couldbe discharged the day following his catheterization , maintained on250 mg of Ticlid b.i.d.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone25 mg p.o. q.a.m. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o.q.h.s. , atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.day , diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. , andenteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.day.DISCHARGE CONDITION: Mr. Ruesswick will be discharged in stablecondition following his PTCA from the daybefore. The patient will be discharged to home.FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Wilburn Ducceschi ,his outside hospital cardiologist , in one to two weeks.We suspect that Mr. Danco will be able to return to his normalactivities of daily living without any further disability.Dictated By: BEAU KAMNAAttending: AHMED J.

She is currently on Xeloda with excellent response;per Dr. Cagan , her outpatient oncologist , she has virtually noevidence of metastatic disease on CT. Over the past few months ,the patient has had chronic problems with nausea and decreasedappetite. This has become especially acute over the past week ,and as a result , her chemotherapy is now on hold. She has alsohad some worsening diarrhea , for which she was prescribedImodium , but because of ongoing issues with compliance , it wasfelt that she was not taking enough at home. During anoutpatient visit with her cardiologist , her blood pressure wasnoted to be 90/50 , so her dose of atenolol and Lasix wasdecreased. Of note , the patient is status post a recentadmission to MH for digoxin toxicity , so this medication is nowalso on hold. Of note , the patient is not currently on Coumadindespite a history of atrial fibrillation due to a history of GIbleeding , possible interactions with her chemotherapy regimen ,and ongoing issues with medication compliance. The patient wasadmitted for rehydration , management of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea ,and control of her pain and other symptoms.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:Nausea/vomiting x several months , diarrhea approximately sixtimes per day , worsening over the past week with green liquidstool , no blood in stool or vomit , no abdominal pain , no urinarysymptoms.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Metastatic breast cancer ( diagnosed in 1999 , status postlumpectomy and lymph node dissection , formerly on numerouschemotherapy regimens including Adriamycin/cytoxan , Taxol ,Taxotere/Herceptin , gemcitabine ) , atrialfibrillation/supraventricular tachycardia , hypertension ,hypercholesterolemia , cholecystitis , diabetes mellitus ,esophagitis.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:Lasix 20 mg q.d. , aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Xeloda 1500 mg b.i.d.

She has nohistory of tobacco or alcohol use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Vital signs: Temperature 97.9 , pulse 101 , BP 80/66 , respiratoryrate 16 , O2 sat 99% on room air.General: Alert , Spanish-speaking , no acute distress.HEENT: PERRL , EOMI , poor dentition , OP clear.Neck: No LAD , FROM , supple.Chest: CTAB.CV: Irregularly irregular , S1 , S2 , no murmurs/rubs/gallops.Abdomen: Soft , distended , mild tenderness to palpation in thelower quadrants bilaterally , slightly tympanitic , normoactivebowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly.Extremities: Warm/well perfused , trace DP/PT pulses , noclubbing/cyanosis/edema , ulcer on left large toe , severelycracked and dry skin on hands and feet.Neuro: Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact , 5/5 strengththroughout.LABORATORY VALUES:Significant for creatinine 1.3 , glucose 137 , WBC 9.6 with 28polys and 29 bands , hematocrit 38.1 , total protein 5.2 , albumin2.0 , ALT 41 , AST 18 , alk phos 61 , total bilirubin 2.5.An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular responseat approximately 140 beats/minute. No ST or T wave changes.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. GI: Colitis: Given the patient's persistent and chronicnausea , vomiting , and diarrhea , there was significant concern forsmall bowel obstruction on admission. However , a KUB andabdominal CT were both negative for small bowel obstruction. Shewas originally kept n.p.o. for bowel rest , and a nasogastric tubewas placed with significant drainage. Stool studies were sentincluding C. difficile , ova and parasites , cecal leukocytes , andShigella/salmonella/Yersinia/campylobacter studies , all of whichwere negative. Because of the concerning nature of the patient'ssymptoms , surgery consult was called , however they felt that herproblems were likely nonsurgical in nature. CTs performed twodays and five days after admission showed identical findings ofright-sided colitis. They remained largely unchanged.Nevertheless , the patient experienced continued nausea andvomiting and also continued diarrhea throughout this time. Onceher nasogastric tube output decreased significantly ,approximately one week after admission , the tube was removed andthe patient was started on p.o. , and her diet was advanced astolerated. From that point on , the patient had no nausea orvomiting , and she is currently tolerating a full diet.Nevertheless , she continues to have mild diarrhea , now twoepisodes per day as compared to6 to 8 episodes per day prior toadmission. In the end , the workup for the underlying cause ofher nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea has been negative. It istherefore our suspicion that her symptoms are most likelysecondary to toxicity from her chemotherapy medication , Xeloda.Of note , the patient also has other signs of Xeloda toxicity ,including possible hepatotoxicity ( see below ) as well as severecracking and drying of the skin on her hands and feet.2. Hepatitis: A CT performed on admission to evaluate for smallbowel obstruction showed a significantly cirrhotic and fattyliver with no masses. On admission , the patient's totalbilirubin was 2.5; however , her bilirubin levels escalatedprecipitously to a maximum of 17.6. At the same time , thepatient developed clinical manifestations of this , includingscleral icterus and jaundice. Also , as her albumin levelsdecreased to below 1.5 , she developed significant ascites andperipheral edema. Gastroenterology consult suggested a rightupper quadrant ultrasound , which was negative for obstruction , ahepatic MRI , which also showed a cirrhotic and fatty liver , andalso a diagnostic/therapeutic IR guided paracentesis , whichdrained 1 liter of sterile fluid. Hepatitis serologies were alsosent , and the patient was hepatitis A and B negative , but Cpositive; however , her viral load was less than assay , and herAFP was within normal limits. A rheumatologic workup forautoimmune hepatitis was also negative. Because of the acutenessand the timing of her presentation , it was felt that her liverfailure was likely secondary to a combination of hepatitis andalso toxicity from her Xeloda.On discharge , the patient's hepatic function had been improvingsignificantly for three days , with her albumin increasing , herINR decreasing and her bilirubin levels also decreasing. Ondischarge , her total bilirubin was 16.0 down from 17.6 , heralbumin was 1.9 up from 1.5 , and her INR was 1.6 down from 2.6.It is anticipated that as the patient's nutritional statuscontinues to improve , her hepatic function will continue tonormalize with resulting normalization of her laboratory values.3. Cardiovascular: On admission , the patient was in atrialfibrillation with rapid ventricular response at the rate ofapproximately 140 beats per minute. She was also hypotensive ,with a blood pressure of roughly 90/60. She was placed oncardiac telemetry , which recorded rapid a. fib. up to the 170s.As a result , she was given IV Lopressor with decreased heart ratebut also significant reduction in her blood pressure requiringfluid boluses. After 24 hours , after her blood pressure hadstabilized following the administration of intravenous fluids ,she was started on a diltiazem drip at 5 mg per hour , whichhelped to establish stable rate control in the 80s with continuedatrial fibrillation. At the same time , the patient was loadedwith digoxin , but her levels were high; given that the patientwas status post a recent admission for digoxin toxicity , thismedication was subsequently held. In one incident , the patientdeveloped a temporary junctional rhythm for approximately 5minutes with a heart rate in the 50s. At that point , input waselicited from the cardiology consult service , who thought thather symptoms were likely secondary to the diltiazem drip.However , given concern for a tachy-brady syndrome , thepossibility of an implantable cardiac pacemaker was discussed.However , the patient did not have any recurrence of thejunctional rhythm. A TTE was obtained , which showed an ejectionfraction of 60% with trace MR and moderate TR , left and rightatrial enlargement , and normal left and right ventricularfunction. Once the patient was again taking p.o. medications ,her diltiazem drip was changed to p.o. diltiazem. For the nextseveral days , the patient had several episodes each night of 3 to5 beat runs of NSVT. However , on the three days prior todischarge , the patient had no events on telemetry , and her heartrate was stable in the 60s to 80s , with a blood pressure runningfrom 90-100/50-60. Shortly before discharge , the patient alsodeveloped episodic shortness of breath , which was attributed tomild pulmonary edema , and she responded well to boluses of IVLasix. As a result , she was restarted on Aldactone witheffective gentle diuresis. The plan on discharge will be tofollow her volume status carefully and to adjust her diureticregimen as needed to maintain her volume status with continuedimprovement in her hepatic function.4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus ,and her metformin was held on admission secondary to an elevatedcreatinine. As a result , she was started on a lispro slidingscale. Given that she was n.p.o. for several days , she was notgiven any insulin and her blood sugars remained stable in the low100s. After she again started taking p.o. , she was restarted ona sliding scale , and she maintained excellent blood sugar controlbetween 100 and 150. A hemoglobin A1c obtained during thisadmission was also within normal limits. Of note , the patienthas a left toe ulcer , and was seen by orthopedic surgeries andoutpatient totally before admission.5. Heme: The patient had an INR of 2.6 on admission secondary tocirrhosis and poor nutrition. As a result , she was given vitaminK subcu n.p.o. as needed. As noted above , despite a history ofatrial fibrillation , the patient is not on Coumadin at homesecondary to poor med compliance. At home , she was only onaspirin , but this was also discontinue during the admissionsecondary to continued guaiac positive stool. Nevertheless , herhematocrit remained stable throughout her admission and she didnot require any transfusions. As DVT prophylaxis , the patientwas kept on Pneumo boots throughout the admission. At one point ,she was noted to have left upper extremity swelling greater thanthe right upper extremity , but an ultrasound was negative forDVT. As noted above , on discharge , the patient's INR wasimproving secondary to improved nutrition. She will bedischarged without any anticoagulation at present , however thiscan be further reevaluated as an outpatient by her cardiologistand oncologist.6. FEN: The patient was initially rehydrated with normal saline ,however this was changed to D5W plus 3 amps of bicarb since shedeveloped a bicarb gap. Once this gap was closed , she was givengentle normal saline as maintenance fluids. Once the patientstarted taking significant p.o. , her IV fluids were discontinued.The patient's electrolytes were also repleted as necessary.Plan on discharge will be to continue following her electrolytesclosely to prevent further exacerbation of her cardiacarrhythmias.7. Pain: The patient was given oxycodone p.o. and morphine IVfor pain. The patient was previously on Vioxx at home fororthopedic pain related to her diabetes , however , given recentdata suggesting possible cardiotoxic effects of Vioxx , this willbe discontinued , and she will be sent home with oxycodone p.r.n.for pain.8. Onc: The patient's Xeloda is currently on hold since many ofher symptoms leading up to this admission were likely secondaryto chemo toxicity. As noted above , the patient has otherevidence of chemo toxicity as well , including significantly driedskin on her hands and feet. The patient's outpatient oncologist ,Dr. Willard Brixius , followed her closely during this admission , andshe will follow up with the patient regarding possible changes toher chemotherapy regimen.9. Disposition: The patient was seen by the physical therapyservice shortly before discharge , and they noted that shedisplayed difficulty even moving from the bed to the chair , whichis significantly below her baseline of being able to ambulateindependently. As a result , after extensive discussions with herfamily , it was decided that the patient will be best served bygoing to a rehab facility for continued closed supervision of hermedical problems , supervised administration of her medicationregimen , continued strength training and conditioning , and alsocontinued nutrition. Once the patient is able to be lessdependent on outside assistance , she can be sent home with eithera home health aide or visiting nurse for continuedrehabilitation. Of note , the patient's code status wasestablished by her outpatient oncologist as DNR/DNI. This wasconfirmed with the patient during this hospitalization.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:Vital signs: Temperature 98.3 , pulse 80 , blood pressure 104/64 ,respiratory rate 20 , O2 sat 99% on room air.General: Alert , no acute distress , icteric sclerae , and slightlyjaundiced.Respiratory: CTAB except for few crackles at the basesbilaterally.CV: Irregularly irregular S1 , S2 , 1/6 SM at the left uppersternal border , no rubs/gallops.Abdomen: Soft , distended ( decreased from prior ) , mildly tender topalpation diffusely , normoactive bowel sounds.Extremities: Warm/well perfused , nontender , 1 to 2+ pedal edema ,1 to 2+ left upper extremity edema , significantly dry/crackedskin on hands and feet.LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:Sodium 137 , potassium 4.3 , bicarb 26 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 61 ,calcium 7.8 , magnesium 2.2 , WBC 15.1 with 87% polys , HCT 36.8 ,platelets 101 , 000 , INR 1.6 , ALT 18 , AST 46 , alk phos 103 , T. bili16.0 , total protein 5.8 , albumin 1.9.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Lispro sliding scale ( if blood sugar less than 135 , give 0 unitssubcutaneously; if blood sugar is 125 to 150 , then give 2 unitssubcutaneously; if blood sugar is 151 to 200 , then give 3 unitssubcutaneously; if blood sugar is 201 to 250 , then give 4 unitssubcutaneously; if blood sugar is 251 to 300 , then give 6 unitssubcutaneously; if blood sugar is 301 to 350 , then give 8 unitssubcutaneously; if blood sugar is 351 to 400 , then give 10 unitssubcutaneously ) , multivitamin one q.d. , Protonix 40 mg q.d. ,diltiazem 60 mg t.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg q.d. , oxycodone 5 to 10mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.insomnia , Compazine 5 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , vitamin K 5 mgp.o. q.d.DISPOSITION:The patient was discharged to rehab in stable condition.PHYSICIAN FOLLOW-UP PLANS:The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation facility , whereshe will continue to be given supportive care for ongoingsymptoms of her enteritis and hepatic failure.

In6/28 , she presented to Good Niton Community Hospital with history ofprogressive dyspnea and congestive heart failure noted at anoutside hospital. Ejection fraction at that time on echo was 18% ,with severe MR and TR. She was admitted and an echo done at theCo.wer Hospital Medical Center showed moderate left ventricular dilatation with an EF of25-30% , with only mild regional variability. There was also rightventricular dilatation with mild decrease in function. Mitralvalve was thickened with severe MI. CAT at that time showed 71%left-sided lesion. The patient underwent , in 6/28 , mitral valverepair and one-vessel CABG lemma to the LAD. She had an uneventfulpost-op course. Her post-op echo on 6/12/95 revealed LVdilatation with clear EF of 23% and good IV function. Moderateresidual mitral regurgitation and moderate TR. Post-op weight ofthe patient was 177 lb.Post-operatively , the patient did well initially , when she had PNDand orthopnea that was marked prior to surgery , she is able to walknow , and when she was only able to walk only 40 ft. beforestopping. She now sleeps flat on her bed with improved exercisetolerance. She experiences near total resolution of the PND andorthopnea initially. However , in the period between 6/28 to7/30 , the above symptoms recurred with progressive shortness ofbreath , dyspnea on exertion , cough and positional chest pains. On3/13/95 , the patient saw her physician and was noted to have alarge left pleural effusion at an outside hospital. A leftthoracentesis was done. Patient noted 1 liter of bloody fluid thatwas tapped from her thoracentesis. Post-procedural weight was 169lb. She was able to breath more easily.Status post the left thoracentesis , the patient initially feltwell. However , within the next few days , she continued to developworsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion , as well asPND and orthopnea. She , therefore , represents on 1/2/96 forrecurrence of her symptoms and recurrence of left pleural effusion.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE , MITRAL REPAIRSTATUS POST 1/10 ( 2 ) CABG X1 , EILEMMA TOTHE LAD IN 1/10 ( 3 ) HYPERTENSION; ( 4 ) ASTHMA; ( 5 ) HYPOTHYROIDISM;( 6 ) HISTORY OF STROKE X3 , LAST STROKE IN 1987; ( 7 ) HISTORY OF TIAs;( 8 ) HYPOCHOLESTEROLEMIA; ( 9 ) HISTORY OF SEIZURE DISORDER STATUSPOST MVA; ( 10 ) CHRONIC DVTS; ( 11 ) TAH/BSO; ( 12 ) HEPATITIS HISTORY;( 13 ) CYSTOCELE REPAIR.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Digoxin .25 qd; Vasotec 10 mg qd; Lasix40 mg qd; Flexeril clear dose b.i.d.;Coumadin 7.5 mg alternating with 10 mg q.h.s.; Synthroid 15 mcg qd;Benadryl 50 mg p.r.n.; Prozac 10 mg b.i.d.; Mevacor 20 mg qd.SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco use.

Nopulmonary edema , and no infiltrations.EKG - sinus tachy at 108 , with frequent PVCs and bigeminy.Intervals were normal. Axis of 21 degrees. Left atrialenlargement. No acute ischemic changes.HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Franz was initially admitted with adiagnosis of left pleural effusion of unclearetiology. A left thoracentesis was performed and the fluid wasdeemed exudative. It was bloody in appearance and had a whitecount greater than 4 , 000 , with a red cell count greater than500 , 000. Patient met criteria for exudative fluid byfluid-serum-LDH ratios , fluid-serum-protein ratio and LDH greaterthan 200. Subsequent cultures , however , were negative for abacterial fungal AFB. Rheumatology etiologies were also R/O withnegative ANA and negative rheumatoid factor. Cytology was sent onthe patient , which also returned negative for malignant cells. Atotal of 1.5 liters was drained from the thoracentesis. Subsequentto the thoracentesis , the patient felt significantly better , withbetter exercise tolerance and less orthopnea. She remains with RAOto sats greater than 95% for the remainder of her hospitalizationand did not require oxygen. A repeat chest x-ray was done prior todischarge , and compared to post-thoracentesis , showed nosignificant accumulation of the left pleural effusion.Initially it was felt that the patient's symptoms might have somerelationship to some element of congestive heart failure. She wasstarted on Digoxin and Captopril and maxed at Digoxin .25 q day andCaptopril 50 mg t.i.d. During this hospitalization , however , thepatient noted in passing , that she had , since her 6/28 surgery ,developed significant dizziness and orthostatic symptoms uponsitting up and rising , and had limited exercise tolerance partlybecause of shortness of breath , but also partly because of herdizziness symptoms. She noted occasional vertigo and occasionaldiplopia. A work-up subsequently ensued related to the symptoms.Neurology was consulted and carotid Dopplers , as well as MRA of thehead to R/O vertebral basal insufficiency were performed. Bothcarotid Dopplers revealed less than 25 stenosis bilaterally and MRAof the head revealed no vertebral basal insufficiency. However , itwas noted on repeated measurements of the patient's bloodpressures , that when she sat up and when she stood up , she becamehypotensive. A modified Bruce protocol stress test was performedto determine the patient's exercise tolerance. Prior to initiationof the modified Bruce , supine blood pressure was 120/80. Uponsitting up , the patient's blood pressure was 92 and upon beginningthe modified Bruce within less than one minute , the patient's bloodpressure dipped to 60 systolic , and test was terminated. Anechocardiogram during this admission revealed an ejection fractionof 30% , moderate LV dilatation , severe global hyperkinesis ,preserved right ventricular function and size , and only trivial MRand TR. No significant arrhythmias were noted on the patient'scardiac monitor throughout her hospitalization , except for oneepisode of transient third degree heart block with a ventricularrhythm. The patient did not demonstrate this rhythm consistently ,however , during her hypertensive episodes.On review of the patient's past medical history , however , it wasfound that the patient had been on chronic steroids for two yearsprior to her 6/28 CABG and prior to the onset of these symptoms oforthostasis and dizziness. Patient notes that she was more on thanoff on p.o. steroids for treatment of her shortness of breath at anoutside hospital in Perv Rome Voraso , Nevada 15117 At that time , they had deemed that hershortness of breath symptoms were secondary to pulmonary etiologiesrather than cardiac. We , therefore , suspected adrenalinsufficiency and consulted endocrine. ACTH stem test wasperformed and Cortisol , Adolsterone and ACTH levels were drawn at0:30 and 60 minutes post-administration of ACTH. The patientdeveloped hives and angioedema with the ACTH which was relievedwith Benadryl IV. After the performance of the ACTH stem testempirically started on Hydrocortisone 80 mg IV. The next day thepatient's symptoms resolved and she no longer had any evidence oforthostatic hypertension or dizziness symptoms related to standingor walking. Repeated blood pressure measurements for orthostaticwere unyielding. The patient noted her symptoms are completelyresolved and that she felt like a different person. It was ,therefore , felt that the empiric trial of hydrocortisone wassignificant and that the patient most likely had adrenalinsufficiency secondary to chronic steroid for the two years priorto the 6/28 CABG , and this was consistent with the time closer topatient's symptoms , which began after the 6/28 CABG when she wasoff steroids.The patient was therefore discharged in stable condition withdiagnosis of a left pleural effusion secondary to most likely apost-pericardiotomy syndrome , as well as orthostatic hypertensionand dizziness symptoms secondary to adrenal insufficiency. At thetime of discharge , the patient's ACTH stem test was still pending ,as well as the TSH. It was felt at the time of discharge , thepatient should not be managed on Captopril or Digoxin. It remainedunclear whether or not the patient's current ejection fraction wasadequate for her symptoms.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Flexeril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d; Benadryl 50 mgp.o. b.i.d; Prednisone 20 mg p.o. b.i.d;Prozac 20 mg p.o. qd; Synthroid 50 mcg p.o. qd; Mevacor 20 mg p.o.qd; Quinaam 325 mg p.o. q.h.s.DISPOSITION: Patient was discharged home to Li Ston Hi Therewere no complications during this admission. Patientwas discharged in a stable condition , with no estimated disability.The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Otha Brue in 12/10 .Dictated By: JACOB MENNA , M.D. WM18Attending: PHILIP B.

Pt. felt somewhat nauseous on coming home fromwork on day PTA. Wife noticed pallor when he came home , calledambulance. Was found to be in monomorphic Vtach to 200 which respondedto lidocaine. Lidocaine drip d/c'd in AM of transfer in the abscene offurther VT. Pt found to have troponin of 0.8 atoutside hospital. It was initially unclear if the pt had an ischemicevent which caused VT , or if the pt's VT caused a bump in cardiacenzymes. Pt also has anginal equivalent w/jaw pain whichworsens when the pt carries heavy things or walksup flights of stairs. Recent outside echocardiogram showed EF 15-20% ,w/ global hypokinesis. PE onadmission w/JVP 10 cm , faint crackles ,II/VI SEM worse w/inc. afterload. EKG , unchanged from11/1 .HOSPITALCOURSE 1. Ischemia - The patient was admitted to the cardiacservice. Given the presence of vtach and a slight EKG bump , andclinical signs of heart failure , the initial presentation wassuspicious for CAD. Thepatient was initially diuresed slowly , however , the pt began to developworsening HTN and shortness of breath along w/a prolonged episode ofvtach and was subsequentlydiuresed aggressively by approximately 5 L. The patient was alsoloaded w/amiodarone. The patient's weight also dropped 5 kg. Left andrightcoronary catheterization were performed and revealed only a discrete rtPDA lesion 60% and a discrete 60% D1 , otherwise essentially clean. Nointerventions werenecessary. The right heart catheterization revealed a PCWP of 6 afterthe diuresis. The patient had no further vtach episodes on amiodaroneand was discharged on 400 mg qd of amiodarone.The patient had anICD placed on 3/16/2004 .  The initial plan was for the patient to alsohave his aflutter ablated to decrease the propensity for vtach ,however , the presence of a lt atrial clot could not be ruled out duringTEE , so rhythm ablation was deferred. An transthroracic echocardiogramwasalso performed prior to discharge which revealed EF of 30% , w/anteriorakinesis and global hypokinesis. A broad differential diagnosis for hisheart failure was entertained , however no conclusive etiology could bedetermined. The patient is to follow up with his cardiologist and his PCP. These appointments were coordinated by the attending physician ,Dr. Versteegh . He should also follow up w/Dr. Yafuso as described in thatsection. For the patient's afib , he should take coumadin , 5 mg , for thenext three nights and should subsequently drop down to 2.5 mg qd ,unless differently as suggested by his INR which should be drawn onMonday , May , and Wed September by the VNA. The patient should call anMD immediately w/chest pain , sob , or pallor. The patient's bloodpressure medications were also significantly adjusted to maximum doseswhile the patient was under close acute care monitoring to facilitateoptimization of his outpt regimens. Additional changes at thediscretion of the pt's PCP , Dr. Schwarm . The patient also presented w/anelevated creatinine which slowly returned to normal levels during thehospitalization. The elevated creatinine was most likely due to acombination of hypoperfusion secondary to vtach , and dye load fromcatheterization.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:DISCHARGE CONDITION: StableTO DO/PLAN:F/u as described above.

Since her discharge in August ,she had been complaining of increasing shortness of breath and onthe Friday prior to admission , she was at her usual dialysisappointment where she got a transfusion of packed red blood cellsand intravenous iron when she began to feel "warm all over". Thefollowing night , her son noted her to be rigorous and she felt thepresence of fever. She was brought to the emergency room havingreceived three sublingual nitroglycerin en route for shortness ofbreath. Her initial vital signs showed a 90% oxygen saturation onroom air and an axillary temperature of 100 degrees. Her bloodpressure and heart rate were stable at 150/75 and 83 respectively.In the emergency room , she became increasingly dyspneic with anarterial blood gas of pH 7.26 , pCO2 of 64 , pO2 of 84 and wassubsequently intubated for respiratory distress. She also receivedheparin in the setting of a questionable pulmonary embolus. Shehad a few runs of ventricular tachycardia and became bradycardic tothe 50s. Lidocaine 100 mg x 1 was given in the emergency room.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for end stage renal disease onhemodialysis since September , 2001secondary to her diabetes , right lower extremity calf deep venousthrombosis in 1995 , long-standing diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,external hemorrhoids , congestive heart failure secondary todiastolic dysfunction , diverticulitis , appendectomy in October of2001 , left cataract surgery.ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to penicillin giving heredema , aspirin giving her edema , Prazosin , Micronase ,Dyazide , ACE inhibitors and intravenous contrast.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: NPH insulin 20 units in the morning , 25units in the evening , Zocor 80 mg atnight and intravenous iron given at hemodialysis.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: On admission to the Reyand Memorial Hospital medical intensive careunit , initial physical examination showed a temperature of 105 ,heart rate 90 , blood pressure 90/50 , respiratory rate 12 on amechanical ventilator , oxygen saturation 100%. GENERAL: Thepatient was intubated , sedated. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic.Pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodating.NECK: Supple , no thyroid nodules noted. CHEST: She had rightgreater than left crackles a quarter of the way up the lung fields.HEART: Regular rate , normal S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4 appreciated.No rub or gallop. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended withhypoactive bowel sounds , but no hepatosplenomegaly. EXTREMITIES:Trace edema. NEUROLOGICAL: She was sedated and on a ventilator ,but was responsive to repositioning and touch.LABORATORY: Her admission laboratory values included a sodium of140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 100 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN31 , creatinine 5.0 , glucose 193. White blood cell count was 13 ,hematocrit 36 , platelet count 387. Differential showed 77 polys , 4bands , 15 lymphocytes. INR was 1.0. CK was 56. Troponin I was0.04. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein , 1+ glucose , 5-7 white bloodcells , 3-5 red blood cells. Admission EKG was normal sinus rhythm ,flat T-waves in V5 and V6. Chest x-ray was notable for bilateralinfiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 68-year-old Spanish speakingwoman with end stage renal disease from insulindependent diabetes on hemodialysis on Monday , Wednesday and Friday ,hypertension , coronary artery disease and congestive heart failurewith a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1995 , notably hadseveral recent admissions for fluid overload and a recent placementof a tunneled internal jugular catheter for hemodialysis. She wasadmitted with fever , chills and shortness of breath on July ,2001 requiring intubation for three days , pressor support ,Neo-Synephrine and dopamine for two days , but was then successfullyextubated and weaned off the pressors for management outside theintensive care unit. Her course in the medical intensive care unitwas complicated by rule in non-Q wave myocardial infarction thoughtto be secondary to sepsis and hypotensive state. Her troponinsmaxed in the 6-7 range , but this episode resolved withoutsignificant EKG changes. She was titrated up on a beta blocker andgiven Plavix in place of aspirin as she has an allergy to aspirin.She was also continued on her statin. The patient would likelybenefit from further outpatient work-up of her cardiac status onceher rehabilitative course is complete , i.e. imaging and stress.Her last catheterization was four years ago showing three vesselstenoses of about 40-50%. She is currently getting hemodialysisnow through her arteriovenous fistula and getting dosed withvancomycin at hemodialysis for the next four to six weeks. She hadserially positive blood cultures for methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus. The last was on February , but hadnegative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophagealechocardiogram ( i.e. no vegetations ). She received gentamicinbriefly in addition to the vancomycin until two consecutivesurveillance cultures were negative and is now off the gentamicin.She was noted to have a loud neck murmur and had both venous andarterial ultrasounds which were negative for septic clot orsignificant stenosis respectively. Otherwise , her post medicalintensive care unit course was uncomplicated and we restarted herinsulin regimen as her appetite increased. The patient is due forhemodialysis on tomorrow , Wednesday , March , 2001. She needsfollow up with her primary care physician for further cardiacevaluation , titration of her diabetes medications and follow up ofher lipids , diabetes and hypertension. Of note , the patient hasrefused to give the name of her primary care physician and does notwant to return to her care. She states to the interpreter that shewould like a new primary care physician.PLAN: 1 ) Dialysis tomorrow on Wednesday , March , 2001. 2 )Aggressive rehabilitation for her strengthening. 3 )Titration of diabetes medications and general healthcaremaintenance follow up.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4-6h. fortemperature greater than 101 , PhosLo 667mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enema or laxative ofchoice one per day p.r.n. bowel movement , NPH insulin 15 unitssubcutaneously b.i.d. which is two-thirds of her home dose , needstitrating up , regular insulin sliding scale , Simvastatin 80 mgq.h.s. , Toprol XL 50 mg q. day , Nephro-vite capsule one q. day ,miconazole 2% powder topically b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day ,Nexium 20 mg p.o. q. day.Dictated By: LINCOLN MCCRONE , WI48Attending: ENRIQUE X.

EKG showed Q waves in 2 , 3and aVF with T-wave inversions ( old findings , no acute changes ).Echo ( 9/19 ): EF 35% ( down from 55% in 5/24 ) , mild concentricLVH , diffuse global hypokinesis with new akinesis of theseptal-inferior walls.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular:a. Pump - persistent volume overload , minimal response todiuresis with 20 mg/hour Lasix drip. Attempted diuresis withDiuril , Lasix IV , and finally nesiritide. Nesiritidediscontinued on 7/11/05 .  Torsemide was started on 7/11/05 withimproved diuresis. The patient has consistently refuseddialysis. Blood pressure was controlled during thishospitalization with hydralazine , Isordil , and Lopressor. Allmedications were stopped on 6/12/05 .  Ejection fraction 35%.b. Ischemia - enzymes peaked on 4/13/05 with a CK of 152 , an MBof 39.6 , and a troponin of 21.44. EKG at this time showed STdepressions in V4 through V6. The recommendation of theCardiology team was that the patient undergo cardiaccatheterization. The patient refused any intervention withcardiac catheterization due to concerns of further damage to herkidneys. A decision was made to medically manage the patient.She was briefly on heparin while this decision was concluded , andheparin was stopped on 7/6/05 with enzymes trending down , andno evidence of active ischemia.c. Rhythm - the patient had bursts of normal sinus ventriculartachycardia on telemetry. She was maintained on a low-dosebeta-blocker until 7/11/05 .  She has been in a normal sinusrhythm from 4/13/05 through 6/12/05 .2. Pulmonary: The patient has an oxygen requirement of 2 literssecondary to a right pleural effusion and congestive heartfailure. The patient's IV diuretics were stopped on 6/12/05 inconsideration of changing goals of care. If the patient becomesshort of breath in the absence of diuretics , we would recommendmorphine elixir 10 mg q.2 h. as needed for shortness of breath.3. Renal: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency was likelysecondary to hypertension and diabetes. MRA on 4/13/05 toevaluate for renal artery stenosis showed right renal arterystenosis. The patient's creatinine increased to 4 on 7/11/05 ,likely secondary to diuresis. Ultrasound was refused. The Renalconsult team was following , but the patient refused any dialysis.4. Endo: The patient's diabetes was controlled with Lantusinsulin and an aspart insulin sliding scale. There was concernfor hypoglycemia on 6/12/05 in the setting with no oral intake.All of the patient's diabetic medications have been stopped atthis time.5. Psychiatry: The Psychiatry consult team was consulted formajor depressive disorder. There was concern for delirium.Celexa was started for depression. Seroquel was tried p.r.n. forinsomnia and delirium , but it was stopped due to change in mentalstatus. The patient was able to make her own medical decisionsat the time of refusing cardiac catheterization. She understoodthe risk of refusing cardiac catheterization. We will continueno psychiatric medications at the time of discharge. Mayconsider Haldol for concern regarding worsening delirium.6. The patient is currently DNR/DNI , comfort measures only. Sheis being transferred to inpatient hospice at Gateho Health .MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:Include morphine elixir 10 mg p.o. q.2 h. as needed for shortnessof breath.CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:Poor.eScription document: 7-2589349 EMSSten TelDictated By: GABAK , NEVILLEAttending: MATSUZAKI , ARLIEDictation ID 1540731D: 6/12/05T: 6/12/05

He was in his rehab therapy one week prior toadmission when he twisted his knee. He gave him some factor IXat this time with some relief , but in the intervening time , ithad become more painful , red and swollen , and was unable to walkwithout great difficulty where as before he had been toleratingrehab with a walker without incident. In addition , he had atemperature to 103.0 degrees , two days prior to admission and wasgiven vancomycin and gentamicin dialysis the day prior toadmission. The knee , however , continued to worsen , and he has asignificant restriction in range of motion , and he reported tothe emergency department for concern for an infected knee versushemarthrosis. He reported some fatigue and decreased p.o.intake. He did have chills with his fever. He denied anyshortness of breath , chest pain , abdominal pain , nausea , vomitingor bleeding. Of note , he has chronic ascites , which for the pastthree months has required paracentesis three times weekly with atotal of 3 to 4 liters taken off each time. In the emergencydepartment , he was loaded with factor IX by the hematologyfellow. The knee was then tapped by Orthopedics , whichdemonstrated only some dark blood and minimal fluid. He wasadmitted to the Renal Service given that he is a dialysispatient.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Hemophilia factor IX deficiency.2. Hepatitis C virus with cirrhosis and chronic ascites.3. HIV.4.

He is not currently working.FAMILY HISTORY:Notable for factor IX deficiency hemophilia.PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:The patient was afebrile , slight tachycardiac at 105 , andnormotensive at 120/72 , sating well on room air. General: Hewas cachetic and chronically ill appearing , alert and oriented ,and comfortable. Neck veins were flat. Cardiovascular exam wasnotable for regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 , S2 and a 3/6holosystolic murmur at the apex. Chest was notable for mildbibasilar crackles , otherwise clear. Abdomen was distended ,notable for flank dullness. He did have normal active bowelsounds and a peritoneal port on the right. Extremities werenotable for being wasted , warm with absent pulses. Right kneewas erythematous , edematous , and extremely tender to palpation.LABS ON ADMISSION:Notable for potassium of 5.2 , BUN of 42 , and creatinine of 4.2.His liver function panel was within normal limits. His whiteblood cell count was 10.4 , hematocrit 36.6 , and platelets332 , 000. His PT was 15.4 , PTT 62.3 , and INR was 1.2. X-ray ofhis right knee demonstrated an effusion and no fracture. A chestx-ray demonstrated a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis.His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 70.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:On 8/22/04 , he had an incision and drainage of his right knee byDr. Moelter of Orthopedics. On 10/20/04 , he had ahemodialysis-tunneled catheter placed by InterventionalRadiology. On 2/7/04 , he had a PICC line placed at thebedside , and he underwent hemodialysis.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Musculoskeletal and Infectious Disease: He was admitted tothe Renal Service for treatment of septic arthritis of his rightknee , which was a prosthetic joint. Blood cultures were positivefor methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus , which was theorganism , which had caused his prior endocarditis. He underwentincision and drainage of his right knee by Orthopedic Service ,Dr. Majka , on 8/22/04 .  In addition , his hemodialysis catheterwas pulled on 10/15/04 because it too had grown blood culturespositive for MSSA. He had no further positive cultures once hisdialysis catheter was pulled except for 1/4 bottles coag-negativeStaph from 9/23/04 , which was attributed to contamination. Hewas treated with vancomycin and gentamicin just after dialysis.He received a total of seven days of gentamicin and was on day#14 of a six-week course of vancomycin upon discharge. He hadsome low-grade temperature during admission but only onetemperature spiked to 101 degrees. Both Orthopedics andInfectious Disease Services were consulted and followed himthroughout admission. Orthopedics and Infectious Diseaseconsultant determined that if any blood cultures became positiveafter removal of the hemodialysis catheter , he would need toreturn to the OR for joint exploitation. Given his negativeculture this did not occur and he is discharged with prostheticjoint in place. The joint fluid culture as well synovial tissueand synovial culture from his I&D were positive for MSSA.Surveillance cultures were negative for seven days following theprocedure. He was instructed to continue vancomycin for a totalof six-week course and to follow up with Infectious Disease intwo months. He was cleared for physical therapy and returned torehab by Orthopedics with instructions to remove his suturesthree weeks after discharge and to follow up with Orthopedic , Dr.Glader , as indicated by his symptom.2. Hematology: He has factor IX deficiency hemophilia for whichhe normally takes q. week or twice weekly factor IX beforedialysis. During admission , he was initially loaded with factorIX in the emergency department for arthrocentesis. Hematologywas consulted and they recommended b.i.d. factor IX 4000 unitsduring admission while the situation regarding surgery and lineplacement was unclear. He continued receiving b.i.d. factor IXuntil the day of discharge as his last line was placed on thatday. He was to return to factor IX before dialysis only uponreturn to rehab and was to follow up with Dr. Tutson , hisprimary hematologist. In addition , he received erythropoietinwith dialysis.3. Renal: He has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysisMondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays. He continued this regimenwhile he had his hemodialysis catheter in place , however , whenthat was removed , he was dialyzed to a temporary femoral arterycatheter and only as clinically indicated. He was dialyzed mostrecently on 10/20/04 after his dialysis catheter was replaced byInterventional Radiology , and he should return to his Monday ,Wednesday , Friday schedule. He was continued on his home renalsupplements. He was continued on erythropoietin with dialysisand midodrine.4. GI: He has HCV cirrhosis and chronic ascites and history ofspontaneous bacterial peritonitis as well as upper and lower GIbleed. He had no evidence of bleeding during admission. Theoccult blood was negative x3. He additionally had no evidence ofinfection or SPP. He was taped by a peritoneal port thriceweekly with removal of 3 to 4 liters of fluid each time. Thefirst set was sent for culture , which was negative.Additionally , he was continued on his b.i.d. proton pumpinhibitor given his history of upper GI bleed.5. Endocrine: He has diabetes for which he was covered withRegular Insulin sliding scale upon admission. Given someelevated blood sugars up to 300s and the risk of bacteremia , hewas started on NPH and was discharged on 10 q.a.m. and 5 q.p.m.with continued Regular Insulin sliding scale for added coverage.6. Prophylaxis: He was not anticoagulated despite hisimmobility. Given his hemophilia , he was placed on TED hose andpneumoboots and continued on his PPI.7. FEN: Nutrition was consulted because of his low albumin andgeneral cachexia. He was placed on a 1.5 liters fluidrestriction and 2 g sodium restriction given his chronic ascites.He is also on a diabetic diet and renal diet.

STATUS POST CARDIOVERSION TOSINUS RHYTHM.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Zack Nieman is a 62-year-oldwhite man with ischemiccardiomyopathy , status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1985with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending ,saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery , saphenous veingraft to obtuse marginal branch. He had a repeat coronary arterybypass graft done in 1995 with saphenous vein graft to firstdiagonal , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal , and saphenousvein graft to posterior descending artery. The course wascomplicated by ventricular tachycardia requiring AICD placement andtreatment with amiodarone. The patient also developedhyperthyroidism secondary to amiodarone , treated with PTU , thendeveloped hypothyroidism , treated with Levothyroxine.Over the past few months the patient has had multiple episodes ofpulmonary congestion. About one week ago prior to this admission thepatient was admitted to Rorea Valley Health for IV diuresis.Echocardiography demonstrated that a reduced LV ejection fraction inthe mid 20's with moderate mitral regurgitation. Recent EKGsprovided by the Scot Free Of Hospital and on admission here showsatrial flutter with variable ventricular rate. On admission thepatient denied peripheral edema , orthopnea , or recent gain inweight. A recent TSH revealed 10. No recent excess caffeine oralcohol consumption.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for ( 1 ) coronary arterydisease , status post coronary arterybypass graft times two; ( 2 ) hypertension; ( 3 ) hypothyroidism;( 4 ) dyslipidemia; ( 5 ) benign prostatic hypertrophy; ( 6 )degenerative joint disease; ( 7 ) non-insulin dependent diabetesmellitus.ALLERGIES: The patient has a known allergy to morphine and totetanus toxoid.FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of myocardial infarction at age 66.Mother died of myocardial infarction at age 63.SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco use. No alcohol use. Very activeathletically. He works as a superintendant.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General appearance , very pleasant manin no apparent distress. Temperature97.1 , pulse 103 , blood pressure 148/94 , respirations 18 , O2saturation 97% on two liters. HEENT pupils are equal , round , andreactive to light. Sclerae anicteric. Oral pharynx clear andmoist. Jugular venous pressure about 8-9 cm. No carotid bruits.Chest clear to auscultation and percussion. No rales and nowheezes. Heart paradoxical S2 , II/VI systolic murmur. Abdomensoft , nontender , with no pulsatile masses. Lower extremities noedema , no cyanosis , or clubbing. Rectal examination normal , guaiacnegative. Neurological examination grossly intact.ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES: Sodium 141 , potassium 4.4 ,chloride 101 , bicarb 34 , BUN 19 ,creatinine 1.3 , glucose 220 , AST 22 , ALK 53 , total bilirubin 0.6 ,calcium 9.8 , total protein 7.1 , albumin 4.4 , magnesium 1.9 , CK 477 ,MB 2.7 , PT 12.7 , INR 1.1 , PTT 24.2. Urinalysis 1+ glucose ,otherwise negative.EKG revealed atrial flutter with variable block ( 2:1 versus 3:1 ) ,rate around 120 , left bundle branche block.Echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction about 25% with 2+ mitralregurgitation.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's hospital course was notable for thefollowing: Upon transfer from Nes Hospitalto A Hospital the patient had no complaints ofshortness of breath or chest pain. However , the patient was havingatrial flutter with various blocks. The ventricular response atthat time was between 120-130. On the day of admission the patient also hadechocardiogram repeated which revealed ejection fraction 25% with2+ mitral regurgitation.Because of his rapid ventricular response , Digoxin was started witha loading dose of 0.5 mg , then 0.25 mg times two q. six hours. Thepatient was then on a maintenance dose of Digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o.q. day , and his Digoxin level has been maintained around 0.9. Forhis rate control , the amiodarone was also increased to 400 mg q.day , and the patient was started on anticoagulation with heparin.On August the patient underwent cardiac catheterizationwhich revealed old grafts serving the left anterior descending ,posterior descending artery , obtuse marginal , patent. Thesaphenous vein graft to first diagonal has 70% proximal stenosis.Left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 10-15%. Postcatheterization the patient had no complications. The patient alsohad a TEE done which showed no thrombosis. Therefore on September the patient underwent cardioversion through his AICD by theElectrophysiological Service with successful conversion to normalsinus rhythm. The patient was loaded with Coumadin and meanwhileon heparin until INR between 2-3.For further investigation of his cardiomyopathy , iron studies weresent to rule out hemochromatosis. The results were negative.Cardiomyopathy consult was also obtained to follow-up the patient.The patient will be discharged when his INR approaches thetherapeutic level , which is between 2-3.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Captopril25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , clonazepam 1 mg p.o.q. h.s. , Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o. q. a.m. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. ,Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , levothyroxinesodium 100 mcg p.o. q.d. , magnesium oxide 420 mg p.o. q.d. ,Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 ( 0.4 mg ) one tabsublingual q. five minutes times three , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. dayuntil INR between 2-3 then the dose needs to be adjustedaccordingly to maintain INR between 2-3 , Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , isosorbide , mononitrate-SR 30 mg p.o. q.d. , and troglipazone400 mg p.o. q. day.CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.DISPOSITION/FOLLOW-UP: The patient will be discharged to homeon 10 of August with a follow-upappointment with Dr. Furbeck , Rudy Lonny Napoleon D. of theCardiomyopathy Service.Dictated By: BRADLEY WROBLISKI , M.D.Attending: TYSON C.

Prior to thisadmission , the patient was at baseline Class III heart failurewith dyspnea on exertion at about 20 feet. Following the CHFadmission , the patient is on 2 liter home O2 and stated she hadbeen stable for about a week , but able to do her chores with 2liter O2. Had been fully at home VNA and saw her PCP on the dayprior to admission without any change in her status. On thenight prior to admission , however , she stated she had heartraising and could not sleep. Overnight , she had increasedshortness of breath , but without any chest pain orlightheadedness. Daughter called in the morning and saw thepatient with increasing oxygen requirement to 3 liter and calledVNA who noted her sat in 80s on 4 liter and told the patient tocome into the hospital. The patient stated that she has beentried to stick to her low-sodium diet and taking the homemedication. Of note , the patient has been taking double dose ofSunday meds. Denies fever , chills , chest pain and worsen cough.She has baseline cough with white sputum production. In ED , thepatient was sating at 99% on non-rebreather.

Chestx-ray bilateral infiltrate , left greater than right effusion.TTE on 5/22 , decreased LV size , ejection fraction 80% , no wallmotion abnormality , normal RV , moderate LAE , trace MR , TR ,hypodynamic heart , PA systolic pressure at 38.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is an 80 years old female with historyof AFib and CHF , diastolic dysfunction with EF of 80% and COPDwho was recently discharged for CHF w low dose lasix of 20mg nowis found to be in CHF in a setting with suspected AFib with LVR.The patient also had acute on chronic renal insufficiency likelysecondary to low flow from her volume status. The patient wasadmitted for diuresis and for the rate control.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:Ischemia: There is no evidence of ischemia. The patient wasruled out with serial enzymes. She was continued on aspirin , nobetablocker , and short acting diltiazem and statin. Herbeta-blocker was initially not initiated , however , on three daysprior to discharge , she was started on short-dose beta-blockadedue to hypertension. She tolerated that reasonably well ,however , did have episodes of bradycardia to 40s. Decision wasreached to defer starting betablockade on her until herappointment with her cardiologist. Her BB was discontinued.Pump: The patient was volume over loaded on chest x-ray with BNPgreater than 500. The patient has EF of 80% with hypodynamicheart. The patient was diuresing initially with 80 IV Lasix andsubsequently increased to 120 b.i.d. of IV Lasix. She wasdiuresed slowly at about 500 mL everyday. Ultimately , her Lasixwas switched over to 160 p.o. b.i.d. with very good diuresis , buther creatinine was elevated , prompting decreasing her Lasix backdown to 120 p.o. b.i.d. She will continue on this dose ondischarge and has a followup with her primary care physician forcreatinine trial and make sure that her creatinine is trendingdown. We did not want to over diuresis the patient given hervolume dependence and the diastolic dysfunction especially as wesuspect that the heart failure is secondary to her rhythm , butnot really significant volume overload. She had a repeat chestx-ray three days prior to admission , which shows slightlyimproving pulmonary edema and pulmonary effusion. She was torepeat lytes and her creatinine was followed very closely.Rhythm: She was in afib w RVR initially. The patient wasstarted on diltiazem t.i.d. We hold her dig initially as herlevel was elevated to 2.4 eventually. Her dig was restarted at0.125 mg p.o. every three days. Her dig level will need to befollowed as an outpatient. Her dig was stable on this particulardose. We also started her on short acting beta-blocker withLopressor at 6.25 t.i.d. She will be reduced to 6.25 b.i.d. ondischarge. The patient tolerated the Lopressor though had a fewepisodes of bradycardia. BB was d/c on discharge.Pulmonary: The patient has shortness of breath , despitesecondary to CHF and COPD. The patient was given nebs and herAdvair. She was on 4 liter of oxygen on discharge and she willbe self-weaned at home to 2 liter as possible.Heme: She has chronic baseline shortness of breath. She wascontinued on her Coumadin for anticoagulation. INR was stablethroughout the hospital stay.Renal: Has acute renal insufficiency on chronic renalinsufficiency. Her Avapro was held initially. Suspect that heracute renal insufficiency is secondary to poor flow in thesetting of AFib and atrial flutter and failure. Her renalfunction actually improved slightly upon diuresis , however , shebumped her creatinine slightly on discharge secondary tohigh-dose Lasix. Her Lasix will be decreased to 120 b.i.d. p.o.on discharge and her creatinine will be checked two days afterdischarge.ID: No evidence of infection. She has some sputum that was sentwith normal flora. Blood culture and urine culture was negative.Chest PA and lateral was also negative for any evidence ofconsolidation or infection.FEN: She was kept on the low-salt ADA diet , cardiac diet with Kand mag repletion.Prophylasix: Pt was anticoagulated with Coumadin and also on aPPI.CODE STATUS: She was full code.DISPOSITION: She is to follow up with her primary care physicianand also cardiologist.

The patientwas recently admitted to an outside hospital for questionableviral gastroenteritis and discharged four days ago. Since thelast admission , he was noted to have increased right lowerextremity pain and erythema , was sent home on levofloxacin as anoutpatient for presumed cellulitis. Actually , despite being onlevofloxacin , right lower extremity edema and pain increased overfour days and became more painful to walk. The patient hadsubjective fevers , but none documented on record. The patientwith no severe pain over the right patellar. It hurts to flexand/or bend the knee. Baseline right lower extremity is now muchworse than it was prior. The patient was without pain in calf orthigh. There is no shortness of breath or chest pain. Wifeprovides daily diabetic foot care , and he had recurrentcellulitis of the right lower extremity in the past , but none inthe past year. No history of trauma. In the ED the patient withsmall right knee effusion was tapped by ortho and fluid sent tolab , it was bloody without any other growth at that time. Thepatient was also given vancomycin in the ED prior to admission.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Includes PVD , peripheral vascular disease , diabetic neuropathy ,diabetes mellitus type II , chronic renal insufficiency , CADstatus post CABG , history of GI bleed in the past , history ofsepsis from right lower extremity cellulitis in the past , statuspost right femoral-peroneal bypass.ALLERGIES:No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Carbamazepine 100 mg b.i.d. , NovoLog 5 mg q. a.c. , Lipitor 80 mgonce a day , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Avandia 8 mg once a day ,Prilosec 20 mg once a day , and NPH insulin 50 mg subcu b.i.d.SOCIAL HISTORY:He lives with his wife , has adult children.FAMILY HISTORY:Sister with diabetes mellitus and CAD.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:On admission , the patient was afebrile 97.5 , pulse of 84 ,systolic blood pressure was noted to be 137 , respiratory rate 20 ,and 95% on room air , was found to be hard of hearing , butotherwise in no apparent distress. Lungs were CTAB with nowheezes. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2.No S3 or S4. JVP was difficult to assess and no audible murmurs ,had truncal obesity on abdominal exam with ventral hernia.Nontender and active bowel sounds. Extremities had edema twotimes the size of the left lower extremity , 20 x 10 cm patch ofpink erythematous and induration of warmth over the right knee ,exquisitely tender over the patellar with small area ofinduration over the right patella. Nontender long joint lines ,small effusions , and pain with passive range of motion over thepatellar area. Feet were clean without cracking , maceration , orulcers.PERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION:Creatinine of 2.3 , BUN of 74 , glucose of 119 , sodium andpotassium of 136 and 4.3. White cell count was 8.7 with normaldifferential , 78% polys , hematocrit 34.1 , and platelets 298 , 000.INR was 1.0. ESR was 98. Uric acid was noted to be normal.Synovial fluid did not show crystals and gram-stain was negative.LENI's , right lower extremity did not show DVT above the rightknee.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Musculoskeletal/ID/Rheum: This is right knee prepatellarbursitis versus cellulitis. The patient with plain film andx-ray , which did not show any large prepatellar bursal effusion.No other trauma or fracture to be seen on x-ray. The patient wasdoing well in-house , however , the erythema and pain did notrespond to IV vancomycin and p.o. levofloxacin at renal dosing ,and was thought by rheumatology who graciously consulted on thispatient to have a likely prepatellar bursitis. It is alsopossible this patient had a cellulitis overlying the prepatellararea , but there is no evidence of joint infection. Tap on11/7/05 of the prepatellar bursal fluid showed no crystals , nopolynuclear cells , and no organisms were seen. Given this ,again , prepatellar bursitis is the primary diagnosis and the paindid slowly resolve while inhouse. The patient was able to bendthe knee and do weightbearing , although with pain prior todischarge without any evidence of systemic infection or sepsis.Blood cultures on admission were no growth. Prior to discharge ,Rheumatology suggested starting colchicine 0.6 mg b.i.d. for twodays followed by 0.6 mg daily for two days , followed by everyother day 0.6 mg for one week. Follow up with Wamai Hospitalas an outpatient , to follow up prepatellar bursitis and to checkuric acid , although normal on admission at this time. Thepatient was stable without any signs of joint infection orspreading fascial infection or worsening cellulitis. Thepatient will also be started on Keflex despite the fact that hedid not respond to antibiotics , and this is likely a prepatellarbursitis. In case , it is small component of cellulitis , thepatient will be kept on 10 days of p.o. Keflex at renal dose 500mg b.i.d. as an outpatient and will be followed by Way Oa Hospital in the future.2. Diabetes mellitus: The patient was initially not placed onhome NPH 50 mg b.i.d. and required increased NovoLog slidingscale to 10 standing q.a.c. plus sliding scale. However , afteraddition of 50 mg b.i.d. , NPH as per patient's home dose , thepatient's blood sugars ranged from 90s to 180s , which is farimproved from prior sugars in the 300s on admission. The patientwill continue on home dose NPH insulin with a NovoLog slidingscale. Also will continue oral Avandia.3. Cardiovascular: There were no active issues on thisadmission.4. Pain: The patient had approximately two to three times 25 mgof oxycodone p.r.n. for pain. This will be continued for severaldays as needed for pain on discharge.5. Vascular: The patient with full LENI did not show anythrombus in the right lower extremity on LENI.6. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency , whichlooks like acute on chronic given for unknown reasons , thepatient was initially placed on Lasix b.i.d. , but was taken downto 80 mg once a day for lower extremity edema and swelling , givencreatinine of approximately 1.9 to 2.2. Discharge creatinine was2.0. This will be followed up by Villerich Deo Hospital as anoutpatient. It seems that this is chronic renal insufficiencyfrom long-standing diabetes without a severe acute component.The patient was on prophylactic Lovenox and Nexium whilein-house.DISPOSITION:Home on oral Keflex and colchicine as noted above.DIET ON DISCHARGE:Diabetic diet , 2 , 100 calorie per day , a low saturated fat , andlow-cholesterol diet.

Thepatient is also status post stenting of the left anteriordescending artery in September , 1996. After that time , the patientcontinued to have chest pain , although with decreased frequency andintensity. The patient did receive Ticlid for six to eight weeksfollowing the stenting.The patient presented with increased frequency and duration of hischest and epigastric pain. The patient denied shortness of breath ,orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , diaphoresis , nausea orvomiting.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,hypertension , hyperlipidemia , paroxysmalatrial fibrillation in 1982 , osteoarthritis and diet controlleddiabetes mellitus.ALLERGIES: Amoxicillin , which gives him arthritis.MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.;Imdur 120 milligrams p.o. q.a.m. and 60 milligramsp.o. q.p.m.; Cozaar 100 milligrams p.o. q.a.m.; Atenolol 50milligrams p.o. q.d.; Norvasc 5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has no smoking history and rarelydrinks alcohol.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Sclerae are anicteric. Oropharynx withoutlesions. Carotids 2+ without bruits. Theneck is supple. The lungs are clear to auscultation.Cardiovascular examination is a regular rate and rhythm with an S4.Normal S1/S2. Abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended , withnormal active bowel sounds. Extremities are without edema.Dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse and femoral pulsesare 2+ bilaterally without bruits in the femoral arteries.Neurological examination is without gross focal abnormality.LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 9.8 , hematocrit 40.8.Glucose 188 , creatinine 1.8. CK 40.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Servicefor management and evaluation of his angina. Heunderwent cardiac catheterization on June , 1997 , demonstrating90% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis , 99% diagonalone ostial stenosis; circumflex was okay. The right coronaryartery had a mid stenosis of 50%. The patient arrived in theCatheterization Lab with mild angina on 200 micrograms per minuteof intravenous nitroglycerin. Post catheterization , the patientdeveloped 5/10 chest pain with an increasing pulmonary capillarywedge pressure to 40 and D-waves of 52. Increasing thenitroglycerin led to resolution of these changes. The patient hadintra-aortic balloon pump placed via the right femoral artery withreturn of the wedge to approximately a mean of 6 and his pain wasrelieved. The patient returned to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unitwhere he underwent aggressive heart rate and blood pressurecontrol. He was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery and taken to theOperating Room on October , 1997 , for coronary artery bypassgrafting times three as described above. The patient wastransferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Electrocardiogramremained unchanged. He was extubated without difficulty. Theintra-aortic balloon pump was removed. The patient was noted tohave slight confusion on postoperative day number one and two.Lopressor was restarted and the patient was gently diuresed. Hischest tubes were discontinued. On postoperative day number three ,the patient was noted to be slightly more confused with left facialdroop and aphasia that resolved with mild left lid lag in the earlyafternoon. The patient was evaluated by Neurology. A head CT scanwas performed , demonstrating no hemorrhage or acute stroke. Therewas a small left cerebellar hemisphere lesion that was believed tobe consistent with a lesion that was greater than 24 hours old.The patient , however , became progressively encephalopathic. Thepatient underwent an echocardiogram and carotid studies , whichdemonstrated no evidence of embolic source. The patient'sexpressive aphasia and facial weakness , however , recurred. Thepatient again underwent head CT scan , demonstrating acute rightparietal infarction that appeared cortically based. Given therecent intra-aortic balloon pump placement , the aorta could not beruled out as a source for embolus. Therefore , heparin was started ,as was Coumadin. The goal INR is 2 to 3. Also the patient had ahistory of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , and although had noevidence of atrial fibrillation , there was concern over potentialcardiac source for embolization. The patient's aphasia and leftfacial droop improved steadily. He was evaluated by the Speech andSwallowing Service. He had no difficulty with swallowing; however ,it was felt that he would benefit from language therapy in additionto his physical therapy and occupational therapy. The remainder ofthe patient's course was uncomplicated from a cardiac standpoint.His chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated very small leftsided effusion without any significant failure.DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to rehabilitationfor reconditioning and intensive speech , physicaltherapy and occupational therapy. He will follow-up with Data Medical CenterCardiology in one to two weeks. He will follow-up with Dr. Bostin four to six weeks. He will receive physical therapy ,occupational therapy and speech therapy. He must also follow-upwith his internist , as he has been requiring a sliding scaleinsulin dosing , with previously diet controlled diabetes.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3 one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h.p.r.n. pain; Colace 100 milligrams p.o.t.i.d.; sliding scale insulin; Lopressor 50 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.;Coumadin , with goal INR of 2-3 , to be dosed q.d. after checking aprothrombin time.Dictated By: ALEC MACKEDANZ , M.D. FP11Attending: MILES Q.

Prostate cancer diagnosed September 1997; status post radiationtherapy.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old manwithout prior cardiac history. He hascardiac risk factors including possible hypertension , and possiblehistory of hypercholesterolemia. The patient has had a history ofatypical chest pain , including a cardiac workup in the past with anechocardiogram in 1995 showing concentric left ventricularhypertrophy , asymmetric septal hypertrophy. He had a normalejection fraction at this time. In October of 1997 , he had anexercise tolerance test at which time he went eight minutes , with amaximal heart rate of 151 , maximal blood pressure 226/90 , and noelectrocardiogram changes. At 2 p.m. on the day of admission hedeveloped substernal chest pain with a crushing tightness ,radiating to both shoulders and his jaw. He was not short ofbreath. He experiences pain on and off through the afternoon ,although the pain was never completely gone. At 6 p.m. , he becameacutely worse , and at that time called the EMT and was brought toNama Emergency Department. Within theEmergency Department , the patient was noted to have ST elevationsin the inferior leads. He was enrolled in the NPA/TPA trial.Infusion was begun at 8:15. The patient was given Lopressor ,oxygen , morphine , aspirin , and heparin. He did not drop hispressure with sublingual nitroglycerin.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history includes prostatecancer in September 1997 , status post XRT , as wellas a possible transient ischemic attack in 1990.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS: Medications included Zantac p.r.n.FAMILY HISTORY: Family history was negative for coronary arterydisease.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married with three children. Hedenies any tobacco or alcohol use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admissiondemonstrated a well-appearing black male inno acute distress. Vital signs were a heart rate of 48 , bloodpressure 83/30 in the Emergency Department , he was afebrile , withoxygen saturation level 99 percent on two liters. HEENTexamination , the oropharynx is benign , he had a left facial droop.The neck was supple , 2+ carotids without bruit. Jugular venousdistention was normal. The chest was clear to auscultationbilaterally. The heart had a regular bradycardic rhythm with a 2/6systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,non-distended , positive bowel sounds , no organomegaly. Theextremities were warm and well-perfused , no clubbing , cyanosis oredema , trace distal pulses. Neurologically , he was alert andoriented x three , cranial nerves 2 through 12 are grossly intactexcept for a left facial droop. Motor and sensory were grosslyintact.ADMISSION LABORATORY: Admission labs showed a sodium of 144 ,potassium 4.2 , chloride 108 , bicarbonate of22 , BUN 16 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 136. White count was 8 with ahematocrit of 35 , platelets were 239 , CK was 276 with an MB of 0.8.Troponin on admission was 0.0. INR was 1.0 , partial thromboplastintime was 22.6. The patient's first electrocardiogram in theEmergency Department showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 withfirst-degree AV block , axis of 56 degrees. He had ST elevations of4 millimeters in leads 3 and aVF , 3 millimeters in 2 , ST depression0.5 to 3 millimeters V2 through V5 , 1 and aVL. Chest x-ray did notshowed acute disease in the Emergency Department.HOSPITAL COURSE: Within the Emergency Department , the patientinitially had resolution of his electrocardiogramchanges , but had persistent jaw pain , remaining at 5/10. He wastaken to catheterization , which demonstrated a mid right coronaryartery lesion of approximately 95 percent with a clot , but withTIMI-III flow. No intervention was done at that time. The patientinitially required vigorous intravenous hydration to maintain goodblood pressure , but remained essentially stable and pain-free. Hehad a drop in hematocrit from 35 on admission to 28 after hiscatheterization secondary to blood loss of the right femoral triplelumen site placed in the Emergency Ward prior to tPA , blood loss atcatheterization , small hematoma and dilution. He was given twounits of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in hishematocrit. The patient was then transferred to the Floor , wherehe maintained his good course. He had no postcatheterization orpost myocardial infarction chest pain. The decision was then madeto take the patient back to the Catheterization Laboratory to havepercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting ofthis lesion , and to see if it continued to persist.Dictated By: ISIDRO MIJARES , M.D. OJ18Attending: SANDY GEORGE KLOSE , M.D. EB9  PH067/5435Batch: 76607 Index No. W4DVX87EDV D: 4/26/97T: 10/28/97

Total bypasstime was 101 minutes , total crossclamp time was 63 minutes. Intraoperatively ,the patient was found to have a calcified trileafletaortic valve. The patient came off bypass without incident , was brought to theIntensive Care Unit on 3 mcg of epinephrine and insulin andPrecedex. The patient did well and was brought up in stablecondition in normal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively , the patientwas extubated and the Electrophysiology Service was consulted toevaluate his internal pacemaker which was reprogrammed andfunctioning well. The patient continued to require vigorousdiuresis with a Lasix drip. He was extubated on postoperative day #1 withoutincident. The patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit onpostoperative day 5. The patient experienced some postoperativetachycardia and his beta-blocker was increased with good result.He was also found to have a positive urinary tract infection andwas started on ciprofloxacin for a total of five days. Thepatient at one point required 5 liters of nasal cannula to gethis saturations in the 90s. He did continue to requireintravenous Lasix but had weaned Lasix drip and had intermittentboluses of 40 mg IV to promote diuresis with good result.

Her physical exam was significant for anelevated JVP , lower extremity edema , pulmonary rales , laterally displacedPMI , and S3 gallop , all consistent with heart failure. Even though thepatient had cardiolmegaly on CXR from 2004 , her LVEF was about 60% ,suggesting a recent development of CHF. Her EKG showed NSR with new LBBB ,and no QW. Due to her multiple atherosclerotic risk factors , new LBBB ,and evidence of neuropathy , the initial impression was that she had arecent ischemic event. Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negativeduring her first 24 hours stay. She had a stress MIBI showing noscars or evidence of reversible ischemia with a calculated EF of 23%. AnEcho showed dilated LV , with globaly reduced LE function and near normalpulmonary pressures , suggestive of dilated cardiomaypathy. Extensiveinterviewing of the patinet was negative for other possible etiologies ofHF , TSH and A1C were normal , and and the cause of her dilated CMPremained undifined. she was diuresed to a dry weight of 57Kg , respondedwell to PO Lasix ( 40-60mg ) , treated also with Toprol XL 25mg , andSpironolactone 12.5mg. Her symptos completely resolved both at rest andwith gentle ambulation. One can argue toward evaluating her coronarayarteries either by cath or CTA to exclude balanced ischemia. Howeverconsidering her age , no changed in EKGs , negative MIBI , and an Echo withglobaly reduced EF , we choose to medicaly treat her. she will beevaluated in the future for AICD/CRT , then a cath can also be considered.She will follow up with Dr. Rafael Abeita .ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1.

Upper GI bleed from a gastric ulcer , anemia , GERD ,hypertension , diabetes type 2 , and history of buttock cellulitis.BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-oldmale , history of CAD status post MI and CABG , upper GI bleed fromgastric ulcer admitted for failure to thrive , nausea and vomitingand chronic abdominal discomfort. The patient most recently wasadmitted on 1/26/2006 for upper GI bleed from a gastric ulcer ,which was cauterized on EGD during that admission , however ,without any biopsy. Unfortunately , he was then discharged oniron supplementation , told to avoid aspirin and alcohol in set upwith a followup EGD in 3 months , however , since then the patienthas had persistent nausea and vomiting combined with burping andinability to tolerate p.o. , especially solids. His vomit hasbeen nonbloody yellow. He also reports a 20 pound weight lossover the last two months. He describes a chronic epigastricdiscomfort over the time , which is more of a "hunger feeling thenan acute pain". Denies any change in bowel movements includinghematochezia although he has chronic black colored stools , whichhe attributes to his iron supplementation. He reports weightloss. He reported a weight loss to his PCP who sent him to theED for further evaluation of this abdominal pain with a suspicionof GI bleeding. In the ED , he only had minimally guaiac positivestool , however right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed multiplehepatic lesions. The patient was then admitted for inability totolerate p.o. and the concurrent workup of cancer.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: On admission , the patient hadstable vital signs with a temperature of 98.1 , pulse of 57 , bloodpressure 158/72 , respirating 16 with an oxygenation of 96% onroom air. He was in no apparent distress , alert and oriented x3.He had a flat JVP. He had a sternal scar. He had regular rateand rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops.His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomenwas slightly obese. It was soft with positive bowel sounds. Hehad mild discomfort to deep palpation but no tenderness , nopalpable hepatosplenomegaly but questionable dullness topercussion at the left final intercostal space in the midaxillary line. His extremities were without edema with goodpulses.PERTINENT LABS: Chemistry panel was unremarkable. His CBC wasunremarkable as well. He had except for low hematocrit of 31.2.His LFTs were unremarkable except for mildly elevated , AST at 31.As mentioned above , he had right upper quadrant ultrasound ,which showed multiple hepatic lesions.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: GI/Onc: The patient was admittedwith nausea , vomiting and inability to tolerate p.o. , along witha weight loss. He had an emergency room right upper quadrantultrasound with hepatic lesions , which was highly suspicious ofmalignancy and he was thus admitted for inability to toleratep.o. and a concurrent workup of his hepatic lesions formalignancy. He had an abdominal CT , which confirmed that therewas a gastric mass and hepatic lesions with surroundinglymphadenopathy. He subsequently had an EGD , which revealed afungating mass which was later confirmed on biopsy to be invasiveadenocarcinoma , poorly differentiated. He was then referred tooncology who informed the patient of his diagnosis with hisfamily. The patient decided to undergo chemotherapy with fullFOX. He was then placed with the Port-A-Cath access on2/2/2006 and he received his full FOX on 1/9/2006 withoutincident. Throughout he was controlled on antiemetics. He wascontinued on his outpatient dose of Nexium as before NSAIDS andaspirin were avoided.Heme: The patient had a stable hematocrit on admission. Hehowever given his history of GI bleeding , was closely watched andwas transfused for goal hematocrit above 28. He only receivedone unit of packed red blood cells on 1/30/2006 as noted. Thepatient received an EGD with biopsy of his of his lesion on1/29/2006 .  There was some problem with controlling his bleedingpostbiopsy surgery and interventional radiology were aware ofthis. He was closely monitored for any hematocrit drop.Fortunately , his hematocrit remained stable and he did notrequire any acute intervention. He did receive some p.o. vitaminK intermittently for his elevated INR of 1.5.Musculoskeletal: The patient did complain of his spine pain. Hesays this pain however has been chronic throughout the years. Hedid have a spinal MRI , which did not show any evidence ofmetastatic disease or cord compression. It did reveal only milddegenerative joint disease.Cardiovascular: The patient was maintained on his homemedications for his hypertension , coronary artery disease andhistory of MI. There were no acute issues during this hospitalstay.Endocrine: For his diabetes , the patient was held off his oralhypoglycemics and put on an insulin sliding scale as well as astanding NPH insulin dose. For his hypercholesterolemia , he wascontinued on his home dose of Vytorin , which was administered asseparate Zetia and Zocor.Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: Given his poor inability totolerate p.o. , he was given IV fluids on admission. His diet wasadvanced to clears and intermittently he was held n.p.o. forprocedures and for his episode of bleeding status post hisbiopsy. However , he was then successfully advanced on his diet.Nutrition was consulted and did leave recs for possible TPNadministration. If the patient should not be able to toleratep.o. in the long run however , he is doing well and TPN will beheld off for now.Prophylaxis: The patient is prophylaxed on a PPI on his homedose as well as Lovenox. The patient is full code.Key features of physical exam at discharge , the patient remainsin stable condition. His physical exam is unchanged.DISPOSITION AND FOLLOW UP TESTS: The patient will be dischargedhome with VNA as well as with an infusion pump to administeroutpatient chemotherapy of 5-FU. The patient should follow upwith his primary care provider Dr. Rydelek and as well as hisoncologist , Dr. Moyers . He will continue on his chemotherapyprotocol per Dr. Thamphia . His p.o. intake should be monitored and hepotentially should have an appointment with outpatient nutritionto evaluate whether TPN should be started or not. He shouldcontinue on his antiemetics , his pain control and a bowelregimen.eScription document: 7-9225279 HFFocusDictated By: BLAS , JEROMYAttending: FALCIONI , TEDDYDictation ID 1045647D: 7/12/06T: 10/17/06

This is consistent with her previoussensation that she gets when her heart rate increases with atrialflutter. She also noted some jaw soreness , which she commonlyfeels with increased heart rate. At the time , she was seen in thehospital , she was asymptomatic. She also gets some pain underher breasts bilaterally when her heart rate increased. Shedenies any orthopnea and no leg swelling or PND. Her exercise islimited by claudication , which worsens in cold weather. Alsowhen she gets up quickly , she continues to feel lightheaded butno loss of consciousness. She is steady on her feet.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fever , some nausea today , no vomiting , andlittle bit of diarrhea for one week but nonbloody. She has ahistory of colitis. No dysuria. No hematuria. No new jointpains.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for hypertension , sick sinussyndrome with bradycardia status post a pacemaker placement in1986. She has had high cholesterol. She has coronary arterydisease status post an MI in 1992 , a CABG in 1992 , LIMA to LAD ,SVG to PDA. She has also had PCI x2. She has peripheralvascular disease. She is status post angioplasty. She hasdiabetes , status post cholecystectomy , status post pelvic floorsuspension x2 , status post appendectomy and status post lysis ofadhesions for bowel obstruction and colitis.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Digoxin 0.125 mg daily , lisinopril 5mg daily , Pravachol 20 mg each night , diltiazem XR 360 mg daily ,Plavix 75 mg daily , Asacol 1200 mg twice daily , cilostazol 50 mgtwice daily , Toprol-XL 300 mg daily , Coumadin 2 mg daily ,metformin 500 mg twice daily , nitroglycerin , lorazepam 0.25 mg inthe morning and midday and then 0.5 mg at night , she does nottake aspirin.ALLERGIES: She has allergies to sulfa , which cause a rash ,penicillin causes angioedema , tetracycline , and H2blockers.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. She has a 40+ packyear of smoking , quit in 1986. No drinking currently but has inthe past.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 96.1 , pulse 82 ,blood pressure 130/60 , respiratory rate 24 and saturating 92% on3 liters. General: She is in no acute distress , appears statedage. HEENT: She is anisocoria , left greater than right ,reactive to light. Neck is supple. JVP is 6 cm.Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , nomurmurs , rubs or gallops. Respiratory: She has crackles at thebases. Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds , soft , nontender , andnondistended. Extremities: Warm and dry , no edema , and 1+distal pulses. She is alert and oriented x3.Her EKG shows V pacing with underlined flutter. Labs werenotable for a creatinine of 0.8 , and a hematocrit of 29.2. CKand troponins were negative. Studies performed during heradmission , chest x-ray showed atelectasis. An echo prior toadmission showed mildly reduced EF , hypokinetic septum , LAE ,dilated RA , and normal AR , 3+ MR , trace PR. A MIBI performedduring this admission showed moderate aortic ischemia in theanterior wall and in the diagonal territory. Chest x-ray on10/2/2006 , later on admission showed improved pulmonary edema ,slightly increased size of small effusions , and no infiltrate.She had a TEE , which showed no clot and a mild-to-moderatedecreased EF. She had a TTE with bubble study on 7/5/2006 ,which showed no shunt , and an EF of 45%. She had PFTs , whichshowed a mixed restrictive and obstructive picture that wasmild-to-moderate in severity.HOSPITAL COURSE:Cardiovascular:1. Rhythm: Ms. Prestage has a long history of atrial flutter ,which has been poorly controlled despite extremely high doses ofbeta-blockers , diltiazem , and digoxin. She underwent a TEE andDC cardioversion and remained out of atrial flutter , and V pacedat 60 beats per minute for remainder of her admission.2. Ischemia: She has a significant history of coronary arterydisease. After her DC cardioversion , she continued to complainof shortness of breath and was found to be hypoxic on room airwhich we discussed below. She did have the positive MIBI asdiscussed above , but given her significant previousinterventions , the thought was to continue to manage hermedically since this would not likely be amenable to intervention.3. Pump: In 2002 , she had an EF of 45 to 55%. She was not onany signs of decompensated CHF , although her shortness of breathdid improve marginally with some gentle diuresis. A repeat TTEon 7/5/2006 showed an EF of 45% , which was relatively unchangedfrom 2002.Respiratory: Status post her cardioversion , she was found to besaturating in the mid 80s on room air and desaturating further onambulation. Pulmonary was consulted and a room air ABG wasobtained that showed pH 7.48 , pCO2 33 , and pO2 52. She had noevidence of carbon monoxide , no methemoglobinemia. Her PFTs wereas described above. With a gentle diuresis and with moreambulation , she improved. It is unclear why she had this transienthypoxemia. Pulmonary recommended a trial of Advair and Spiriva ,if these made her feel better to continue these , if not then shecould stop them. Also mentioned , she underwent a bubble studywhich showed no shunt. In sum , there was a question as to whether this may berelated to atelectasis plus some underlyingCOPD plus her underlying small effusion.

He has has asymptomatic aorticstenosis. He also has known coronary artery disease havingundergone angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronaryartery in 1991. Catheterization at that time demonstrated an 80%left anterior descending lesion and a 60% first diagonal lesion.He has had a 4-5 year history of shortness of breath diagnosed withmild aortic stenosis and followed clinically. In the planningprocess for knee surgery , serial echocardiograms were performedshowing decreased aortic valve area and decreasing ejectionfraction. Most recent echocardiogram shows moderate to severeaortic stenosis and has been suggested to have the valve replacedbefore undergoing knee surgery. The patient was admitted forelective aortic valve replacement prior to knee surgery. He has ahistory of class II heart failure , slight limitation of physicalactivity. He is in normal sinus rhythm.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , insulin dependent diabetesmellitus , hypercholesterolemia , degenerativejoint disease of the bilateral knees , left greater than right ,status post left total knee replacement in 1994 with persistentsymptoms to undergo surgery for his knee , benign prostatichypertrophy , decreasing hearing , left greater than right.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: A total knee replacement in 1994 ,appendectomy in the 1960s.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Diltiazem ER 180 mg once a day , Isordil30 mg three times a day , enteric coatedaspirin 325 mg once a day , Zocor 10 mg once a day , Cozaar 25 mgonce a day , Humulin N 30 units in the morning and 14 units in theevening.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate 80 and regular.HEENT: Dentition is without evidence ofinfection.

EKG shows normalsinus rhythm at 88. Chest x-ray is clear.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent coronary arteriography onAugust , 2002 at Wi Wirolllen Hospital .This examination showed a right dominant system with a diffuse 40%lesion of the left main , discrete 50% lesion of his proximal leftanterior descending coronary artery , a 70% lesion of his mid leftanterior descending artery with an 80% distal lesion. He also hadan 80% lesion of his first diagonal and a diffuse 50% proximallesion of the same vessel , 70% ostial lesion of his circumflex andan eccentric 45% lesion of his right coronary artery with a 70%lesion in his large left ventricular branch. The patient went tothe operating room on August , 2002 where he underwent an aorticvalve replacement with a #23 Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valveand a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a left internalmammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery ,saphenous vein graft to the first marginal and saphenous vein graftto the posterior left ventricular branch. His intraoperativecourse was uneventful. He was seen in consultation by the DiabeticManagement Service for blood sugar control and initiation into thePortland Protocol for intravenous insulin. His postoperativecourse was complicated by an episode of rapid atrial fibrillationwhich was treated with replacement of his electrolytes andinitiation of Lopressor therapy and also mild anemia that wasmonitored and addressed with diuresis for fluid overload. Hispostoperative course was uneventful. He continued to requirediuresis for pleural effusion. Chest x-ray on dischargedemonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions.

Chemistries and cellcounts of ascitic fluid as described above in the laboratorysection.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 63-year-old man with history ofend-stage renal disease - on hemodialysis , coronary arterydisease , diabetes , severe peripheral vascular disease status postbilateral knee amputations , who presented with two months ofworsening ascites of unclear etiology. His hospital course byproblem is as follows:1. Gastrointestinal: The patient underwent a therapeuticparacentesis with ascites fluid revealing chemistries with totalprotein greater than 2.5 and serum ascites albumin gradientgreater than 1.1 consistent with a transudative ascites , likelydue to volume overload with resultant right heart failure.Ascites had 460 white blood cells with 20% polys. Therefore , itwas not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.Ascitic fluids were negative for growth of bacteria and cytologyof the ascitic fluids identified no malignant cells. Afterconsultation with the cardiology service , it was concluded thatthe ascites was due to massive volume overload , and therefore thepatient should undergo reduction of volume throughultrafiltration at dialysis. This process was begun as aninpatient by the renal service. While the patient was aninpatient , efforts to remove fluid was complicated bydevelopment of hypotension during dialysis aswell as by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular responsewith heart rates up to the 140s. Due to the difficulties withremoving fluid at dialysis , the patient was offered the option ofundergoing ultrafiltration by CVVH or an ultrafiltration machine ,but the patient and the family declined to participate in suchcare. It should also be noted that despite our efforts , thepatient was not compliant with fluid restrictions that were putinto place in the patient's diet order , therefore also making itdifficult to treat the patient's volume overload. The patientwas discharged with the plan to continue ultrafiltration at outpatientdialysis in an attempt to continue to remove fluid and reduce thepatient's volume overload. This plan was communicated by theattending renal , Dr. Simon Esbrandt , to the patient's outpatient renalattending , Dr. Archie Chhum .2. Renal: As described above , the patient has end-stage renaldisease - on hemodialysis. As described above , ultrafiltrationwas attempted at hemodialysis to remove as much fluid as possibleand to reduce the patient's volume overloaded state.Ultrafiltration should be continued as an outpatient to continueto attempt to counteract the patient's volume overload.3. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , the patient has a history ofcoronary artery disease status post CABG and stent , but his usualaspirin and Plavix were initially held given that surgicalrevision of his right below-the-knee amputation had been planned.However , after discussion with the patient's vascular surgeon ,Dr. Herb Piecuch , it was decided that the patient's volumeoverload should be corrected prior to his undergoing surgicalrevision of his right leg. Therefore , aspirin and Plavix wererestarted on 11/16/2007 .  Pump: The patient has evidence ofright heart failure by echocardiogram. On physical exam and asdescribed above , this is likely a consequence of the patient'svolume overload. Again , as described above , volume was removedthrough ultrafiltration at dialysis. Rhythm: The patient has ahistory of atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated , likelyfor fear of noncompliance. The patient was in normal sinusrhythm for the majority of this admission but on 1/8/2007 , thepatient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular withrates to the 120s to 140s. However , the patient refused toaccept monitoring on cardiac telemetry and also refused tocooperate with the administration of intravenous medications forheart rate control. Therefore , the patient's dose of oralLopressor was slowly titrated upward as tolerated by his bloodpressures , but on discharge his rate remained in the low 100s andwere not optimally controlled. However , the patient refusedfurther management of his atrial fibrillation , and it wastherefore decided that this should be managed as an outpatientwith continued slow readjustment of his oral beta-blockerregimen.4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on his home insulinregimen and fingersticks were monitored on a q.a.c. and nightlybasis with adequate control of blood sugars.5. Vascular: As described above , the patient has a rightbelow-the-knee amputation , which need surgical revision. Asdescribed above , after discussion with the patient's vascularsurgeon , Dr. Mel Bierut , it was decided that the patient'ssurgical revision of his right leg would be addressed after hisissues with volume overload are resolved.6. Infectious disease: It was noted that the patient has as alikely paronychia of his left index finger. Plain films wereobtained , which did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. Ahand surgery consult was obtained , and it was noted that therewere no vascular issues with his left hand and that no urgentsurgical debridement of the left finger was necessary. Thepatient was treated with oral levofloxacin and will continuetaking levofloxacin for a total of 3-week course to end on6/11/2007 .  Oxycodone was administered for pain control of hisleft finger as well as for pain control of his right leg.Prophylaxis , the patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin forDVT prophylaxis and placed on Nexium for GI prophylaxis.The patient was full code during this admission.PHYSICIAN FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient has a followup appointmentwith his vascular surgeon , Dr. Huey Lamond , on 10/26/2007 at2:30 p.m. , phone number 178-843-9703. The patient should callhis doctor his primary care physician , Dr. Jamal Gehlert ,telephone #204-180-5657 , for appointment in two to three weeks.The patient will continue dialysis at Gentville under thedirection of Dr. Alphonso Berwald on a Monday , Wednesday , Fridayschedule. This patient should complete a total of 14-day courseof levofloxacin to end on 6/11/2007 for his left fourth fingerparonychia/skin infection. The patient's beta-blocker should betitrated upwards as tolerated by blood pressure for bettercontrol of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. As describedabove , ultrafiltration should be used during dialysis to removetotal body volume.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:1. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth daily.2. PhosLo 1334 mg by mouth q.a.c.3.

COPD.2. Arrhythmia.3. AVNRT/SVT.CHIEF COMPLAINT:On admission was shortness of breath and fever.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:This is a 73-year-old male with COPD , hypertension , chronic renalinsufficiency , CHF , with ejection fraction of 60% , pulmonaryhypertension , and arrhythmias who was discharged on 5/10/05 butreturned later in the evening complaining of worsening shortnessof breath and fevers at home. On prior hospitalization , thepatient had presented on 10/10/05 with acute shortness of breathand hypertension with chest pain and was ruled out for MI and PE.In addition , he was treated for minor COPD exacerbation withsteroids and nebulizer but not antibiotics and was discharged on5/10/05 at baseline home O2 of 2 liters and was afebrile. Atpresentation on 9/30/05 , the patient noted worsening shortnessof breath with increasing oxygen needs and in the ED was found tohave a temperature of 102.4. On chest x-ray , the patient wasfound to have left lower lobe pneumonia that had not been notedon chest x-ray from 10/10/05 and on the PECT on 4/19/05 .  Thepatient was admitted on 9/30/05 for pneumonia and increasingoxygen requirements.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Past medical history is notable for a. fib with SVT not onCoumadin , hypertension , COPD with home oxygen at 2 liters ,hyperlipidemia , gout , coronary vascular disease , chronic renalinsufficiency , and type II diabetes controlled on diet.MEDICATIONS:His medications at time of admission included aspirin 81 mgdaily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d. , thepatient was on the prednisone taper , Hytrin 2 mg daily , Zocor 40mg q.h.s. , Flovent , Prilosec , and Atrovent.ALLERGIES:He has allergies to sulfa , lisinopril , and quinine causingplatelet deficiency.SOCIAL HISTORY:The patient had quit cigarette and denied any alcohol or illicitdrug use.FAMILY HISTORY:Noncontributory.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Physical exam at the time of admission was notable for atemperature of 101 , blood pressure 95/53 , oxygen saturation of86% on 2 liters , pulse of 96 , and respiratory rate of 24. Thepatient was noted to have crackles with left side being greaterthan right. His cardiovascular exam had normal S1 , S2 regularrate and rhythm with no rubs , murmurs or gallops. Hisextremities were notable for trace edema. Neurologically , he wasintact.LABORATORY DATA:His labs at time of admission was notable for a creatinine of1.7 , and a white cell count of 16 , he had a ABG with pH of 7.42 ,PaCO2 of 35 , PaO2 of 52 , and 89% oxygen saturation on 2 liters.His EKG showed T wave inversions in V2-V3 , flat V4 , borderlinefirst-degree AV block in sinus rhythm. Chest x-ray was notablefor left lower lobe pneumonia.ASSESSMENT:On assessment , this is a 73-year-old gentleman recentlydischarged for minor COPD flare , presenting with acute hypoxemialikely secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia with COPD.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Pulmonary:a. Hypoxia: The patient presented with acute and chronichypoxia. The patient initially required short term MICU stay fora BiPAP and was gradually weaned to facemask over 24 hours. Onday two of admission , he was weaned to 8 liters and wastransferred to the floor where his respiratory management wascontinued. On 10/4/05 , day 3 of hospitalization , the patienthad been weaned to 5 liters when he began coughing and abruptlydesaturated to 70% oxygen saturation with complaints of shortnessof breath and chest pain and required nonrebreather. The patienthad no EKG changes and a chest x-ray was unchanged from prior on9/30/05 .  The patient was given DuoNeb and chest PT. He wasstabilized and was able to be managed on the floor andtransitioned back to 8 liters. At time of discharge , he has beenweaned to 4 liters with 91-97% oxygen saturation. The patientdoes continue to desaturate with activities and requires furtherpulmonary rehabilitation including chest PT to remove mucusplugging noted on CT PE from earlier hospitalization in April .b. Pneumonia: The patient presented with left lower lobepneumonia. He was started on vancomycin , ceftriaxone , andazithromycin on 9/30/05 .  He had a sputum culture positive forMRSA and was therefore continued on vancomycin. He was brieflytransitioned to vancomycin with ceftazidime and Flagyl from8/14/05 to 08 , but was switched back to vancomycin withcefotaxime and azithromycin on 5/26/05 .  On day of discharge , hewill be leaving on vancomycin to complete two more days oftreatment for a total 10-day course. In addition , he will bedischarged on Levaquin for an additional seven-day course oftreatment for his pneumonia.c. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and wasmost recently discharged on 5/10/05 for mild COPD exacerbationtreated with DuoNeb and steroid taper. During this hospitalcourse , the patient continued on DuoNeb treatments as well as asteroid taper. Given his acute clinical course in thishospitalization , the patient did not have pulmonary function testperformed but with benefit from PFT studies as an outpatient. Attime of discharge , the patient is on 4 liters of oxygen and iscurrently on prednisone 5 mg which will be tapered to his homeregimen of prednisone 5 mg every other day.d. Hypertension: The patient had been noted to have a pulmonaryartery pressure in 2003 in the 60s but on this admission had anecho at time of admission that noted that his pulmonary arterypressure was now at 98 mmHg. The patient was followed by theInsmotho Erout Hospital Service to assess his pulmonary hypertension.The patient will be followed as an outpatient by theMalv Medical Center Service and will likely need right heartcatheterization to assess his right heart function as well as hispulmonary hypertension.2. Cardiovascular:a. Pump: The patient has congestive heart failure withdiastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction around 60% asnoted on an echo done on 9/30/05 .  The patient initially had hisLasix held due to his creatinine of 1.7 at time of admission.However , given his acute respiratory status , as well as hisincreasing edema during his hospital course , the patient wasagain aggressively diuresed for his CHF exacerbation with Lasix.At time of discharge , the patient still has trace edema and hiscreatinine has remained at his baseline of 1.1-1.2. The patientwill be discharged on his home Lasix regimen of 40 mg p.o.although he required IV Lasix on multiple occasions during hishospital course.b. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension.Overall , his systolic blood pressure remained in the range from110-130s. The patient was on Lopressor during his hospitalcourse and had no acute issues regarding his hypertension.c. Ischemia: The patient had been ruled out for MI with threesets of negative cardiac biomarkers. He was continued ontelemetry and remained on a regimen of aspirin , beta blockers , aswell as statin during this hospital course.d. Rate: The patient has a history of arrhythmias withparoxysmal atrial fibrillation and SVTs. At last admission on10/10/05 , the patient presented to the ED in SVT and hypotensiveand reverted back to normal sinus rhythm after one dose of IVLopressor. The patient was continued on Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d.during his hospital course with his DuoNeb treatments. Thepatient did occasionally have heart rate into the 140s consistentwith AV nodal reentry tachycardia. These incidences did not lastmore than 2 minutes and the patient was in general asymptomaticfrom these arrhythmias although did occasionally did complain ofsome shortness of breath on occasion during these periods ofarrhythmia. The patient is being continued on Lopressor 50 mgt.i.d.3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetesthat was under diet control as an outpatient with steroidtreatment for his COPD exacerbation. The patient did have hisblood glucose measured regularly three times a day and required aregular insulin sliding scale for his steroid-induced diabetes.With tapering of the steroids , the patient's blood glucose hasgenerally ranged between 100-150 and has required less insulin.While the patient is on steroids , we will continue to monitor hisblood glucose level and cover with insulin as needed. Thepatient will follow up with his primary care physician anddiscuss further his overall need for oral hypoglycemic agents.4. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renalinsufficiency with baseline creatinine around 1.1-1.2. Atinitial time of presentation , his creatinine was 1.7 and hisLasix had been held. However , the patient developed lowerextremity edema with shortness of breath and required Lasix forhis CHF exacerbation. His creatinine was followed closely duringhis hospital course and with Lasix diureses his creatinine didrise slowly to 1.4 , however , the benefits of diureses for CHFexacerbation outweighed his chronic renal insufficiency state.We would recommend that the patient follow up with his primarycare physician to monitor his renal state.5. FEN: During this hospital course , the patient's electrolyteswere monitored and repleted as needed. He had no acute issuesregarding his electrolytes or nutritional status. However , thepatient should continue on low-salt 2 g sodium diet as well aslimit his fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day.6. ID: The patient , at initial time of admission , had atemperature of 101.2 with white cell count as high as 16. He wasfound on chest x-ray to have a left lower lobe pneumonia and wasstarted on a antibiotic course as dictated above in pulmonary.The patient remained afebrile through the extent of this hospitalcourse while on the antibiotic therapy his sputum cultures werepositive for MRSA. At time of discharge , he will be continued onhis antibiotics on vancomycin for an additional two days for atotal of 10-day course and he will also be started on Levaquinfor a seven-day course. At time of discharge , the patientremained afebrile with his white cell count of 12.6. The patientis on prednisone , which can slightly his overall white cellcount. The patient is aware that if he had worsening of hissputum production as well as fevers , to seek medical attention.7. Heme: The patient had no active issues.8. GI: The patient had regular bowel movements during hishospital course and deferred bowel regimen.

Echocardiogram at that time revealed anejection fraction of 15% with global hypokinesis and 3+ mitralregurgitation. Catheterization revealed a right dominant systemwith clean coronary arteries. Exercise test at that time revealeda peak VO2 of 12.6 liters per kg per minute. IN October of 1997 , arepeat echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% withmoderate mitral regurgitation and significant left atrialdilatation. At that time , she received tailored therapy withDigoxin , diuretics and ACE inhibitors. In February of 1997 , shewas again hospitalized , this time with severe pancreatitisresulting in acute renal failure , hypotension and respiratoryfailure requiring intubation in the ICU.

She also hasa history of type II diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , and arecent herpes infection undergoing treatment with famciclovir whopresented with fever , chills , cough , and decreased p.o. intakefrom her nursing home with moderate hypotension to systolicpressures of 80 at the nursing home as well as oxygen saturationof 91% and on admission was found to have fever withoutneutropenia later diagnosed with an MSSA bacteremia and acomponent of acute on chronic renal failure.ALLERGIES:Fentanyl which caused GI intolerance , lisinopril which causescough , morphine which causes vomiting and Percocet which causesnausea and vomiting.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Temperature of 98.4 , a pulse of 100 , a BP of 143/64 with arespiratory rate of 20 with a O2 saturation of 100% on 3 liters.This is post 4 liters of IV fluids and six packs of platelets inthe emergency department at which point she had presented with afever to 101 with a initial systolic pressure of 146 over adiastolic of 91 that had dropped to 100 systolic. In the ED , shealso received vancomycin , levofloxacin , Flagyl , and ceftazidimeas well her PICC line which is present in the right upperextremity was pulled. A physical examination on admission wassignificant for tachycardia with an otherwise normal cardiac examwithout murmurs. Her respiratory exam showed decreased airmovement bilaterally with expiratory wheezes , however , noevidence of focal decrease in breath sounds. The abdominal examwas benign and the extremities showed erythema and induration atthe right former PICC site.ADMISSION LABORATORY:Significant for sodium of 131 , potassium of 4.9 , bicarbonate of20 , BUN and creatinine of 63/2.9 up from her baseline of 2. Herwhite blood cell count on admission was 4.5 with a hematocrit of23.7 and platelets of 20.Urinalysis showed 3+ protein , 1+ blood , 1+ bacteria and 2-4 whiteblood cells. An admission troponin was drawn and that was lessthan assay.Her EKG showed a sinus tachycardia with poor R-wave progressionand T-wave flattening in III and AVF. The chest x-ray wasperformed on admission that showed right-sided subsegmentalbasilar atelectasis with low lung volumes and a large cardiacsilhouette , but no definitive infiltrate or fusion.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:1/26/06: PICC line placement in the left upper extremity.1/26/06: CAT scan of the chest.2/3/06: Right upper extremity Doppler ultrasound and chestx-rays were performed on 6/20/06 , 03 .HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:ID: Based on blood culture results the patient had an MSSAbacteremia. She was initially treated with broad-spectrumantibiotics in the emergency department , however , this regimenwas tapered to initially include vancomycin as a single agent andthen further tapered to naphthalene but this was also taperedfinally to a regimen of Ancef dosed at 0.5 g IV q. 12h. Her lastpositive blood culture was on 2/10/06 and the Ancef should becontinued for 14 days thereafter setting an end date ofapproximately 5/2/06 .  She completed her course of famciclovirduring hospitalization and had no further evidence of genitalherpetic infection as well the urine culture and urinalysis datadescribed above showed yeast only and a Foley that had beenintermittently placed during the ED stay was discontinued , andthe patient remained asymptomatic for any further urinary tractinfection.Cardiovascular: Although the patient initially had transienthypertension believed to be secondary to infection and mildhypovolemia in the setting of diuretics and poor p.o. intakeprior to coming in. She was electively fluid resuscitated andactually went into mild hypervolemia as evidenced by chest x-rayfindings consistent with pulmonary edema initially. She wasthereafter diuresed as needed. During her hospitalization as herhemodynamic status stabilized her home blood pressure regimen wasreinstated. However , the following substitutions were made. Thehydrochlorothiazide was substituted with Lasix as her chronicrenal insufficiency dictated as well as her doxazosin dose wasincreased from 2 mg per day to 4 mg per day for better bloodpressure control. Her metoprolol dose , which was initially 100mg twice a day was changed the 62.5 mg four times daily , whichcan be converted as her blood pressure normalizes. Captopril andARBs were not used due to her history of allergies but additionalantihypertensive medications may be indicated if her pressureremains elevated. During the hospitalization , she had evidenceof nonsustained ventricular tachycardia asymptomatic ontelemetry , however , with alteration of the dose of Lopressorthere was no further evidence of this. At the time of discharge ,she was euvolemic from a pulmonary standpoint with mild lowerextremity edema. He discharge weight is 71.1 kilograms and herdaily weights should be followed and the Lasix titrated to remaineuvolemic. There was no evidence of ischemia during thehospitalization.Pulmonary: Although she presented with some shortness of breathand cough she did not continue to have any shortness of breath orcough during the hospitalization. Due to complaints of rightposterior rib pain during the hospitalization without evidence ofany skin or soft tissue abnormalities she underwent a CT scan ofthe chest on 5/5/06 , which showed a small right middle lobearea of consolidation favoring atelectasis but not impossible torepresent an early pneumonia. They also had tiny pleuraleffusions bilaterally as well as a tiny pericardial effusion , asmall calcified right apical node , and an enlarged left thyroidlobe with extension below the sternum. There was no evidence ofrib fracture or soft tissue abnormality on this CAT scan in thearea of concern. The pain caused by this symptom , which is stillunclear was treated with Lidoderm patch as well as Tylenol 650 mgp.o. q. 6h. standing with only modest relief. Other medicationsincluding other narcotics and NSAIDS were not used given herhistory of allergies as well as her thrombocytopenia. However ,these can be further evaluated in the outpatient setting.Hematology/oncology: The patient has a history of LGL NKlymphoma. There is no inpatient treatment for this disease;however , she received transfusions of packed red blood cells forher hematocrit less than 22 and platelet scales were set as 10.She also received GCSF during her hospitalization and shouldreceive her Neulasta in the outpatient setting. Prior todischarge a left upper extremity PICC line was placed on 5/5/06and confirmed on chest x-ray with its tip projecting over thesuperior vena cava.Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiencywith a component of acute renal failure at the time of admissionas her baseline creatinine increased from 2 to 2.9 , however , hercreatinine returned to her baseline with IV hydration initiallyand has remained at 1.9-2 stably prior to discharge.Endocrine: This patient has a history of type II diabetesinitially managed on Glucotrol in the outpatient setting. Shewas placed on NPH twice daily in the hospital and will bedischarged on 10 units twice daily with a insulin aspartatesliding scale prior to meals. Her blood glucose is not optimallycontrolled but more aggressive attempts to control her glucoseresulted in symptomatic hypoglycemia , therefore it was felt bestto air on the side of mildly elevated blood glucoses in the rangeof 150 to the low 200s in order to avoid transient hypoglycemia.The incidental finding of the left thyroid lobe enlargement onthe CT of the chest should be evaluated in the outpatient settingand this may be done in collaboration with the endocrine service ,however , the projection to the retrosternal space may precludemost evaluation.The patient was followed by physical therapy during thehospitalization and will continue to have physical therapy in theoutpatient setting. There were no complications during thehospitalization. Her physical examination at the time ofdischarge reveals a temperature of 97.2 , heart rate of 71-93 , ablood pressure of 130-150/57-80 , respiratory rate 20 , O2saturation of 96%-99% on room air with a lung exam showingminimal bibasilar crackles. A cardiac exam with regular rate andrhythm , S1 , S2 , no murmurs and abdominal exam showing obeseabdomen with ventral hernia but otherwise benign and lowerextremities with 1+ edema and nontender. A PICC line in the leftupper extremity and no erythema in the right upper extremity ,however , resolving induration and minimal tenderness. Herfingerstick glucose on the a.m. of discharge was 91. Herdischarge labs show a potassium of 4.2 , sodium of 136 , creatinineof 2 , magnesium of 1.7 , which is repleted. A white blood cellcount of 1 , hematocrit of 22.5 , platelets of 13 with 1% polys ,86% lymphs , and 4% monocytes.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every six hours. This should becontinued standing until her right chest wall pain diminishes ,Ben-Gay topical apply twice daily to back/right flank asdirected , Ancef 0.5 g IV q. 12h. should be continued until5/2/06 , Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily , Lasix 40 mg bymouth daily , insulin NPH 10 units subcutaneous b.i.d. , milk ofmagnesia 30 ml by mouth daily as needed for constipation ,Lopressor 62.5 mg by mouth four times daily , doxazosin 4 mg bymouth daily , Lidoderm 5% patch may be applied daily as needed forpain and it must have a 12 off period during the application ,insulin aspartate sliding scale pre-meal , Maalox tablets ,Spectazole one to two tablets by mouth every six hours as neededfor upset stomach and Protonix 40 mg by mouth daily.She will be discharged to the Worth Ri and thefinal results of the CT of the chest should be followed up. Dr.Bernard Winge , her primary oncologist , has been notified of herdischarge and will continue to follow her in the outpatientsetting.

The patient was initiallydiagnosed with cancer and presenting with lower back pain in5/15 when she was found to have lytic spinal and pelviclesions on MRI. Immunohistochemistry was most consistent withpancreatic cancer origin. She was admitted to the Laso in early October for cord compression andunderwent XRT and laminectomy by orthopedic surgeon by Dr.Kasey Mahaxay . During that admission , she was also noted to havea large pericardial effusion and underwent pericardial window.She was then discharged from Madei Coxcli Hospital on7/20/06 to rehab. At rehab , the patient was noted to havedifficulties expressing herself and word finding at 01:00 a.m. onthe day of admission. Prior to this episode , she had normalspeech and mental status and it is pertinent to note that on theday prior to admisison she had been seen in Oncology Clinic withDr. Randell Youkhana and hence was started on Zometa. The patientdenies any fevers , chills , neck stiffness or focal neurologicsymptoms. She was initially sent to Inh Hospital And Medical Center where anoncontrast CT scan was done and found to be negative for anacute process and was then admitted to General Service. At thatpoint , it had been over three hours since symptom onset and hercancer further precluded any possible TPA therapy. An MRI wasthen attempted to be obtained , however , the patient requiredintravenous conscious sedation to attempt the MRI secondary toagitation and anxiety. The patient received total of 2 mg ofVersed , 4.5 mg of IV Ativan and 2 mg of oral Ativan and severalattempts were made to facilitate the MRI. She was unable to sitfor MRI and was able to sit for a head CT with angiography. Asshe became more and more somnolent , it was felt that additionalsedation might necessitate intubation. The Anesthesia Servicecalled and pointed out that the Mas MRI machine isnot compatible with intubated patients. The patient was thentransferred to Down Camp for possible MRI withintubation. An LP at this time was also unable to be performedsecondary to her restlessness.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic adenocarcinoma , diabetesmellitus type 2 , history of sarcoid ( although never had abiopsy ) , status post cholecystectomy , status post laminectomy ofT9 , T11 and T12.MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Lorazepam 0.5 mg q.3 h. p.r.n.agitation , omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily , senna two tabs p.o.b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , metoprolol SR 50 mg p.o. daily ,ondansetron 8 mg p.o. b.i.d. , furosemide 20 mg p.o. daily ,insulin sliding scale , insulin Humalog 6 units a.c. , insulin NPH10 units b.i.d. , enoxaparin 40 mg daily subcutaneous , docusate100 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , Tylenol 650 mg q.6 h.p.r.n. pain.ALLERGIES: Penicillin with an unknown reaction.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature of 98 degrees , heart rate81 , blood pressure 107/51 , respirations 20 , sating 97% on 2 L.General exam showed a drowsy-feeling patient who was oriented x1( not for place or time ). HEENT exam shows pupils equal , roundand reactive with no photophobia. Neck exam showed a supple neckwith no lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary exam showed lungs clear toauscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed a JVP thatwas difficult to assess , heart rate showed a regular rate andrhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops , distal pulses were bilateraland 2+ and symmetric. Abdominal exam showed an obese abdomen , isnontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.Extremities exam showed extremities warm and well perfused.Neurologic exam showed the patient was alert and oriented only x1with 2+ patellar reflexes , 2+ ankle reflexes and 1+ brachialreflexes. The patient was poorly responsive to questions andcommands , hence a motor and sensory exam was unable to beobtained , however , the patient was moving all extremities.PERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION: Included a negative tox screen ,otherwise unremarkable. EKG showed sinus tach to 103 beats perminute , slightly low voltage. Chest x-ray showed cardiacenlargement without acute or active disease. Head CT showed noacute intracranial abnormality noted. Urinalysis showed traceleuk esterase , 5 to 10 white blood cells , 200 rbc's , however ,urine culture showed no growth.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Neurologic: The patient was initially admitted to themedical ICU for possible MRI with intubation. However , uponarrival , the patient was alert and oriented enough to refuse theMRI/MRA ( this was desired to rule out metastatic disease versusleptomeningeal disease ). Because she did not require she wasthen sent to the floor on 2/11/06 .  A full toxic metabolicworkup was obtained , which showed the ammonia levels withinnormal limits and nonreactive RPR , B12 assay that was actuallyslightly elevated and a TSH level of 10.6 ( a full thyroid panelwas also sent , which was pending at the time of discharge andshould be followed ). Given the concern for her slight pyuria onher UA and her altered mental status she was also given athree-day course of ciprofloxacin , however , her urinary culturewas negative. She presently , within the first 24 hours of herstay on the floor , her mental status improved remarkably and wasat her baseline. Hence , an MRI/MRA was not performed , as thiswould require the patient to undergo further sedation ( it wasfelt that her significant amount of benzodiazepines that weregiven previously only served to worsen her mental status ). An LPwas not indicated at this time since she had returned to herbaseline. An echo was ordered but was not performed secondary tothe fact that the patient had had a previous echo within the lastmonth , but was desired to rule the very small chance that she hadmarantic endocarditis with embolic phenomenon. At the time ofdischarge , the patient was at her neurologic baseline and wasalert and oriented x4. The likely source of her altered mentalstatus appears to be toxic metabolic multifactorial etiology ,including the possibility of Zometa effect , the urinary tractinfection and possible hypothyroidism.2. Onc: The patient has an appointment with Dr. Garrett Gavidia ofShiresy Medical Center Oncology on 2/10/06 to initiate Gemzarchemotherapy.3. Ortho: The patient has a followup appointment with Dr. Maronof Spi Medical Center Orthopedics on 8/9/06 forfurther followup.4. Endocrine: The patient will be discharged to rehab on aregimen of Lantus and sliding scale insulin. She should have herTFTs followed up as they are pending at this time for possibleinitiation of hormone replacement.5. ID: The patient finished a three-day course of ciprofloxacinfor possible urinary tract infection , however , her urinaryculture was negative.6. Cardiovascular: The patient was initially transferred onmetoprolol , however , her blood pressures have been wellcontrolled in-house. If her blood pressures are elevated atrehab , one could consider restarting her metoprolol.7. Disposition: The patient was in stable condition anddischarged back to rehab for further care.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: Temperature of 98.6 , bloodpressure of 110/60 , heart rate 98 , respirations 18 , sating 99% onroom air. General exam shows a slightly obese female who isalert and oriented x4 in no acute distress.

I advised to discuss herpregnancy with her psychiatrist and to be in contact should shehave any concerns. She reported that she always knows if sheneeds additional help and will be in contact with her doctor.4. Fetal well-being: Baseline and prenatal laboratories weresent on 4/19/05 .  Her blood type is B positive. Her antibodyscreen was negative. Her RPR was nonreactive. Her hepatitis Bsurface antigen is negative , rubella immune , gonorrhea andchlamydia are negative. She had an ultrasound done on the5/10/05 which revealed a singleton intrauterine gestation. Herplacenta was posterior and not previa. She had normal Dopplersand normal fetal survey. The fetal risks of uncontrolleddiabetes were discussed and she expressed that she understood allof these concerns.5. Cardiac. A baseline EKG was obtained which revealed normalsinus rhythm , normal axis , normal rate , however , her QT-intervalwas slightly prolonged at 491 msec. The upper limit of normal inwomen is 460. I briefly discussed this finding with the MedicineConsult Service and Cardiology Service who felt that this islikely attributable to her low potassium of 3.2. Therefore , highcontent potassium foods were encouraged and she will have arepeat EKG at her prenatal visit next week to evaluate forresolution of this prolonged QT. Of note , she reports that hermother had a congenital heart condition and experienced her firstheart attack at the age of 27 due to what she thought was anenlarged heart. Her mother ultimately died at the age of 56 froma heart attack. She reports aside from her mom who she does feelhad this condition since birth; no one in her family hasexperienced sudden cardiac death. She also has never experiencedpalpitations or chest pain.6. History of kidney stones. A urinalysis was sent whichrevealed 1-5 red blood cells and the urine culture showed 10 , 000of mixed flora.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:Given Ms. Bruechert strong desire to be discharged after only a dayof admission , she was discharged to home with the followinginstructions:She is to take her fingerstick blood sugars fasting and at onehour postprandial intervals and record them prior to herfollow-up appointment. She is also instructed to eat foods highin potassium and to call the office in an urgent manner shouldshe develop chest pain or palpitations. She has appointmentsscheduled for 6/6/04 with Dr. Gettys in special OB Clinic ,Dr. Weisse in Endocrine Clinic and Nutrition. She was givenprescriptions for NPH to take 14 units subcu a.m. and 14 unitssubcu at bedtime and Humalog 8 units prebreakfast , 6 unitsprelunch , and 8 units predinner. She is also advised to takeprenatal vitamins one tablet p.o. daily. She understands allthese follow up plans and has no concerns with her discharge atthis time.eScription document: 4-2371336 EMSDictated By: KAMINER , DELAttending: GRAUGHARD , LUCASDictation ID 0707807D: 5/10/05T: 5/10/05

During theprevious admission , she had been diuresed with a Lasix drip andthen started on amiodarone and Coumadin for a new paroxysmalatrial fibrillation. After discharge , she presented to NSCHCCardiology Clinic on 1/16/2006 with a jugular venous pressure at15 cm and severe bilateral lower extremity edema and a BNP of2500. The assessment in clinic was that she had been underdiuresed in the previous admission and therefore she was directlyadmitted to Poredtiesbarre General Hospital for reinitiation of aggressivediuresis. Of note , the patient had recently changed from Lasixto torsemide after the last discharge as her outpatientmedication. She endorsed worsened orthopnea , dyspnea onexertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as early satiety.She denied any chest pain or other anginal equivalents.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.

Metolazone p.r.n.ALLERGIES: Lisinopril and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives at home withher husband. She quit tobacco with rare alcohol use and nodrugs.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. There is no family history ofcardiac disease.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature was 98.9 , heartrate 70 , blood pressure 104/50 , respiratory rate of 20 , oxygensaturation 95% on room air. In general , the patient wascomfortable in no acute distress. HEENT , Pupils were equal ,round , and reactive. Oropharynx was clear. The JVP was greaterthan 15 cm , chest exam showed bilateral crackles at the baseswith bibasilar dullness well as well as right greater than leftbase. Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm with a S3 andno murmur. Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended with anonpulsatile liver. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edemabilaterally to the hips with bilateral changes of arterial andvenous insufficiency. Laboratory studies were significant for anINR of 1.6 , BUN of 110 , creatinine 3 , white blood cell count of11.7 and a hematocrit of 27.9.EKG on admission was a normal sinus rhythm with evidence of aprevious anterior MI with lateral repolarization , ST and T waveabnormalities , and possible LVH.Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions , left greater than rightwith increased vascular markings and fluid in the right fissure ,but no discrete infiltrates.IMPRESSION: This is a 70-year-old woman with ischemiccardiomyopathy with an EF of 35% , coronary artery disease statuspost MI , insulin-dependent diabetes , peripheral vascular disease ,chronic renal insufficiency who presented in volume overloadafter a recent admission with insufficient diuresis.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Cardiovascular. In terms of pump , the patient was clearly ingross volume overload from both the right sided and left-sidedfailure on presentation. Her blood pressure was stable and shehad no evidence of severely decreased cardiac output or/and organperfusion. She was started on the Lasix drip at 10 mg per hourand Zaroxolyn at 2.5 mg p.o. daily. Her Lopressor was held for adecompensated heart failure. She initially diuresed wellovernight; however , on the second day her diuresis tapered offand her Lasix drip was turned up to 20 mg per hour and theZaroxolyn was increased to b.i.d. She met her I&O goal ofgreater than 1 liter negative overnight the following night ,however , a day later , she again had poor diuresis and theZaroxolyn was changed to Diuril. At this time , a repeat chestx-ray showed a very little change in her bilateral pleuraleffusions , so her diuresis up to this point was felt to beinsufficient. After the transition from Zaroxolyn to Diuril ,which was given 250 mg IV b.i.d. , she was noted to have anincrease in creatinine from 2.9. gradually up to 3.2; however ,remained stable for the next few days and the patient was able tomaintain good diuresis on this regimen without bump in hercreatinine.On 4/25/2006 , she was noted to have greatly improved lowerextremity edema and that improved lung exam and she had met hergoal weight of less than 85 kilograms. Lasix drip wasdiscontinued in the afternoon on 4/25/2006 and she was restartedon her home p.o. torsemide regimen of 100 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 50mg p.o. q.p.m. for anticipated discharge home on 8/13/2006 .  TheDiuril was also discontinued. The patient was anticipated to bestable on b.i.d. torsemide and p.o. on metolazone at home. Hernew dry weight on this admission was established at 85 kilogramsand this should be at a goal for diuresis should she requireadmission in the future.She will follow up with her CSH cardiologist for furthermonitoring of her volume status after discharge. In terms ofrhythm , the patient had a new presentation of atrial fibrillationon the prior admission and was started on amiodarone and Coumadinat that time. She was in normal sinus rhythm on presentation atthis admission and remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout theadmission and was monitored on telemetry with no other events.She was continued on her home dose of amiodarone and continued onCoumadin; however despite the dose being decreased from her homedose of 1 mg q.p.m. to a 0.5 mg q.p.m. , her INR continued to riseand was eventually 3.5. Her Coumadin was discontinued. She wasrecommended to be discharged off Coumadin and follow up with herprimary care provider during the week following discharge torecheck her INR and restart her Coumadin when it falls below 2.5.In terms of ischemia , the patient had no acute evidence ofischemia on presentation. Denied any chest pain and had nochanges consistent with ischemia on her EKG. She was continuedon aspirin and Lipitor throughout the admission.2. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency atbaseline. Her creatinine did increase from a baseline of 2.9 to3.2. During this admission , however , remained stable after thatpoint. She continued on renally-dosed medications and actuallyrequired repletion of both potassium and magnesium despite herrenal insufficiency throughout the admission in the setting ofaggressive diuresis. Her electrolytes were stable prior todischarge home. She was followed by the LCH Renal Clinic withwhom she has had a previous conversations about the possibilityof hemodialysis in the future and she will see them shortly afterthis discharge:3. Pulmonary: The patient had dyspnea on exertion and bilateralpleural effusions on her chest x-ray on admission. This was allfelt to be consistent with her heart failure. She did have nosigns or symptoms of any infectious etiology either on imaging oras a part of her clinical picture. Her dyspnea on exertion andher lung exam both improved with her aggressive diuresis.4. Endocrine: The patient had erratic fingersticks early in theadmission with a very low fingerstick blood glucoses in themorning initially , so her p.m. Lantus dose was decreased from 18units to 16 units and the NovoLog sliding scale was started.On 11/10/2006 , she was noted to continue to have lower sugars inthe morning , but routinely elevated sugars in the afternoongreater than 200. She was started on q.a.c. NovoLog regimen.However , on this regimen , she was found 1 morning to have afingerstick blood glucose of 33 and to be hypothermic with atemperature of 94 taken rectally. This was thought to besecondary to hypoglycemia which may have progressed over severalhours prior to assessment and her temperature returned to normalat 98 after her blood glucose was aggressively repleted. It wasfelt that the patient likely had decreased metabolism of herinjected insulin in the setting of worsening renal failure , so ,her Lantus was decreased in accordance with a curbsideconsultation with the diabetes management service. She will bedischarged home on a similar regimen to her home regimen simplywith a decreased Lantus dose down to 12 units nightly. Sheshould continue to monitor her fingerstick blood glucoses athome. We were hesitant to change the types or timing of herinsulin during this hospitalization. I left that item to befurther managed by her primary care provider after discharge:5. Hematologic: The patient has a chronic normocytic anemiafelt likely to be secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency.Her iron studies were rechecked on this admission and her ironstudies were also normal. She was continued on Aranesp throughthis hospitalization and she is on Procrit as an outpatient andshe will continue on that with further discussion with the GGVHRenal Clinic after she is discharged.6. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was fluidrestricted to 2 liters of fluid per day p.o. and potassium andmagnesium were repleted as needed and she was maintained on acardiac diet. Prophylaxis was with Coumadin and Nexium.DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will be discharged to home with VNAservices for some home physical therapy. She will follow up withher primary care provider Dr. Bublitz at MHS and also with theSRRH Cardiology Clinic and Renal Clinic. She should have her INRchecked within 4-5 days after discharge and her Coumadinrestarted when her INR is less than 2.5.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.2. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.3. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily.4. Folate 1 mg p.o. daily.5. Lantus insulin 12 units subcutaneous nightly.6. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.7.

CHF.2. Stage IV esophageal cancer.PRESENTING SYMPTOMS:Mr. Kanaan is a 68-year-old gentleman with stage IV esophagealcancer who was two weeks status post his third cycle ofchemotherapy for his cancer. He also had ischemic cardiomyopathywith a known ejection of 20% and coronary artery disease statuspost CABG in 1993. He presented with progressive shortness ofbreath over the three days prior to admission. He denied anyfever. However , he did note increase in his weight and increasedlower extremity edema over the last week. He has three-pilloworthopnea at baseline , but has been sleeping both upright for thethree days prior to admission. Two weeks prior to admission , hewas walking in the mall and was able to accomplish all of hisADLs without difficulty. On admission , he was unable to walkmore than 20 feet without becoming severely dyspneic. He doesdescribe having diminished appetite , increased fatigue , and threedays of copious watery stool , possibly related to hischemotherapy.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Significant for pneumonia two weeks ago treated as an outpatient ,esophageal cancer stage IV status post chemo x3 cycles ,obstructive sleep apnea , ischemic cardiomyopathy , COPD , atrialfibrillation status post pacemaker and AICD placement , gout ,pulmonary vasculitis , and also CAD.OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:Include amiodarone , digoxin , colchicine , Atrovent , lisinopril ,spironolactone , torsemide , Ativan , Zocor , and Prilosec.ALLERGIES:He has no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY:He lives at home and denies alcohol use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:The patient was afebrile with the temperature of 95.8. His heartrate was in the 90s. His blood pressure was 90/60 breathing at arate of 22. His room air oxygenation was 82% , but increased to98% on 3 liters nasal cannula. He was slightly uncomfortablesitting straight up in bed and visibly tachypnic. His lung examdemonstrated bilateral scattered wheezes throughout the lungfields and bibasilar crackles. His JVP was approximately 15 cm.Heart exam reveled regular rate and rhythm with prominent S3.Abdominal exam was nontender. His extremities had 2+ pittingedema to the knees.PERTINENT LABS:On admission , he had a creatinine of 1.7 , which is at hisbaseline and BUN of 46. His BNP was 2960 , CK 48 , CK-MB 1.0 , andtroponin 0.1. Hematocrit 44.5 , white count 7.8 , and D-dimer was150. His INR was 1.3.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:The patient had a palliative esophageal stent placed on 4/5/05 .HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular: The patient presented with exam and labsfindings consistent with decompensated heart failure. For this ,he had a known ejection fraction of 20%. While he was in thehospital , he had strict I's and O's and was diuresed with Lasixand torsemide. His diureses was somewhat limited by systolicblood pressure with a range of 85 to 110 during hishospitalization. On discharge , his weight was down to 82.1 kgand was down from 87.5 on admission. The patient did have slightleak in his troponin of 0.1 on admission , but his EKG wasunchanged and his enzymes x3 were negative except for thetroponin , which did not trend to higher. His cardiac medicalregimen was maximized with an ACE inhibitor or statin and babyaspirin was started on him. He was discharged home on torsemide100 mg daily in addition to his spironolactone dose.2. Pulmonary: The patient received Atrovent nebulizers in-houseto help with his shortness of breath. His primary etiology ,however , was pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heartfailure. His diuresis goal of 1.5 liter a day was achieved withthe combination of dopamine , nesiritide , and Lasix drips. He wasmost responsive to combination of nesiritide and dopamine. Atthe time of discharge , the patient's room air saturations were94% with ambulatory saturations of 86%. He was thereforedischarged home with oxygen to use overnight and whensymptomatic.3. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with diarrheathat was felt to be related to his chemotherapy , which has beencompleted two weeks earlier. Stool was sent out for C.difficile , which was negative. His colchicine was initially heldbecause of his diarrhea , but the patient then developed a flareof his gout in his right great toe. Colchicine was resumed totreat this with good results. The patient received palliativestent to his esophagus on 4/5/05 that is placed by Dr. Capwithout complications. The patient had plans to follow up withis outpatient oncologist for ongoing care of his esophagealcancer after discharge.4. Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.7. His baselinechronic renal insufficiency was with the creatinine ofapproximately 1.3 to 1.5. At discharge , his creatinine was 1.6 ,which has been stable throughout his entire stay. He brieflyrequired having a Foley catheter placed on 4/4/05 because ofurinary retention , but it was removed the next day withoutdifficulty and did not have problems with voiding prior todischarge.5. Hematology: The patient was placed on DVT prophylaxis withLovenox. He did exhibit some right leg edema more pronouncedthan his left leg edema , but this is felt to be due to his goutin his right great toe.The patient was discharged to home with services and PT wasarranged to go and do a home safety evaluation.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:The patient's vital signs were stable. He was restingcomfortably in bed. Crackles in his lungs were notablydiminished from admission. He no longer was tachypnic. Hisheart had a regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , occasional S3. Nomurmurs.

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE2. IN-STENT RESTENOSISHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Segonia is a 53-year-old femalewith a cardiac history as follows. InOctober of 2001 she presented with substernal chest pain and had apositive exercise tolerance test. Cardiac catheterization atTormor Community Hospital revealed a 40% LAD , 50% left circumflex ,80% RCA , and 90% RCA. Stents were placed to both the proximal andmid RCA lesions. In August of 2001 , the patient represented withsubsternal chest pain and had a positive exercise tolerance test.Cardiac catheterization revealed in-stent restenosis. She wastreated with angioplasty and brachytherapy. In July of 2002 , sheunderwent repeat cardiac catheterization for recurrent angina andwas again found to have in-stent restenosis. Again , she underwenta angioplasty to zero percent. Later in July of 2002 , shepresented with chest pain; however , cardiac catheterizationrevealed no significant stenosis. Finally , in September of 2002 , thepatient presented with her usual chest pain and a cardiac troponinI of 0.15. MIBI showed inferior ischemia and cardiaccatheterization showed an RCA instent restenosis. She underwentPTCA without stenting.Today , the patient presents complaining that she has had a sharpchest pain across the precordium with onset three days prior toadmission and was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. Hersymptoms were intermittent until the day of presentation when sheexperienced 10/10 chest pain that was only partially relieved withsublingual nitroglycerin and was associated with shortness ofbreath. She presented to Vic Storgre Hospital Emergency Departmentwhere she was given aspirin 225 mg , nitroglycerin sublinguallyx one , and Plavix 75 mg x one.

He presents withshortness of breath. He lives in a nursing home and wasdiagnosed with pneumonia more than three weeks prior toadmission. The pneumonia , per report , was bilateral , leftgreater than right. He was started on a 10-day course oflevofloxacin , which he completed. He subsequently developed C.diff colitis and was treated with Flagyl. Three days prior tothe present admission , he noticing increased shortness of breath ,worsened with any movement in bed. A chest x-ray at the nursinghome reportedly showed an increased opacity in the right lowerbase , concerning for recurrent pneumonia. For this , he wasrestarted on levofloxacin. On the day of admission , his oxygensaturation dropped to 77% on room air , with improvement to themid 90's on 3 liters of oxygen. He noted a mild dry cough. Herdenied headache , dizziness , chest pain , hemoptysis , abdominaldiscomfort , or dysuria. His son reported that he has mildorthopnea at baseline , unchanged in recent days. Notably , he wasadmitted to the Sho Hospital in 5/23 for subacute shortness ofbreath , thought to be due to a CHF exacerbation , treated withLasix diuresis. An echocardiogram at that time showed anejection fraction of 55% , with mild left atrial enlargement , andmild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , along withinferobasal wall hypokinesis.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:As above in the history of present illness , along withconstipation , pain with movement of the right knee and right heelulcer , status post skin graft.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.

He smoked cigars for many years , currently anonsmoker. Her denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.FAMILY HISTORY:Notable for a father with diabetes and a brother with heartdisease.SUMMARY OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Shortness of breath: The patient initially presented withshortness of breath , saturating 77% on room air. He was noted onchest x-ray to have moderate bilateral effusions. The effusionswere likely secondary to congestive heart failure , althoughpneumonia with parapneumonic effusions could not be excluded.Given that he was afebrile with a decreasing white count and notincreasingly hypoxic , parapneumonic effusions were consideredless likely compared to worsening CHF. Given the concern forCHF , he was given Lasix 40 mg IV approximately one to two doses aday for large volume diuresis , with a goal of total body balanceof 2 liters negative per day. Over the course of hishospitalization , his bilateral effusions improved , although therewere small effusions noted on the chest x-ray at the time ofdischarge. His oxygen requirement decreased , and on the day ofdischarge , he was saturating 97-98% on 1 liter. Of note , thepatient was brought to ultrasound for a planned guidedthoracocentesis , but the effusion sites were small such that inthe context of this clinical improvement , thoracocentesis wasdeferred. He was maintained initially as well with vancomycinand levofloxacin , although the vancomycin was discontinued afterfour days , and the levofloxacin was discontinued on discharge ( ofnote , he received 10 days total of levofloxacin starting from3/27/2006 at his nursing home ). Echocardiogram noted anejection fraction of 55-60% with left ventricular hypertrophy ,consistent with diastolic dysfunction. The etiology of hiscongestive heart failure and pleural effusions was thereforethought to be atrial fibrillation with RVR. In terms of followup , he needs daily weights; if he gains greater than 2 poundsover 24 hours , it is recommended that his Lasix dose be doubledfor that day. As a discharge , he is being sent out on Lasix 40mg p.o. daily.2. Cardiovascular:a. Ischemia: The patient initially had a small troponin leak0.32 , which was thought secondary to demand ischemia from atrialfibrillation with RVR. For this , he was briefly started on aheparin drip. Subsequently , cardiac enzymes trended down. Thepatient was maintained on Coumadin and aspirin 81 mg , along withZocor and Questran for hyperlipidemia. On hospital day #3 to #4 ,telemetry noted pauses. EKG showed in addition to pausing , newT-wave inversions in anterior precordial leads , associated withST depression. This is thought to be either due to ischemia ordigitalis toxicity. His digoxin levels measured 1.3 to 1.4 , sodigoxin was held , with improving in pausing , but no change inT-wave inversions. In discussions with his outpatientcardiologist , it was thought that his T-wave inversions couldpossible be ischemic , although the appropriate course of actionwas not to pursue further anticoagulation or evaluation forcatheterization , given the patient's other medical issues. Hewas maintained on Coumadin , aspirin , Zocor , Questran , andLopressor.b. Rhythm: The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillationthroughout his hospitalization and was rate controlled withLopressor 37.5 mg t.i.d. ( increased from a home dose of 25 mgt.i.d. ). He was also maintained on Coumadin 2 mg daily foranticoagulation. On admission , there was a report that he hadruns of ventricular tachycardia and he was placed on a lidocainedrip for several hours in the emergency department. Nodocumentation regarding telemetry strips or QRS morphologiescould be obtained to verify this rhythm , however. In addition ,throughout his hospitalization , he had occasional runsnonsustained VT and SVT. As discussed above , he was thought tohave mild digoxin toxicity given pausing with a digoxin level of1.3 to 1.4. His digoxin was therefore held and subsequentimprovement in pausing was noted. Of note , on discharge , hisdigoxin has been discontinued. His primary care physician andcardiologist should consider whether or not to restart digoxin asan outpatient.c. Pump: The patient was aggressively diuresed with 40 mg IV ofLasix approximately one to two times per day , for a totaldiuresis of roughly negative 9 liters over the course of hishospitalization. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of55-60% with left ventricular hypertrophy , consistent withdiastolic dysfunction. As discussed above , he will be dischargedon Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily. Note , as mentioned above , if he gainsgreater than 2 pounds over a 24-hour period , his Lasix doseshould be doubled for that day.3. C. diff: The patient had a positive C. diff as an inpatient.He had been on Flagyl , which was started at the nursing home fora prior diagnosis of C. diff. Because of persistent bowelmovements , he was switched to p.o. vancomycin 250 mg q.i.d. , andupon discharge , he was started on a probiotic ( Saccharomycesboulardii 250 mg q.i.d. ) to replenish his gut flora. We willrecommend that he continue p.o. vancomycin and the probiotic for10 days after his diarrheal symptoms have resolved. If thesesymptoms do not improve on the regimen within the few daysfollowing discharge from Wood Rehab , we will recommend consideradding metronidazole IV and getting an infectious diseaseconsult.4. Diabetes: The patient had several bouts of hypoglycemiaduring the course of his hospitalization. These were appeared tobe related to poor p.o. intake. His Lantus was changed to 15daily , and he was covered with a NovoLog sliding scale. Afterthe changes , his fingersticks ranged in mid 100's.5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH was low with a normal freeT4 suggestive of sick euthyroid. He was continued on Synthroid25 mcg daily.6. Musculoskeletal: Given the patient's creatinine clearance ofless than 50 , his colchicine dose for gout was switched from 0.6mg b.i.d. to 0.6 mg daily. We continued his Neurontin forneuropathic pain , and Tylenol for right knee osteoarthritis. Hewas seen by Plastic Surgery registered nurse who recommendedPanafil with dressing for his right heel ulcer. He also has asmall ulcer developing on his left big toe , which will need closeobservation as follow up.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.8 h. p.r.n. for headache , aspirin 81 mgdaily , Questran 4 mg daily , colchicine 0.6 mg daily , Nexium 20 mgdaily , Lasix 40 mg daily , Neurontin 100 mg q.a.m. and 200 mgq.p.m. , Lantus 15 units subq at bedtime , Synthroid 25 mcg p.o.daily , Maalox one to two tablets p.o. q.6 h. , metoprolol 37.5 mgp.o. t.i.d. , Panafil ointment topical twice b.i.d. , Saccharomycesboulardii 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Zoloft 50 mg q.a.m. , Zocor 40 mg atbedtime , Flomax 0.4 mg daily , vancomycin 250 mg p.o. q.6 h. ,Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.p.m. , and iron sulfate 325 mg daily.eScription document: 2-8888178 EMSSten TelDictated By: FILIPOVIC , CHANCEAttending: BLILER , SANTIAGODictation ID 5669244D: 5/26/06T: 5/26/06

Please see a full dictated operative notes fordetails.HOSPITAL COURSE: She is a 76-year-old female with atrialfibrillation , dementia , and presenting with a left hip fracturefor orthopedic surgical correction on June , 2005. She hada surgery but without complication and a postoperative coursecomplicated by delirium , atrial fibrillation with RVR , and newhyponatremia.1. Ortho: She presented with left femur hairline fracture. Shehad a Girdlestone procedure performed and a left hemiarthroplastyperformed without complications. She was treated postoperativelywith cefazolin and has been discharged will be discharged onKeflex. She developed a mild incisional cellulitis with no signsof abscess and no fever.2. Cardiovascular:A. Ischemia: She was screened preop in the determinedintermediate risk. She was given a beta-blocker for surgery andhas no signs of symptoms of ischemia throughout thishospitalization.B. Pump: The patient was found to be mildly hypertensive andwas started on lisinopril with good control.C. Rhythm: The patient with known atrial fibrillation. Shedeveloped a rapid ventricular response on postoperative day #3.Heart rates in the 140s. Blood pressure was stable. This wasdifficulty to control with IV and p.o. beta-blocker , calciumchannel blockers , and digoxin so she was IV amiodarone loaded andis currently undergoing a p.o. amiodarone load as well. To dateon January , 2005 , she has had seven days of p.o. 400 mg t.i.d.and with current loading plan is seven more days of 400 mgamiodarone b.i.d. followed by 400 mg q.d. indefinitely. She iscurrently weight controlled. Heart rates in the mid to low 60s.She is getting amiodarone and Toprol-XL 300.3. Neurology: The patient has baseline dementia and per husbandwas developing delirium prior to transfer to Bingvent Medical Center .  Differential diagnosis of this delirium infectionversus medications versus electrolytes. This is also complicatedby stress of surgery. Psychiatry was consulted , and initiallyshe was restarted on her Cymbalta. However , this was stoppeddevelopment of hyponatremia. Postoperatively , the patient hasslowly improved in terms of mental status and this new baselineat discharge.4. Infectious Disease: The patient has been afebrilethroughout. There was a report of a Gram-negative UTI at theoutside hospital for which she received a course of Levaquin.She received postop prophylaxis of cefazolin until the September , 2005 , when this was stopped. Subsequently , she had increasedher white blood cell count to 23 , but no fever. UA , chest x-ray ,and stool for C. diff was sent and are all negative to date. Herwhite count has subsequently come down to 17 on the day ofdischarge , and she has remained afebrile. Keflex was restartedgiven the possible incisional site mild cellulitis , and she to becontinued until the staples were out after seven days course withimprovement. The patient developed a nonbloody diarrhea onMay , 2005. C. difficile studies were sent and have comeback negative to date. She was started on prophylactic dose ofFlagyl , which will be discontinued prior to discharge.5. Pulmonary: The patient developed pleural effusion postop butnever was compromised in terms of oxygenation or ventilation.She is making modest improvement at discharge and was selfdiuresing.6. Fluids , Electrolytes , and Nutrition: On admission , thepatient had a sodium of 140 which seems to gradually dropped toher course to a nadir of 119 on the November , 2005. No obviousmed changes except for the SSRI that was subsequently stopped.She was started on free-water restriction and urine lytes weredrawn. These lytes were consistent with picture of SIADH , sofree-water restriction has worked. On the day of discharge , hersodium is 131 , and she should be continued on free-waterrestriction and recheck in a week. Otherwise , electrolytes wererepleted p.r.n. The patient was given a low fat ADA diet.7. Endocrine. The patient's sugars are moderately wellcontrolled on regular insulin sliding scale. NPH insulin wasadded and has been titrated up to 12 units q.a.m. with regularinsulin sliding scale for coverage on top of that. The patientwith known hypothyroidism was euthyroid on admission. TSH waswithin normal limit. Her home dose Synthroid continued andshould be indefinitely.8. Hematology: Given the patient atrial fibrillation , she hadbeen on Coumadin at the outside hospital; however , onpresentation , her INR was subtherapeutic at 1.2. She was put onLovenox prophylactic dose prior to the surgery , and followingsurgery Coumadin was restarted and up titrated to 30 range. Ondischarge , she was therapeutic with an INR of 2.0 , Coumadin doseof 5 mg q.h.s. Her hematocrit has fell following the surgery ,and she has transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells onMay , 2005. Since then , her hematocrit has increasedappropriately and she has been stable throughout her rest ofadmission. On discharge , the hematocrit was 39.0.9. Prophylaxis: Given her high risk for DVTs , the patient wasprophylactic with Lovenox while waiting for her INR to becometherapeutic.

The patient was also admitted to DHC from5/15/06 to 07 for respiratory distress again with fluidoverload requiring diuresis. The patient was discharged to theEn General Hospital .  On the day of admission , the patientcomplained of burning chest pain and shortness of breathdifferent from her previous cardiac chest pain. The patient alsonotes that she did not feel well.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for chest pain , shortness of breath ,no palpitations , no neck , jaw or back pain , no nausea orvomiting , no dizziness , positive body swelling and positive20-pound weight gain over one month.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:1.

Abdomen , firm , distended ,nontender , no rebound or guarding. Lower extremities , edematous.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A1 49-year-old woman with a history of CHF ,COPD , CAD , status post CABG , status post PE with CHF exacerbationcomplicated by acute renal failure , hyperkalemia and UTI.PLAN:1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. Because of the patient's newonset of CHF , she was ruled out for MI shortly after admission.Serial enzymes and EKGs were negative for ischemia. Thepatient's chest pain , however was not consistent with thepatient's usual cardiac pain. During her stay , the patient wasmaintained on an aspirin , beta-blocker and a statin , although thechest pain was gone on arrival to the ED. Throughout the threemonths of the patient's stay , she did experience similar burning ,substernal chest pain. EKGs and enzymes sent during theseepisodes were always negative for ischemia. It was felt thatthis pain was likely secondary to GERD , as it often responded toMaalox , benzo , lidocaine and/or food.2. Pump: The patient's primary symptoms of shortness of breathlikely due to fluid overload. The patient was diuresed with IVLasix on the medicine floor. However , on 10/22/06 , the patientexperienced somnolence , low respiratory rate and desaturations inthe setting of opioid administration for pain. The patientresponded partially to Narcan and was transferred to the CCU forthree days for increased monitoring and continuation of diuresiswith a goal of negative 2 liters per day. The patient wastransitioned off methadone and on to oxycodone p.r.n. Thepatient was maintained on BiPAP and given albuterol and DuoNebinhalers. She passed through this acute decompensation with nofurther complications and was transferred back to E on7/7/06 .  On the floor , the patient was transitioned to p.o.Lasix. She was diuresed with a goal of 1 to 1.5 liters per day.IV Lasix were administered p.r.n. shortness of breath/physicalexam consistent with fluid overload. One week prior to transfer ,the patient was transitioned back to IV Lasix as her daily outputhad slowed on p.o. Lasix , she was unable to make TBB goals. Ontransfer , the patient shows signs of fluid overload , lowerextremity edema at bedtime BiPAP requirement , but relativelywhile pulmonary compensation. The patient's dry weight is about200 pounds.3. Rhythm: The patient has a history of afib. She was ratecontrolled with Lopressor and verapamil. She was alsoanticoagulated for both her afib and a recent PE with an INR goalof 2 to 3. Rate control was obtained with the beta-blocker andcalcium channel blocker. During the stay , the patient's heartrate is often slightly faster than goal ranging in the 90s to110s. Further rate control is limited by the patient's BP withsystolics often in the 90s to 100s. The patient was begun onverapamil , which was titrated up with her beta-blocker , which wastitrated down. On transfer , the patient was on verapamil 60 mgp.o. t.i.d. and atenolol 70 mg p.o. daily.4. Pulmonary: The patient's pulmonary issues as describedabove. The patient also has a history of PE and COPD/asthma.Post MICU , the patient was maintained on 4 to 5 liters oxygen bynasal cannula and during the day with BiPAP at nighttime. Thepatient's O2 requirement remained stable until transfer , althoughrequiring albuterol nebs p.r.n. The patient was kept on Coumadinfor PE with an INR goal of 2 to 3.5. Renal: The patient's baseline creatinine was 0.8. Onadmission , the patient had ARF felt to be due to CHF/volumeoverload leading to poor cardiac output , decreasing perfusion tothe kidneys. As the patient was diuresed , her renal functionimproved. This was stable throughout her stay until 10/24/06when her creatinine began to rise. It was felt that this was dueto a combination over diuresis leading to a prerenal state. Nomedication changes have been made near that time except for Lasixp.o. to IV. In the setting of creatinine bump , Lasix andspironolactone were discontinued on 10/12/06 .  On 10/25/06 , Lasix20 IV daily was restarted because of an improving creatinine , butagain held when creatinine returned as 1.5. On transfer , thepatient not on Lasix secondary to creatinine bumps/ARF. We didnot hydrate but monitor creatinine and continue diuresis whenable. Likely prerenal secondary to intravascular depletioncaused by liver cirrhosis leading to poor intravascularalbumin/osmotic pressure. In the setting of discontinuing ofLasix and poor renal function , the patient did becomehyperkalemic x2 during the week of transfer. The patient did notinitially respond to Kayexalate and lactulose , as she did nothave a bowel movement likely due to opioid use. The patient didrespond to insulins and D50. On 5/30/06 , the patient again hadthe elevated potassium to 5.5 , Kayexalate and lactulose x2 ,produced two bowel movements lowering her K appropriately.6. ID: During the stay , the patient was treated for UTI with athree-day course of levofloxacin. Upon discharge , the patientwas asymptomatic.7. GI: The patient was known to have vascular ectasias in herstomach. The patient is still guaiac positive during her staywith no active bleeding. Complicating this is the patient's needfor anticoagulation secondary to recent PE and afib. This isfelt to be the cause of her slowly dropping hematocrit for whichshe required occasional weekly transfusions of packed red bloodcells. The patient on a PPI b.i.d. The patient also hascirrhosis leading to poor synthetic function , poor intravascularosmotic pool contributing to fluid overload.8. Heme: As above , the patient required several transfusions ofTIBCs , although no more than once every one to two weeks. Feltdue to slow GI losses.9. Endocrine: During the patient's stay , she was on a basalLantus with Aspart coverage. This was titrated up to achievegood glycemic control. On discharge , the patient was on Lantus42 units subcu at bedtime and Aspart 10 units a.c./h.s. with anAspart sliding scale. This achieved fingerstick glucoses of 120sto 160s.10. Psych: The patient has a history of addiction and came toSMH on methadone. During the patient's stay , methadone wastapered and the patient transitioned to oxycodone. The patientoften complained of back pain and burning foot pain felt to beneuropathy , which was relieved by opioids. The patient oftenrefusing NSAIDs. On transfer , the patient was on oxycodone 5 to10 mg p.o. q. 6 h. p.r.n. pain , often taking 10 mg x4 a day. Thepatient also complaints of anxiety and insomnia for which 0.5 mgof Ativan achieved good resolution. At transfer , the patient wasnot on standing Ativan just requiring occasional one-time ordersat bedtime. Neurontin was also titrated up during the patient'sstay. Finally , the patient was started on nortriptyline atbedtime for pain with good effect.PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: The patient was alert and orientedx3 sitting up in a cardiac chair , able to walk to the bathroomunassisted. Off of O2 , although does experience mild shortnessof breath. Pupils equal , round and reactive to light andaccommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Cardiovascular ,irregularly irregular with no murmurs , gallops or rubs.Pulmonary , faint bibasilar crackles and no wheezes. Abdomen ,distended and nontender.

At the presenttime , a cardiac catheterization performed on April , 1999 showedleft main disease tapering at 40% , LAD disease at 40-45% in the midvessel , circumflex disease at 60% proximally and 70-80% in the midvessels and right coronary artery proximal to middle disease at40-60%. An Adenosine MIBI on May , 1999 showed evidence of anold infarct inferolaterally with severe ischemia elsewhere.Echocardiogram here at this institution showed an ejection fractionof 40% with global hypokinesis and severe lateral hypokinesis with2+ mitral regurgitation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , end stage renal disease since1995 , status post transplant in 1997 withrejection in 1999 , status post fistula in the right arm , insulindependent diabetes mellitus times 21 years with chronic renalinsufficiency and diabetic retinopathy , status post laparoscopiccholecystectomy , status post dilatation and curettage , coronaryartery disease as above.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Cozaar 50 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )Prilosec. 3 ) Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.day. 4 ) Insulin sliding scale. 5 ) Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , she is afebrilewith hemodynamics normal on room air. Sheis a well appearing , swollen , obese woman in no acute distress.She had normal dentition. She had no carotid bruits and no jugularvenous distension. Chest is clear bilaterally without rales.Heart is regular with a two out of six systolic ejection murmur andno gallops. Abdomen is obese , benign with a left lower quadrantincision , status post transplant nephrectomy. Peripheral vascularexamination demonstrates palpable radial and axillary pulses , 1+palpable femoral pulses and a barely palpable dorsalis pedis andposterior tibial pulses , both of which were monophasic dopplersignals.LABORATORY: Preoperative creatinine pre-hemodialysis was 6.7 andhematocrit was 34.1.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac SurgeryService from the Medicine Service on January ,1999 after she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times fourand mitral valve repair. The patient tolerated the procedure welland was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit forpostoperative care. She underwent dialysis on postoperative daynumber one and was extubated after dialysis with a clearing of heranesthetic medications and paralytic indications. She requiredsome inotropic support in the immediate postoperative period. Shewas gradually weaned from her pressure requirement afterextubation. Coumadin was begun given her history of mitral valverepair. Nutrition was consulted for lack of appetite. She didwell on her dialysis and was transferred to the floor onpostoperative day number four. Echocardiogram was obtained whichwas normal. The patient had an otherwise unremarkablepostoperative course which was somewhat slower than average basedon her severe medical problems and need for dialysis. Her chesttubes were discontinued on postoperative day number three as wellas her epicardial wires without problems. At the time of dischargedictation , she is ambulating independently , tolerating a renal dieton no supplemental oxygen.FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Dobis in sixweeks.

The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiplemedical problems including severe COPD , ( on home O2 2 litersbaseline sat below 90s ) , nonsmall cell lung cancer , diagnosed in1999 status post multiple chemotherapy regimens , most recentlyALIMTA from 9/27/2005 to 09 , diabetes , obesity , andchronic renal insufficiency , who was admitted to MICU on11/26/2005 for neutropenia , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain ,shortness of breath , requiring intubation , hypertension , prerenalazotemia with a creatinine of 2.9; all of which are believed tobe secondary to sepsis.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included Avapro , Lipitor , Decadron ,ranitidine , Humalog , allopurinol , Alimta , Flonase , vitamin D ,B12 , and Colace.ALLERGIES: Bactrim , resulting in acute renal failure andhyperkalemic , and penicillin resulting in anaphylaxis.SOCIAL HISTORY: Pertinent for the fact that she lives at home.She has a remote history of smoking , quit 15 years ago , anddenies alcohol.FAMILY HISTORY: Pertinent for hypertension , stroke , thyroidcancer , and cervical cancer.FINDINGS ON ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Shows a temperatureof 98.9. pulse of 116 , and blood pressure 84/47 , and 96% onventilation. General exam: She is an obese female , intubatedand awake , motioning to take her tube out. Skin exam showedscattered group petechial areas over the torso , abdomen , andunder the right breast. HEENT Exam shows pupils equal , round ,and reactive and anicteric , with a normal JVP. Pulmonary examshows decreased mildly decreased breath sounds at the right base.No crackles , increase in expiratory phase , few scattered rales.Cardiac exam shows tachycardia otherwise regular rhythm. A 2/6systolic murmur across precordium. Abdomen is soft , obese ,positive bowel sounds , nontender , and nondistended with chronicskin changes below the pannus. Extremities show trace to 1+edema to the shins , with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.Neurologic , the patient is awake; however , the exam is otherwisedifficult to perform secondary to the patient being intubated.PERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION: Show a white count of 0.74 with 46%polys and 6% bands , resulting in an absolute neutrophil count of340 , a hematocrit of 26.2 , and platelets of 37. Creatinine of3.1 , a PTT of 83.5 and INR of 1.4 , and lactic acid of 1.4.Chest x-ray on admission shows right infrahilar mass , bibasilaropacities , with chronic alveolar disease versus new fusions , Icannot rule out infiltrate. Abdominal CT shows small bowel wallthickening and left-sided atelectasis versus pneumonia.PROCEDURES: Status post intubation and extubation.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:1. Infectious disease: Ms. Dozois was admitted with fever andhypertension , and I was concerned for sepsis , I initially thoughtnosocomial pneumonia versus GI as the primary source. Sherequired intubation and pressors , and was started on vancomycin ,Levaquin , and aztreonam along with Flagyl empirically. Her urinegrew Enterococcus and she was changed to Levaquin only on6/21/2005 to treat an enterococcal UTI and possible nosocomialpneumonia. An abdominal CT was obtained , which shows small bowelwall thickening and injection of the SMA territory concerning fora neutropenic enteritis. Surgery was consulted and she wasmanaged conservatively with antibiotics initially and then withbowel rest. She is no longer neutropenic and was off Neupogenover a week prior to discharge. She was afebrile over the lastweek and will stay and finish the 14-day course of Levaquin forUTI.2. GI: Ms. Lorts was treated with bowel rest for her neutropenicenteritis and once she was no longer neutropenic withoutabdominal pain , she was started on clear liquid diet. However ,she developed intermittent GI bleed , secondary to likelysloughing of her mucosa status post neutropenic enteritis. GIwas consulted and she was again placed on bowel rest. Though ,she has a history of colonic polyps , GI also felt that theculprit of her GI bleed is mucosal sloughing as well. Shecontinued to have intermittent episodes of bloody diarrheawhenever she was re challenged with p.o. intake. Her C-diff isnegative. Colonoscopy was deferred secondary tothrombocytopenia. She required multiple red blood transfusionsto maintain her hematocrit greater than 26 , though she was neverhemodynamically unstable. Finally , after given sustained bowelrest , her blood stools resolved , and she was able to tolerateoral contrast and an abdominal CT on 9/6/2005 showed no smallbowel wall thickening or any other intraabdominal process causingher symptoms. Her diet was advanced , and she was toleratingregular diet at the time of discharge without problems.3. COPD: On home O2 , typically requiring 2 liters with baselinesat over 90s. Ms. Shubrick was intubated on admission for increasedshortness of breath and hypoxia. She was extubated the followingday on 8/22/2005 .  She requires BiPAP nightly , now stable on 2to 4 liters nasal cannula during the day.4. Heme: On chemotherapy induced anemia with hematocrit drop onadmission to 21 from the baseline of around 26. She respondedwell initially to three units of packed red blood cells over10/18/2005 and 09 .  However , in the setting of her GIbleed from a sloughing mucosa secondary to resolving neutropenicenteritis and recent chemo , she required multiple further RBCtransfusions to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. She wasalso thrombocytopenic , status post chemo and required multipleplatelet transfusions to keep her platelets greater than 30 , 000.Hematology was consulted secondary to suboptimal busted plateletlevels status post transfusions , which was felt to be secondaryto poor marrow response in the setting of recent chemo ( workupwas negative for other possible causes refractorythrombocytopenia , nystatin , allopurinol , were held given possibleworsening of her thrombocytopenia ). On discharge her hematocritand platelets were stable respectively at 29.8 and 46 , 000 and shehad not required a transfusion in greater than 24 hours prior todischarge.5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's baselinecreatine is 1.7; however , on admission it was noted to be 3 ,likely secondary to hypovolemia from vomiting and diarrhea ( FENawas 0.22% ). Her creatinine is now back to baseline withhydration. Her creatinine was 1.1 prior to discharge.6. Nonsmall cell lung cancer: The patient is on Alimta startedfor her neutropenia , which has since resolved. She will followwith her oncologist Dr. Ervin Tonrey for further therapy.7. Endocrine: Because of her insulin-dependent diabetes , thepatient was placed on portland protocol while on the stress dose.Steroids were discontinued on 6/21/2005 and she passed acortisol stimulation test on 6/21/2005 as well. She was changedto standing insulin on 6/21/2005 and her Lantus was up titratedalong with sliding scale insulin to maintain blood sugars in the80s to 120s. She will return home on her home regimen.8. FEN: TPN was started on 10/4/2005 , given her bowel rest forpossible neutropenic enteritis. She restarted p.o. intake on10/16/2005 and tolerated advancement to diabetic diet , and shewas weaned off her TPN prior to discharge.CONSULTANTS: General Surgery , Hematology , and Gastroenterology.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: Vital signs: T max 98 , bloodpressure 120/60 , pulse 88 , and respirations 20 sating at 95% on3.5 liters of oxygen. General exam shows an obese female restingand in no acute distress. Nasal cannula in place. HEENT Examwas normocephalic , atraumatic. Pulmonary exam showed decreasedair entry , decreased breath sounds , but otherwise no obviouswheezes or rhonchi. Cardiovascular exam shows regular rate andrhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops , but decreased heart sounds.Abdominal exam shows an obese abdomen , nontender , nondistended ,positive bowel sounds. Extremities show 1 to 2+ edemabilaterally to the knee. Skin exam shows a area where leftinternal jugular line was removed and the site is intact anddressed. Improved erythema in her intertriginous areas.Neurologic exam shows the patient is alert and oriented x3without any focal neurologic deficits.The patient was discharged in stable condition and she willfollow up with Dr. Marco Derosset in one week.The patient is full code.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 to 1000 mg p.o. q. 6h p.r.n.pain , headache , if fever is greater than 101 , Peridex mouth wash10 mL twice a day , nystatin mouth wash 10 mL swish and swallow 4x day as needed , oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q. 6h p.r.n. pain ,simethicone 80 mg p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n. gaseousness , trazodone 25 mgp.o. at bedtime , miconazole nitrate 2% powder topical b.i.d. toareas between skin folds including under the right breast , Nexium20 mg p.o. daily , Lantus 30 mg subcutaneous daily , DuoNeb 3/0.5mg Nebs q. 3 h. p.r.n. shortness of breath , aspart 4 units beforeeach meal subcutaneously , folate 3 mg p.o. daily , Avapro 150 mgp.o. daily , meclizine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Combivent 2 puffsinhaled q.i.d. , vitamin D 125 0.25 mcg p.o. daily.eScription document: 1-3330661 AFFocusDictated By: SPAHN , LELANDAttending: SCHEURING , WILLY LYMANDictation ID 8581453D: 7/16/05T: 2/16/05

Left atrialappendage resection and right atrial appendage resection.Bypass time: 219 minutes. Crossclamp time 156 minutes. Therewere no complications. The patient was transferred to the unitin stable fashion with lines and tubes intact. In the ICU ,starting postop day #1 , the patient was extubated , postop day #2remains AV paced. Transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperativeday #2.SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:Neurologic: Pain control , Toradol.Cardiovascular: On Coumadin , captopril issues was being AV pacedthrough a.m. with transfer and now in first-degree AV block ,holding Lopressor.Respiratory: No issues , have been extubated postoperative day#1.GI: Passed speech and swallow. Diet was advanced as tolerated ,Nexium for GI prophylaxis.Renal: Started Lasix 20 b.i.d.Endocrine: Diabetes insulin treatment with subq insulin.Hematology: Anticoagulation with Coumadin , recent MAZEprocedure/atrial fibrillation.ID: No issues.Transferred to the Stepdown Unit where heproceeded to progress well. Postop day #2 , chest tubes removedwires left in. Postop day #3 , slow junctional rhythm with ratesin the 40s being externally V paced , rate of 88 and wires notworking. EP states if further rhythm is not recover by postopday #4 to #5 to reconsult. Foley reinserted for retention of 400mL output. Started Flomax. On low-dose Coumadin for MVP/MAZE incase pacemaker was needed. We will need rehabilitation upondischarge. Post-day #4 remains to be V paced with junctionalrhythm. The wires are in and do not conduct or capture. EPfeels the patient may require pacemaker , we will observe for now.Upper extremity noninvasive studies for left greater than rightarm swelling , negative for DVT. Holding Coumadin pendingpossible pacemaker placement. Past video swallow today forregular diet.Postop echo pending for MVP. Rehabilitation when medicallyready. Postop day #5 , postop showed slow junctional rhythm withEP following for possible pacemaker , and they set a pacemaker atheart rate of 40. The patient in junctional rhythm/afib , heartrate in the 60s , A wire and do not conduct or capture. V wireset at a backup rate of 40. EP just came by and feels patient islikely recovered conduction. Possibly an atrial fibrillationversus accelerated junctional with heart rates in the 80s andthinks pacemaker will not be indicated. Plan to discontinuewires in a.m. if the patient's rhythm remain stable.Postop echo done for MVP. EF 55% , No comment on MR. Foleydiscontinued last night after insertion voiding well today onFlomax. Low-dose Lovenox anticipate eventual discharge torehabilitation on Lovenox/Coumadin and bridge after pacemaker.White count up slightly to 11.1 low-grade temps. UA negative.Rehabilitation when medically ready given possibility ofpacemaker requirement. Postop day #6 , spoke with EPS as thepatient is in stable sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block ,okay to remove wires implanted for pacemaker , ambulating well forroom air. We plan to send to rehab when bed available.

In 1/16 , the patient underwentstenting of that coarctation and since then he has been followedby serial echos. In the recent echo , he was noted to also haveprogression of his aortic valve stenosis. The patient nowpresents with marked limitation of his activities with somecomplaint of the anginal type symptoms that wakes him one to twotimes a week. The patient had a cardiac catheterization done on10/15/06 , which showed a 70% mid circumflex and 70% proximal OM2 ,and a 40% proximal LAD and patient is now referred for aorticvalve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting.The patient's past cardiovascular intervention , as stated above ,stenting of the coarctation on 1/16 and status post twocardiac catheterizations.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:The patient's past medical history is significant for thecoarctation , aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.

Hematology from the sameday: white count of 12.7 , hematocrit of 43.3 , hemoglobin of 14.2 , platelets at275 , 000 , PT of 13.2 , INR 1 , and a PTT of 29.9.Cardiac catheterization done on 10/15/06 , coronary artery stenosis with a70% mid circumflex , 70% proximal OM2 , and a 40% proximal LAD.EKG on 10/15/06 normal sinus rhythm at 74. Chest x-ray reportedas normal from 8/4/06 .HOSPITAL COURSE:The patient was admitted on 2/4/06 and was taken to operatingroom and underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 21 St. JudeRegent valve and an aortic root patch and a CABG x1 with thesaphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal #1. The patient'stotal cardiopulmonary bypass time was 156 minutes , cross clamptime was 220 minutes. The patient came off the heart lungmachine without any difficulty on no pressors and was taken up tothe Intensive Care Unit and extubated 14 hours postoperatively.The patient's postoperative course by systems:Neurologically:remained intact.Cardiovascular: The patient initially was not on any pressors but forpressure , required pacing and was startedon some dopamine as well as vasopressin , which was on untilpostoperative day #3. By postoperative day #4 , patient was started on low-dosebeta-blockers , however , had some bradycardia and no furtherbeta-blockers were given throughout his postoperative stay. Thepatient remained in normal sinus rhythm in the rates of 70s-80s on nomedication.Respiratory: The patient was extubated 14 hours postoperativelyand was on Lasix for diuresis. He will be sent home on five moredays of Lasix at 20 mg p.o. daily. His discharge chest x-rayshows minimal edema.

However , he had no prior historyof GERD or ulcer and will not be on any medications on discharge.Renal: The patient had a stable BUN and creatinine throughouthis postoperative course and will be discharged with just 5more days of Lasix 20 qd , with potassium replacement.Endocrine: The patient was on oral and insulin ,preoperatively and required an insulin drip intraoperatively andclosely followed by our Diabetes Service. The patient isrequiring a little bit more Lantus then he took preoperatively , as well assome insulin with meals. The patient should follow hisfingersticks as he was preoperatively and follow up with his PCPfor his diabetric management.Heme: The patient is on Coumadin for hismechanical aortic valve. However , his INR on day of discharge was stillnot therapeutic with an INR of 1.4. The decision was made for the patient to beable to be discharged to home with a Lovenox bridge. He will be senthome with 120 mg of Lovenox until his INR is greater than 2. Aphone call was placed through the Naplesgea Hospital .  They will followclosely due to the lovenox bridge then will also follow his coumadin dosing.The patient is also on baby aspirin for his coronary arterydisease. The patient had a stable hematocrit with a dischargehematocrit of 26 and INR stated above of 1.4.The patient is otherwise in stable condition. A decision was made that thepatient to be discharged to home on postoperative day #8.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:He will be discharged on these following medications:eScription document: 8-7967132 EMSSten TelDictated By: RIDDERHOFF , AMBROSEAttending: BUECHNER , WALLACE TITUSDictation ID 6694696D: 5/5/06T: 5/5/06

White blood cell count was 7.08 ,hematocrit 25.9; on June , 1999 , the patient's hematocrit was31.9 , and platelets 279. Echocardiogram from September of 1999 hadmoderate to severe left ventricular hypertrophy , ejection fractionof 55% , borderline hypokinetic inferior left ventricular wall , mildmitral regurgitation , and left atrial dilatation. Carotidnoninvasives from October of 1999 showed no significant right orleft internal carotid stenosis.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 50 year old woman with a history ofend stage renal disease , status post renaltransplant in February of 1997 , history of insulin dependent diabetesmellitus , coronary artery disease , status post coronary arterybypass grafting in 1996 ( left internal mammary artery to leftanterior descending and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal ) ,now with episodes of rapid heart rate and episodes of skipped beatsin association without shortness of breath. Also , the patient hashad a hematocrit drop from 31 to 26 on admission and a history ofblood in stool over the last month. The patient was guaiaced onadmission and during her stay and remained guaiac negativethroughout the whole time. The patient was placed on cardiacmonitoring and had no events recorded on the monitor. On September , 2000 , the patient's hematocrit dropped to 21. She wastransfused two units of blood and her hematocrit went up to 31. Anexercise tolerance test MIBI was performed which was negative forischemia. The patient's ejection fraction from the MIBI wasapproximated to be 69%. On August , 2000 , carotidnon-invasives were repeated which revealed moderate internalcarotid plaque on the right. Otherwise , she had mild stenosis ofthe other arteries. An echocardiogram was also performed whichrevealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejectionfraction of 65%. The patient was taken to Electrophysiology Studyon October , 2000 which revealed nonsustained ventriculartachycardia with possible right ventricular outflow tract origin.It was hoped that she could be maintained on Lopressor andVerapamil. Due to the results of this study , the patient wasalready on Atenolol for Beta blockade and Verapamil was tried.However , her blood pressure did not tolerate this medication. Theday after the electrophysiology procedure on March , 2000 , thepatient was orthostatic. She was given a 250 cc fluid bolus andencouraged to drink more p.o. fluids and she was discharged instable condition the next day. The patient remained symptom freeduring the entire hospital course. The patient's triglycerideswere checked during the hospitalization and found to be very highin the 1 , 500 range.

Patient denies any chest pain , nausea ,vomiting , palpitations or syncope. She does acknowledge sittingorthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for approximately 48hours before admission , no lower extremity edema. She denies anychanges in diet or changes in medical adherence. She states herweight has been about constant at 180 pounds on her home scale.She does note that she has poor exercise tolerance at baselinebut even now unable to perform activities of daily living for 48hours , so she came to the Istbern Sentne Emergency Department with herdaughter. She was found to be hypertensive , hypoxic withclinical and chest radiographic evidence of congestive heartfailure. She was treated with oxygen , IV Lasix and nitro-pacedin the ER and admitted for further treatment of her CHFexacerbation. Her physical exam revealed a heart rate of 52beats per minute , respiratory rate of 20 , blood pressure of176/74 , and she was satting 97% on 4 L of oxygen. The patientwas in no acute distress , she is pleasant , a little overweight ,alert and oriented times person , place and time. Her jugularvenous pressure was approximately 12 cm of water. She did havepulses parvus et tardus , no Kussmaul sign. She had ralesone-half way up the pulmonary fields bilaterally. Her heart wasregular rate and rhythm , bradycardic. There was a 3/6 systolicmurmur with a slurred S2. Her abdomen was benign. She had nolower extremity edema. She had cool extremities and neurologicexam , other than patient being alert and oriented , was nonfocalwith no motor deficits.LABS ON ADMISSION: Revealed a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.2 ,chloride 105 , bicarb 26 , BUN 31 , a creatinine 1.9 , a glucose of152. A white count within normal limits , a hematocrit of 41.8 , aplatelet count of 289 , calcium 8.8. Her coags revealed a PTT of32.7 , an INR of 3.2 , her creatine kinase was 41 , her MB fractionwas 1.9 , her troponin was negative. Her BNP , brain natriureticpeptide , was 885. Her chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonaryedema. Her EKG showed sinus bradycardia at48 beats/minute. No significant ST or T-wave abnormalities. Nosignificant from change from 1/8 .PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Patient has known aortic stenosis with anAVA of 1.0. She has coronary artery disease status post acute MIin 2001 , status post two-vessel CABG , she had the left internalmammary to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the OM-2. Shehas atrial fibrillation , for that she is on amiodarone andCoumadin. She has diabetes mellitus. She hashypercholesterolemia , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease ,bladder cancer status post resection.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:1. Amiodarone 300 mg each day.2. Aspirin 81 mg each day.3. Lasix 120 mg by mouth twice a day.4. Zestril 40 mg po each day.5. Zocor 40 mg p.o. every night before bedtime.6. Niferex 150 mg twice a day.7. Insulin NPH 48 units in the morning and 4 units in theevening.8. Levoxyl 25 mcg each day.9. Coumadin 2.5 mg on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , and 3 mg onTuesday , Thursday , Saturday , Sunday.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.SOCIAL HISTORY: She denied all vises , such as tobacco , alcohol ordrugs. She lives with her daughter , Severi .REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As in HPI , no fever , chills , rash , medicationschanges or urinary symptoms.ASSESSMENT ON ADMISSION: She was an 80-year-old woman with knowncoronary artery disease here with a chief complaint of worseningshortness of breath consistent with congestive heart failureexacerbation most likely left-sided diastolic dysfunction. Therewas no clear etiology , however , dietary or medication issues werenot likely given the patient's excellent awareness andinvolvement in her care. The suspicion was that the patient mayhave had increasing blood hypertension out of control , increasingoxygen demand and creating diastolic function and pulmonaryedema. The role of her aortic valve was unclear , however , theremay have been gradual progression and renal artery stenosiscannot be rule out as an etiology.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular: In terms of her cardiovascular system , shewas diuresed with IV Lasix and her electrolytes were followedclosely. She came in with a weight of 84.7 kg and left with aweight of 83.7 kg. For two days in the middle she was diuresedwith IV Lasix120 mg b.i.d. and she was converted to oral Lasix and actuallycontinued her diuresis , in fact after pacemaker placement , whichwill be noted below , she may have actually continued to urinateeven more so on the last day of her admission. Her bloodpressure was stable throughout her stay , in the low 100s ,consistently below 150 systolic and above 100 systolic.Rhythm: In terms of her rhythm , she was found at several pointsthroughout her stay in the first several days to have bradycardiaconsistent with junctional rhythm and because of her atrialfibrillation treated with amiodarone; it was thought she wouldbenefit from a pacemaker also because of her beta-blocker. So , apacemaker was placed on 6/21/2003 without complications. Thepacemaker was a dual-chamber PPM. Her INR before it was placedwas 1.7 , and there was some oozing from the site , however , herhematocrit was stable and her hemodynamics were stable for 24hours after the procedure. Electrophysiologists analyzed thedevice and found that it was working properly. She is scheduledfor follow up with Dr. Gutirrez on 4/13/2003 at 9:40 in themorning. She has been advised to limit her driving until thatappointment. She has also been advised that she will not be ableto have an MRI in the future. She will be discharged on Keflex( cephalexin ) 250 mg p.o. 4 times a day for 3 days on dischargefor her pacemaker and if she has any problems at all with herpacemaker she should call Dr. Richel attelephone # ( 851 ) 491-7503 , adetc # 33243.2. Pulmonary: The patient had PFTs done in 9/18 which showedan FVC of 73% of predicted , FEV1 of 77% of predicted , and FEV1 toFVC ratio of 108% , and FEF 25/75 of 80% , a TLC of 50% ofpredicted , an SVC of 73% of predicted , a residual volume of 40%of predicted , and an RV/TLC of 72% of predicted. Her DLCOuncorrected was 44%; her DLCO corrected was 44%. During herstay , patient had low O2 saturations at rest ranging from thehigh 80s to the low 90s , but often below 88% and on exertionconsistently in the mid-80% range , not depending on where theprobe was placed. She was unable to be weaned from the oxygenand will be sent home on oxygen. She should be followed up witha CT of the chest. A CT of the chest was done on this admission ,however , it was consistent with CHF and other things could not beruled out. Of note , on the chest CT there were found to be liverlesions which will be commented on below. The patient shouldalso be worked up for her pulmonary issues.3. Radiology: The patient had this chest CT which showedmultifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lungs , diffusehaziness , some septal thickening with slight basil predominance ,multiple borderline mediastinal nodes in the anteriormediastinum , an AP window region with the largest node on image21 measuring 1.3 x 2 cm , there were extensive vascularcalcifications , cardiomegaly with multi-chamber enlargement andparticularly dense coronary calcifications , trace right and leftpleural effusions. Visualized organs of the upper abdomendemonstrate multiple ill-defined low attenuation foci in theliver but no other abnormality. Review of bone window showsextensive thoracic degenerative change , sternal wires andepicardial pacer leads. The lung findings were consistent withcardiomegaly and CHF , but could not rule out other diagnosticpossibilities including atypical pneumonia , hypersensitivity ,pulmonary hemorrhage or less likely lymphangitic tumor. In orderto workup the liver mass , an ultrasound of the abdomen wasattained. The liver showed a mass 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm , it washyperechoic in the posterior segment of the right lobe of theliver corresponding to the dominant mass seen in the CT of7/21/203 and 11 , gallbladder was normal with no stones ,the biliary tree was normal , as were the right kidney and leftkidney , pancreas , although it was poorly visualized. The spleenwas normal , the aorta was normal , pleural effusion was noted onthe left which was small and prominent hepatic veins were noted.The radiologist's impression was that the ectogenic mass on theright lower lobe of the kidney corresponded in the location ofthe mass reported on prior CTs , may be a hemangioma or otherectogenic masses which could not be excluded and he noted thatthe patient could not hold her breath sufficiently well toevaluate the mass with Doppler. If indicated , the PMD shouldeither get a nuclear scan , CT , the radiologist suggested MRI butthat is now impossible given the pacemaker , for confirmation andfurther evaluation. Also , it was noted that she had prominenthepatic veins possibly due to the right heart failure.OTHER ISSUES:4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on her Levoxyl 25 andher home dose of insulin with good blood sugar controls generallybelow fingerstick of 200.5. Heme: The patient was continued on her Niferex. Herhematocrit was stable throughout her stay with her admissionhematocrit being 41.8 and discharge hematocrit being 38.8. Herwhite count also was not elevated. She is discharged with awhite count of 6.8. Her INR on admission was 3.2 , her Coumadinwas held and 1 mg of vitamin K was given before her procedure.Her INR on the day of the procedure , 6/21/2003 , was 1.7 and ondischarge it was 1.3. She will be reinstituted on her sameCoumadin level , to follow up with Dr. Garder and to have herCoumadin level checked on 5/25/2003 and be followed as she was.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: As admission medicines except #1 , she willbe taking cephalexin for 3 days and that is the only difference.Her primary care doctor can consider can titrating her CHFmedicines and/or her hypertension medicines.eScription document: 9-7893755 LMSCC: Stanley MalekBHDictated By: MACENTEE , ERNIEAttending: LOWN , LINDSEYDictation ID 6788148D: 8/23/03T: 8/23/03

The patient had his first MI in 1990 complicatedby congestive heart failure. An echocardiogram at an outsidehospital revealed EF of 22% with a dyskinetic apex and a dilatedleft atrium. In August of 1995 , he had another MI , washospitalized at Sterrice where he requiredintubation secondary to pulmonary edema. In April of 1995 , hewas admitted again for congestive heart failure and anechocardiogram demonstrated an EF of 25 to 30% , anterior andanterolateral hypokinesis , moderate inferior and mild septalhypokinesis and mild MR. Cath. in 1995 showed three vessel diseaseand the patient underwent four vessel CABG in October of 1996 withsaphenous vein graft to the PDA , OM1 and OM3 and a LIMA to the LAD.During the surgery , the patient had an ICG placed prophylacticallyas part of the CABG patch study. Since the surgery , he has hadadditional episodes of congestive heart failure with report of ahospitalization in September 2000 in Ox News The patientreports he was hospitalized at that time for difficulty breathingand a third MI. He required intubation during this hospitalizationand the course apparently was complicated by renal failure. SinceSeptember 2000 , the patient has reportedly felt well with no difficultybreathing or chest pain. More recently , two months prior toadmission , the patient was found to have atrial flutter. He wasstarted on 80 mg of sotalol and his arrhythmia spontaneouslyconverted. Today , the patient presented to hiselectrophysiologist , Dr. Handelsman for routine interrogation of hispacemaker and was found to have atrial fibrillation with a rapidventricular rate in the 120s. Additionally , the patient reportsworsening lower extremity edema bilaterally for the past six daysand decreased urine output. The patient denies chest pain ,shortness of breath. He has had no palpitations , diaphoresis ,nausea , vomiting. He denies dietary indiscretion or any medicationchanges. He has had no fever , dysuria or cough. He has stable twopillow orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion but no paroxysmal atrialfibrillation. His most recent echocardiogram was in September of2000 which showed a dilated left ventricle with EF of 15 to 20% andglobal hypokinesis. The right ventricle was moderately enlargedwith depressed function. He had a thickened aortic valve and noaortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. He had mild MR with anenlarged left atrium at 5.7 cm.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As stated , hypertension , diabetes ,hyperlipidemia , coronary disease andcongestive heart failure.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 10mg p.o. t.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg q. day ,Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d. , Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q. day , Lasix 80 mgp.o. b.i.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. h.s. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.day , and Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q day.Of note , upon further questioning , it turns out the patient hadbeen taking amiodarone and had only been started on sotalol brieflybut became hypotensive with that and so he was switched toamiodarone.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 20 pack year history of smoking andcurrently continues with binge drinking of greaterthan four whiskey drinks at a time.

While transferring the patient to the Operating Roomtable , he had a cardiac arrest lasting one and a half minutes. Hewas rapidly intubated and stabilized. Following the operation a anEKG was needed emergently. The patient ruled out for an MI. Hedid have postoperative atrial fibrillation. He is currently innormal sinus rhythm , but slips in and out of atrial fibrillation.His rate is well controlled on Lopressor 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q. day. He has been anticoagulated withCoumadin , and he is currently therapeutic with his most recent INRon 10/14/03 of 2.6. His most recent Coumadin doses have been five mgon 9/26/30 , three mg on 10/10 , zero mg on 9/19/2 ,and four mg on 10/27 .  The patient's primary cardiologist is Dr.Brant , and the patient will follow-up with Dr. Vandebrink .His most recent INR is 2.4 on 6/17/03 , and his Coumadin will bedosed at rehabilitation today.Respiratory: The patient was intubated for his procedures. He wasextubated without difficulty. He currently has no respiratoryissues. His oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. His most recentchest x-ray was a portable chest x-ray on 5/25/03 , which showedsubsegmental atelectasis and a minimal right pleural effusion , butno evidence of congestive heart failure or other disease processes.Gastrointestinal: A preoperative work-up before his coronaryartery bypass graft surgery showed that the patient was guaiacpositive and EGD on 12/10/03 by Dr. Zadorozny showed no lesions as alikely cause of his GI bleeding , but did reveal some gastritis. Itwas decided that it would be safe to proceed with surgery , and havethe patient follow-up with a colonoscopy after his procedure.Discharge was planned , and before discharge a colonoscopy wasperformed on 11/10/03 by Dr. Bealer . A single large pedunculatedsmooth polyp at 25 centimeters from the anus was found. After thisprocedure the patient did well initially , but then did developabdominal distention. At first it was thought that his symptomswere due to Ogilivie's syndrome or pseudo-obstruction , however ,because of his distention it was not felt safe to perform a bariumenema. A KUB showed air throughout the colon and small bowel. Hehad absolutely no pain or tenderness. The General Surgery Servicewas consulted and an NG tube was placed , and he was given enemasp.r. He did well with no complaints of pain or tenderness ,however , a KUB on 9/8/03 showed that his cecum was distended 12centimeters and the white count was over 20. CT scan showed acecum to be 14 centimeters and there was a suggestion of narrowingof the sigmoid colon. It was decided to take him to the OperatingRoom. A routine chest x-ray showed free air in the diaphragm whichwas concerning and surgery was undertaken. Please see theoperative note of Dr. Jou for details regarding this procedure.A right colectomy , sigmoid colectomy , cholecystectomy ,transverse mucous fistula , and sigmoid mucous fistula wereperformed. The patient improved well postoperatively. We wereable to advance his diet and discontinue his two JP drains. Atdischarge the patient was tolerating a regular diet. His wound ishealing well and his staples have been removed. Intraoperativelythe patient was found to have obstruction of the sigmoid colon anda pathological specimen revealed adenocarcinoma moderatelydifferentiated , four centimeters in maximum dimension. The tumorinvaded through the rest of the pericolonic fat. Margins wereclear and ten lymph nodes were negative for disease. The stage ofthe tumor is T4BN0MX. The patient will follow-up with Dr. Walkenregarding further management of this cancer.GU: Two attempts have been made to discontinue the patient's Foleycatheter most recently on 10/14/03 .  He had a high postvoid residual ,the Foley catheter was left in. The patient is on Flomax. He willbe discharged with a Foley in place and discontinuation of theFoley should be tried again in seven days. His most recent set ofelectrolytes on 6/17/03 include a potassium of 4.3 , magnesium 1.8.He is making good urine output.Hematology: The patient has had no hematologic issues during hishospitalization. His anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation iscovered above. His most recent laboratory values on 6/17/03 , arewhite blood cells 6.8 , hematocrit 30.4 , platelets 247 , PT 25.7 , PTT49.8 , INR of 2.4.Infectious disease: The patient was treated with perioperativeampicillin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl. He is currently on noantibiotics and has no infectious disease issues. His white countis 6.8 and he is afebrile.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.FOLLOW-UP: Dr. Pruna call for appointment in one to two weeks.Dr. Alfaro call for an appointment in one to twoweeks.

She does not have a historyof smoking or drinking. Her husband died a year ago ofcomplications from cardiac bypass.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 102.1 , bloodpressure 148/68 , pulse 84 , respirations 22 ,sating 92% on two liters. General examination: This is an obesewoman lying at a 30 degree angle on the bed , pleasant and not inacute distress. Head and neck examination was benign. Lungs haverales up one-third of the lungs bilaterally , no wheezes or rhonchi.Heart regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 with S3 and II/VI systolicmurmur , best heard over the base. Jugular venous pulsation at 11cm. Abdominal examination was soft , nontender , mildly distended ,no mass and normal bowel sounds. Extremities showed diffuseerythema from right heel extending to 5 cm below the knee , mildtenderness , edema greater in the right leg than the left leg. 3+pitting edema bilaterally. She also has a 5 cm x 5 cm skin graftover the right heel with some skin breakdown around the graft site ,slightly weepy , no pus. Neurologic examination: The patient isalert and oriented times three. Cranial nerves are intact. Thepatient does not have any sensation in bilateral legs. Normalstrength.LABORATORY DATA: Significant for hematocrit of 30.7 , white bloodcount 10 , 340 , with a differential of 76 polys , 14bands , 5 lymphocytes. Chem-7 was significant for creatinine of1.8. Her liver function tests were within normal range. Her CKfirst set was 120 with an MB of 2.6 and troponin of 1.39 , coagsnormal D-dimer of greater than 1 , 010. Her urinalysis was negative.Electrocardiogram showed 1 mm ST depression in the lateral leads ,unchanged from baseline. Chest x-ray revealed bilateralinterstitial prominence , could be consistent with pulmonary edema ,no focal opacities.HOSPITAL COURSE:PROBLEM #1 , CELLULITIS: On admission , the patient was started oncefazolin and Flagyl for broad coverage of cellulitis given she hasa history of diabetes mellitus. In addition , levofloxacin wasalso started on hospital day #2 to cover gram negative organisms.Blood cultures on admission are negative. Because of the skingraft on the patient's right heel , plastic surgery was consulted toassess the integrity of the skin graft. They concluded that theskin graft is intact and the source of the cellulitis was not inthe heel. On hospital day #3 , Flagyl was discontinued because thepatient could not tolerate oral sores and the GI upset. Therefore ,we elected to change the antibiotic regimen to Clindamycin andlevofloxacin. cefazolin and Flagyl were discontinued. On hospitalday #6 the patient developed diarrhea. Given her history of C.difficile in the past and the lack of improvement in hercellulitis , Infectious Disease were consulted. We startedcefotaxime and Vancomycin on hospital day #7. The patientcontinued to have low grade temperature spikes with daily bloodcultures which have all been negative. Wound culture of the bullaeon the right lower extremity was also taken which has also beennegative. Vancomycin was discontinued due to low suspicions ofresistant organisms. The patient also had LENIs which werenegative for DVT as well as a right foot film which showed no signsof osteomyelitis. Unfortunately , the cellulitis does not looksignificantly improved. We postulate that this is due to acombination of noncompliance with strict elevation , peripheraledema from congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular diseaseand diabetes. The patient continued to spike low gradetemperatures. We carried out pan culture which have all beennegative so far including urine , blood. At the time of thisdictation the patient has been on cefotaxime for seven days.Infectious Disease recommends an MRI to rule out osteo and deeperinfection since the cellulitis is very slowly improving.PROBLEM #2 , CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE AND CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:On admission we started to diurese the patient as she was volumeoverloaded by examination. In addition , we started her on heroutpatient blood pressure medications to control her hypertension.However , on hospital day #2 , the patient's blood pressure dippedinto the high 90s to 100 with a rise in creatinine. We withheldall blood pressure medication as well as diuresis. Her creatininecontinued to climb from 2.2 to 3.3. The urinalysis showed numerousred blood cells and no eosinophils. Of note , her urine culturegrew out lactobacillus which was not treated. Renal was consulted ,and it was thought that the patient's acute renal failure was dueto prerenal causes from a drop in blood pressure as well as mildATN. The patient's creatinine responded to gentle fluid bolusesand resolved on its own by hospital day #7. During the period ofacute renal failure , the patient also had marked hyponatremia whichalso resolved as the renal function improved. The patient'screatinine improved to 1.1 on hospital day #10. At this time , sheunderwent a CT with contrast to delineate a possible liver mass.Her subsequent creatinine climbed to 1.8. We had also started heron her outpatient dose of enalapril and Lasix. We elected todiscontinue the enalapril and Lasix due to her increasedcreatinine. We will observe and add back an ace inhibitor astolerated.PROBLEM #3 , CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST NON Q-WAVEMYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: The patient was admitted on a rule outprotocol. On her third set of enzymes she showed a CK of 142 , CK MBof 2.2 but a troponin of 6.64. The patient was asymptomatic withno chest pains and no electrocardiogram changes. Cardiology wasconsulted and it was felt that the patient had a small non Q-wavemyocardial infarction with a troponin leak. A repeat echo on thisadmission showed preserved EF at 55% with no observable wall motionabnormalities. As the patient has refused catheterization in thepast , it was decided that she be managed medically. She wasstarted on Metoprolol 12.5 mg b.i.d. as well as aspirin. Thepatient has remained symptom free.PROBLEM #4 , HYPERTENSION: The patient was initially slightlyhypotensive at a systolic blood pressure of 90s to 100 on hospitalday #1. Her enalapril and outpatient dose of Atenolol were held.She was started back on Metoprolol after the non Q-wave myocardialinfarction. Currently , her blood pressure is maintained between130-150 systolic. We attempted to add back enalapril at this timeto preserve her kidney function given her diabetes. However , hercreatinine increased mildly , thus we have elected to hold enalaprilagain.PROBLEM #5 , GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient has a history of chronicconstipation on home regimen of Dulcolax , senna , Colace andlactulose. A KUB was obtained on admission which showed air in thecolon but no obstruction. It was thought that her chronicdistention is from diabetic gastroparesis and relative immobility.The patient developed diarrhea during her hospital course for whichher laxatives were held. Her stool has been C. difficile negative.She has tolerated very little food due to abdominal distention.She has continued to advance her diet currently to some smallsnacks during the day. Her laxatives were re-instituted. Becausethe patient continued to spike a low grade temperature and she hadsome abnormal liver function tests , we pursued a renal ultrasoundto rule out her renal abscess which was negative , as well as aright upper quadrant ultrasound. The right upper quadrantultrasound showed a possible liver mass for which we ordered afollowup CT of the abdomen. The CT of the abdomen showed normalvariant of the shape of the liver , caused by a bowel loop that wasanterior to the liver. This is unchanged compared to a study thatshe had in 1996.PROBLEM #6 , ANEMIA: On admission the patient was slightly anemicwith a hematocrit of 30. During her past hospitalizations , thepatient always had a hematocrit around 30. On this admission herstools were trace guaiac positive. She received two units of packedred blood cell transfusion with an appropriate response to ahematocrit of 36. GI was consulted. However , since the patient wasstable with no further decrease in the hematocrit , it was decidedthat the patient would pursue an outpatient workup of her anemia interms of colonoscopy.PROBLEM #7 , VASCULAR: The patient has a history of peripheralvascular disease on admission. The Vascular Surgery service wasconsulted to help manage refractory cellulitis. ABIs were obtainedof the right leg which showed 0.5 to 0.6 on the right lowerextremity and normal on the left lower extremity which has beenpreviously bypassed. Pulse volume recording revealed mildlydecreased signal in both the right and left leg. The conclusionwas that the patient had right femoral popliteal disease withnormal resting pressures on the left. However , as the patient isnot very mobile , she does not complain of any claudicationsymptoms. It was decided that no surgery is indicated for her atthis time. We used heparin subcutaneous injections as her DVTprophylaxis during her hospitalization.PROBLEM #8 , CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient has congestiveheart failure from diastolic dysfunction. On examination , she has1+ edema throughout her body including her upper limbs in the chestarea. However , attempts at diuresis were aborted due to acuterenal failure. She continued to diurese on her own without anypharmacologic interventions , as her creatinine improved. At thistime her Lasix is held because of a small bump in creatinine fromlikely the contrast in CT as well as in the enalapril. Overall , sheis total body volume up , however , much improved from admission.PROBLEM #9 , TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS: The patient's blood sugarswere poorly controlled during the hospitalization with fingersticks in the high 100s to low 200s. This is partially due to thepatient's reluctance to take her full dose of NPH Insulin becauseshe is inconsistent with eating. She also has a sliding scale tocover her. We will encourage her to continue with her full dose ofInsulin as she tolerates food better.PROBLEM #10 , PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY AND LOW BACK PAIN: Thepatient's Neurontin dose was reduced to 100 mg t.i.d. from heroutpatient dose of 300 mg t.i.d. due to renal insufficiency. Shealso received Diazepam currently at 2.5 mg b.i.d. , reduced from heroutpatient dose of 5.5 mg b.i.d. because of renal insufficiency.She also requires morphine sulfate on a p.r.n. basis. Her paincontrol is satisfactory at the time of this dictation.Dictated By: WILBER BUCKBEE , M.D. YN2Attending: HARRIS BERDECIA , M.D. TC97  TR830/8430Batch: 4532 Index No. ZPGT3LEPH7 D: 3/9T: 3/9

The patient's postoperative course wassignificant for contrast induced oliguric acute renal failure. Arenal consult was obtained on 2/6/06 and the patient was seenby Dr. Studdard to evaluate her acute on chronic renal failure.Dr. Cowlin that her acute renal failure may be due to chronickidney disease from renovascular disease or possibly due tointerstitial nephritis in the setting of a drug allergy. Thepatient was also seen by Dr. Shope , Erik Garret Manuel F.from the Nephrology Department while she was an inpatient. Afterconsideration of possibilities causing her acute renal failure ,it was thought that her acute renal failure was most likely dueto cholesterol emboli syndrome given her eosinophilia , stepwiseprogression of renal impairment and her chronic course. Thepatient will need to be followed by a nephrologist as anoutpatient. In addition ,the patient has known renal artery stenosis that may havecontributed to her acute renal failure and she did have apossible drug allergy to diuril and perhaps a component of herrenal failure was also due to acute interstitial nephritis. On1/27/06 , the patient developed gross hematuria. At this time ,the urinalysis showed red blood cells but no evidence forATN. This gross hematuria was in the setting of aworsened coagulopathy. She had a renal ultrasound at that timethat was negative for renal obstruction. Gradually withresolution of her coagulopathy , the patient's urine outputincreased and her creatinine improved with supportive measuresalone. The patient did have gradual improvement in her urineoutput and her creatinine decreased to 2.8 prior to discharge.The patient is currently off diuretics at this time. Dailyweights should be checked and if her weight increases by morethan 3 pounds Dr. Bockoven should be notified. The patient was alsostarted on calcitriol given elevation of parathyroid hormone.Cardiovascular: Rate and rhythm: The patient has a history ofatrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Thepatient was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.6 h. for ratecontrol , however , this dose was decreased to 12.5 mg p.o. twice aday , given some bradycardia on her telemetry. The patient wasalso started on Flecainide 75 mg p.o. q.12 h. She will continueon these two medications upon discharge.Congestive heart failure: The patient had evidence forcongestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension during thishospitalization. The patient did become volume overloaded onphysical examination with an oxygen requirement , elevation of herJVP and shortness of breath. She was diuresed with Lasix duringher postoperative course. The patient was transferred to themedical Service on 2/10/06 for management of her renal failureand volume overload. The patient did undergo a trial of renallydosed dopamine to see if this medication improved her cardiacoutput and renal function. The patient showed no improvement onthis medication and it was discontinued after a short trial. Thepatient's diuresis was discontinued prior to discharge as thepatient did have acute worsening of her renal function , which mayhave been related to over aggressive diuresis. The patient wasinstead started on spironolactone for management of hercongestive heart failure. As stated above , she should have dailyweights checked.Ischemia: The patient has no history of coronary artery disease.She was maintained on aspirin , statin and a beta-blocker duringthe admission.Hematology: The patient was started on iron supplementation forher anemia in the setting of chronic kidney disease. Thepatient's Coumadin was held briefly in the setting of acoagulopathy that she developed on 1/27/06 .  The patient wasevaluated by the Hematology Service and was seen by Dr. Codilla andDr. Vallas from the Hematology Service for workup of hercoagulopathy. The patient had elevation of her INR to 5.8 and aslight reduction in her hematocrit to 25 , as well as elevation ofher PTT to 97. Workup included factor 7 level , mixing study ,anticardiolipin antibody , lupus anticoagulant , Von Willebrand'spanel , hepatitis B and C testing as well as complement levels.The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells as wellas 2 units of FFP on 1/27/06 as well as vitamin K with muchimprovement in her coagulopathy and increase in her hematocrit toabout 29. The patient should not receive anyheparin flushes. The patient showed no evidence for DIC orhemolysis. Her coagulopathy was most likely thought to be due toresidual Coumadin with factor deficiency in the setting of herdecreased renal clearance. At this time , the results of theinhibitor screen are pending and should be followed up as anoutpatient. The patient was restarted on Coumadin prior todischarge. Her INR goal is 2 to 3 and her Coumadin dosing shouldbe monitored by Dr. Hynum . Her current Coumadin dose is 1 mgp.o. once every evening and her most recent INR 1.2. The patientwill follow up with Hematology as an outpatient.Infectious Disease: The patient had a wound culture that grewpseudomonas for which she was briefly treated with a course ofceftazidime. The patient completed a course of ceftazidime andremained afebrile off antibiotics with no signs of activeinfection. A wound care consult was obtained for the patient'sdecubitus ulcer. She should have DuoDERM dressing applied everythree days to her ulcer.Pulmonary: The patient continues to have an oxygen requirementdespite diuresis. She did not show clinical signs of pneumonia.Her oxygen requirement is thought to be due to atelectasis ,deconditioning , as well as her known congestive heart failure andlikely pulmonary hypertension. She requires supplemental oxygenat 2 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations in themid 90s. This should be continued at her rehabilitation.Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and wasfollowed by the Diabetes Nursing Service during her stay. Shewas on Avandia during the admission in addition to Lantus andNovoLog before meals. Upon discharge , the patient will be onAvandia 4 mg p.o. every noon as well as NovoLog 4 unitssubcutaneous before every meals in addition to a NovoLog slidingscale. The patient was also started on thyroid supplementationand will be on Synthroid as an outpatient.Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient had hyponatremiathought to be in the setting of volume overload and total bodywater excess. This improved somewhat with diuresis. Inaddition , the patient developed dysphagia with liquids during herhospitalization. She was evaluated by the Speech and SwallowService and had evidence of aspiration on bedside swallowexamination as well as video swallow examination. The patientwas also evaluated by the ENT Service and was seen by Dr.Cassetty on 11/26/06 .  On laryngoscopy , she was found to have aleft vocal cord paralysis. She underwent MRI imaging of her neckand chest. She did not have any evidence of mediastinal mass andno abnormalities of the recurrent laryngeal nerve were seen.Gradually , the patient has had some mild improvement in herhoarseness and dysphagia. She benefits from turning her head tothe left with each swallow to minimize the risk of aspiration.The patient was also followed by the Nutrition Service throughouther hospital stay.Vascular: The patient is status post left femoral distal bypasson 8/21/06 .  The patient continued to be followed by theVascular Surgery Service during her hospitalization. She shouldhave three t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressings applied to her left lowerextremity up to her thigh daily. She will follow up in VascularClinic with Dr. Skreen in two weeks upon discharge.Allergy: The patient had a DIURIL induced drug rash. She showedno signs of mucous membrane involvement and no signs ofStevens-Johnson syndrome.Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on a PPI as well as herCoumadin.Disposition: The patient was followed by the Physical TherapyService while an inpatient and will benefit from inpatientrehabilitation.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.8h. as needed forpain , aspirin 81 mg p.o. once a day , allopurinol 100 mg p.o. oncea day , amitriptyline 10 mg p.o. twice a day , Plavix 75 mg p.o.once a day , Aranesp 40 mcg subcutaneous q. week , Benadryl 25 mgp.o. every six hours as needed for itching , Colace 100 mg p.o.twice a day , flecainide 75 mg p.o. q.12h. , NovoLog sliding scalebefore meals and every evening - if fingerstick less than 125give zero units , if fingerstick 125-150 give 2 units , iffingerstick 151-200 give 3 units , if fingerstick 201-250 give 4units , if fingerstick 251-300 then give 6 units , if fingerstick301-350 then give 8 units , if fingerstick 351-400 then give 10units and call physician if fingerstick greater than 400 or lessthan 70 , NovoLog 40 units subcutaneous before meals - pleasehold if n.p.o. , levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. once daily , milk ofmagnesia 30 mL p.o. daily as needed for constipation , metoprolol12.5 mg p.o. q.6h. -hold if systolic blood pressure less than 90or heart rate less than 55-to be discontinued after one day.

931671366 | RH | 06109053 | | 276286 | 2/2/2002 12:00:00 AM | SCIATICA | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 10/11/2002 Report Status: SignedDischarge Date: 3/27/2002CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sciatica.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Forty-six-year-old fell out of bedyesterday reaching for something. Shefell on her coccyx. She had no loss of consciousness , no headtrauma. She was unable to get up secondary to pain and bodyhabitus. EMS was called and returned patient to bed , however , sherefused to come into the hospital in spite of her pain. Thefollowing morning she was still with consider lower back andbuttock pain radiating to her right leg. She took her normaloxycodone and Vicodin doses without relief , and EMS brought thepatient to the hospital. The patient states that pain is likeprevious episodes of sciatica , radicular pain , but exacerbated byher fall. In the emergency department , patient was afebrile , vitalsigns stable. She received Ativan , Motrin , Dilaudid with littleeffect. Plain films were negative for fracture. She was unable toambulate , and therefore admitted.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus , myocardial infarction non-Q-waveSeptember , 2001 , a MICU admission during that time , in September , 2001 ,for urosepsis , diabetic ketoacidosis and this non-Q-wave MI. Also ,sciatica with previous history of a herniated disc L5-S1 , questionobstructive sleep apnea with mild pulmonary hypertension byprevious echo.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateralsalpingo-oophorectomy complicated by woundinfection.MEDICATIONS: Zocor , Zestril , aspirin , Toprol , morphine , insulinand Vicodin.STUDIES: September , 2001 , MIBI showed an old , moderately sized MIin mid LAD distribution with moderate residualperi-infarct ischemia. An September , 2001 , echo showed leftventricular ejection fraction 50% , hypokinesis in the inferiorseptum , mildly enlarged RV , pulmonary artery pressures of 39 plusRA , suggestive of mild pulmonary hypertension and mild MR and TR.LABORATORY DATA: On admission , labs were significant for a glucoseof 121 , creatinine 1.4 , baseline was one ,potassium of 5.2 , CK of 355 , a UA with plus two leukocyte esterase ,85 whites , plus two bacteria.PHYSICAL EXAM: Patient had temperature of 99 , heart rate 67 ,respirations of 17 , blood pressure 130/50 , andsaturation 97% on room air. She was in no distress. She wasobese. She had no head trauma. Her neck was supple , normal S1 ,S2. Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomenwas markedly obese , positive bowel sounds , nontender. She had askin abrasion on her left elbow. She had no spinal tenderness , nopelvic tenderness. She was unable to raise her right leg secondaryto pain. She did have pain with straight leg left on the right.She had normal sensation in upper and lower extremities.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted and was scheduled to undergoan MRI for evaluation of acutely herniated discat an outside facility at Y Wau Topelum , secondary to not being able tofit within the coils at our own facility. However , she was unableto receive this MRI secondary to inability to have assistance withtransfer of her when she reached the facility. Initially , her painwas managed with both immediate-release and sustained-releasemorphine and Valium for spasm. She also received around-the-clockhigh-dose NSAIDs and was evaluated by physical therapy andnutrition. Her UTI was treated with Bactrim. On hospital daythree , her creatinine jumped to 2.9 from 1.4. She was alsohyperkalemic to 5.9. Her NSAIDs were stopped and Neurontin wasDCed secondary to somnolence. However , she continued to haveworsening renal failure , hypertension and somnolence , and blood gasshowed primary respiratory acidosis , hypercarbia and she wasultimately transferred to the MICU for intubation for airwayprotection secondary to aspiration. By April , her creatinine hadreturned to baseline. She was extubated without complications.Her renal function was presumed to be secondary high-dose NSAIDs ,and her intubation was deemed to be secondary to a primaryrespiratory acidosis from opioid intoxication exacerbated by renalfailure. Issues are as follows by systems:Pulmonary: Overnight pulse oximetry was performed , which will beanalyzed to assess for obstructive sleep apnea. Patient will mostlikely need a form of sleep study at rehabilitation or as anoutpatient to address this obstructive sleep apnea issue. Datafrom this admission do not support a diagnosis of obesityhypoventilation syndrome , because there was no daytime hypercapniaby both ABGs and Chem-7 panel.Renal: Acute renal insufficiency resolved with hydration ,withdrawal of NSAIDs. We will hold her ACE inhibitor secondary torecent renal failure , and she will need to have this evaluated intwo weeks or so.Infectious disease: The patient with low-grade fevers on empiricLevofloxacin and Flagyl day seven of 14 for aspiration pneumoniasuffered during hypocarbic respiratory arrest. The patient wasalso placed on two days of vancomycin , after one of the bloodcultures in the ICU grew coagulase negative Staph. All culturessince then have been negative. Patient also had two episodes ofliquid stool on Flagyl , day six. She was already receiving therapyfor C. difficile. Because she has been in the hospital more thanthree days , an O&P is very low yield. Stool cultures and a repeatchest x-ray will be done if clinical worsens tomorrow.Neurologic: Patient with known small right lateral recess discherniation impinging on right nerve root at L5-S1. She hasprevious received steroid injections for this and has refusedsurgery secondary to very bad experience with the total abdominalhysterectomy complicated by wound infection. She has had an acuteexacerbation of this pain with her fall. We were unable to obtainan MRI at outside facility because of her body habitus and need forassistance with movement. She would benefit from aggressive PT andpain control with eventual surgery if these more conservativemeasures fail.Pain: The patient was oversedated on pain medications and wasactually intubated for the need to balance desire to alleviate painwith need for patient to have adequate respiratory drive.Endocrine: Continue NPH and CZI and ADA diet. Will begin Meridia.Patient also seen by nutrition and was given number for weight lossprogram.CV: Non-Q-wave MI in September , 2001. Patient with preserved EF , novalve disease. Will continue current cardiac regimen. Will needto restart ACE inhibitor in two to three weeks , now that renalfailure resolved.Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous Heparin , Protime pump inhibitor , andDulcolax and Lactulose p.r.n. for constipation while on narcotics.Social: I have written a letter regarding the patient's need forfirst-floor apartment secondary to inability to use stairs.

Shewas recently discharged from the Tohall Villeviewtrom Moralb Medical Center on10/8/05 after admission for UTI and acute renal failure in thesetting of NSAID abuse because of low back pain. She wasdischarged to the nursing home on that day and experienced mildnausea and emesis that evening. Her symptoms progressed over thenight and continued throughout the next day , and she presentedwith complaints of coffee-ground emesis without melena ,dizziness , orthostasis , or palpitations. She has no abdominalpain , diarrhea , or constipation. She did have a history of sickcontact , her previous roommate , during the hospitalization hadgastroenteritis. Therefore , on 9/29/05 , she was transferredfrom the nursing home to the Baview Hospital And Medical Center forevaluation of the hematemesis.PERTINENT REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:She denied any symptoms of orthostasis. She denied any visualcomplaints , dizziness , or imbalance. She had no incontinence ,dysuria , frequency , or urgency. She had no chest pain and noshortness of breath.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:NPH subcutaneously 35 units q.a.m. , NPH subcutaneously 10 unitsq.p.m. , NovoLog sliding scale , Reglan 5 mg by mouth twice a day ,Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice a day for 14 days and then oncedaily , Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day , Tylenol 1000mg by mouth three times a day , Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 mg inhaledas needed , Spiriva 18 mcg inhaled daily , Lipitor 10 mg by mouthdaily , PhosLo 667 mg by mouth before meals , Synthroid 200 mcg bymouth daily , miconazole nitrate 2% cream twice a day application ,Actonel 35 mg by mouth once a week , on Sunday , Detrol LA 4 mg bymouth daily , nifedipine XL , and Neurontin 300 mg by mouth daily.ALLERGIES:Include albuterol , which causes supraventricular tachycardia ,penicillin causes rash , ibuprofen , which causes acute renalfailure , and sulfa drugs , which cause an unknown reaction.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:On admission , the physical exam was notable for temperature 96.2 ,heart rate 87 , blood pressure 146/90 , respiratory rate 20 , and O2sat on room air is 93%. Her general physical examination showedno icterus and no conjunctivae pallor. Pulmonary exam wasbenign. Cardiovascular exam showed regular rate and rhythm , S1 ,S2 , occasional pauses , but good peripheral pulses. Abdominalexam showed an obese abdomen , normoactive bowel sounds , soft ,nontender , and nondistended. The exam of the extremities showedpitting edema to the knee , otherwise was nontender and she hasgood muscle strength throughout. The neurological exam wasnonfocal. The vomitus was examined and it was shown to begastroccult negative.LABORATORY DATA:Pertinent laboratory findings showed sodium of 140 , chloride of102 , bicarbonate of 19 , creatinine of 2.6 , down from max of over6 , anion gap 19 , glucose on chemistry 351 , normal liver test ,hematocrit of 36.8 within her normal range , and normal coags.OPERATIONS OR PROCEDURES PERFORMED NOT IN OR:She had an upper GI series on 8/30/05 , a video swallow on1/19/05 , and upper endoscopy on 11/6/05 .HOSPITAL COURSE:In summary , in terms of the hematemesis from the GI standpoint ,there was no blood shown in the emesis during thehospitalization. Her symptoms were treated with Reglan ,initially IV than p.o. The differential diagnosis on admissionwas gastroenteritis due to sick contacts , gastritis secondary topervious history of NSAID use , ulcer , recurrent esophagealstricture , other enteritis or DKA given elevated glucose levelsand anion gap on admission. Other things considered wereatypical cardiac ischemia. In order to evaluate the cause of thehematemesis , she underwent the barium swallow on 8/30/05 .Unfortunately , this test was canceled prematurely due to evidenceof aspiration on the initial swallow. She was kept n.p.o. from10/21/05 to 07 until video swallow could be performed ,which showed minimal aspiration with swallowing , but wasimproved with chin tuck maneuver. An initial diet of mechanicalsoft with liquids was recommended with advancement as necessary.GI was consulted , Dr. Costine attending , and upper endoscopywas performed on 11/6/05 , which showed nonerosive esophagitisand a hiatal hernia , both known by history , otherwise , there wasno ulcerations and no stricture. The emesis subsided during thehospitalization. She was continued on Nexium while in-house aswell as Reglan p.r.n. and tolerated regular house feeds prior todischarge with no emesis. As an aside , she developed diarrheawhile in-house. Given history of pervious antibiotic use forUTI , C. diff cultures were sent , both are pending at this time.The suspicion is low. She is being treated with Imodium p.r.n.In terms of her history of acute renal failure , the creatininehad continued to decrease through her hospitalization , but afteraggressive diuresis , she had slight increase in her creatinine ,but this responded well to reducing the rate of Lasix and mildhydration. From a cardiovascular standpoint , her hospital staywas complicated by two distinct episodes of supraventriculartachycardia with rapid ventricular response , one on 11/27/05 andone on 9/9/05 .  The event on 11/27/05 occurred at 5:00 p.m.with heart rates in 200 range. She was treated with Lopressor 5mg followed by diltiazem 20 mg x2 , which then caused reduction inthe heart rate to the 90s. Diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. was thenadded to her regimen. On 9/9/05 , at 2:00 a.m. , she had heartrate to the 160s , again was treated with diltiazem 20 mg IV x1and her heart rate decreased to the 90s. At that time , herdiltiazem dose was increased to 90 mg q.i.d. From an infectiousdisease standpoint , there were no obvious infections diagnosedduring this stay , but the results of stool cultures are pending.Her pulmonary status remained stable with good O2 saturation onroom air throughout the hospitalization. From an endocrinestandpoint , her diabetes was moderately controlled during herhospitalization. She was switched from her standing NPH toregular insulin sliding scale while n.p.o. because of low bloodsugars. After initiating p.o. intake , her sugars were initiallyuncontrolled and aggressively managed with Regular Insulinsliding scale in addition to an NPH standing regimen. Upondischarge , Ms. Azen was afebrile with heart rate of 72 , range68-93 , normotensive with the blood pressure of 120/50 with goodO2 saturation on room air of 93%. Her cardiac and pulmonaryexams were benign. Abdomen exam was also benign , but symptoms ofloose bowel movements were still notable without abdominal pain.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. for pain , headache , ortemperature , diltiazem 90 mg p.o. four times a day , Lasix 40 mgby mouth daily , NPH 10 units subcutaneously nightly , NPH 40 unitssubcutaneously q.a.m. , Atrovent inhaler two puffs inhaled fourtimes a day , Synthroid 200 mcg p.o. daily , Imodium 2 mg p.o.q.6h. , Spiriva 18 mcg inhaled daily , Reglan 10 mg by mouth fourtimes a day as needed for nausea , Lipitor 10 mg by mouth daily ,Protonix 40 mg by mouth daily , KCl slow release 20 mEq by mouthtwice a day , miconazole nitrate 2% powder topical TP b.i.d. , andNovoLog sliding scale subcutaneously before meals and at bedtime.CONSULTANTS:The following consultants were used in her case: GI , Dr.Gornto , 098-4680 and Speech and Swallow , Clayton Tattrie , beepernumber 57221.PENDING TESTS:Clostridium difficile stool culture.FOLLOW UP PLANS:Ms. Kid will follow up with her primary care physician Dr.Samual Camus on Wednesday , 3/29/05 at 3:00 p.m.ADVANCE DIRECTIVE:She was full code.eScription document: 2-8328468 EMSDictated By: LOVERA , TEDAttending: PLANCARTE , FREDDIEDictation ID 5301263D: 6/22/05T: 6/22/05

The patient firstexperienced a sudden onset of substernal chest pressure and severeshortness of breath five days prior to admission which resolved inone hour but continued to have some substernal chest pain anddyspnea on exertion with even mild exertion , i.e , crossing theroom. This occurred over the next several days. The patientdescribed the substernal chest pressure as being like hit in thechest and this lasted about fifteen minutes. The patient did havesome nausea and vomiting associated with her symptoms and was mostcomfortable sitting up. The patient did continue to have increasedshortness of breath at rest and worsened dyspnea on exertion witharound two episodes per day of severe chest pressure/dyspnea/painthat required her to remain still over the next five days. Shealso noted diaphoresis with all those episodes. She denied anyfever , chills , URI symptoms , cough , change in bowel movements. Thepatient did complain of some bilateral foot edema 1-2 weeks priorto admission. The patient has had stable two-pillow orthopnea andnotes no weight gain or loss , but notes decreased exercisetolerance over the past month. The patient presented to herprimary care physician today secondary to continued shortness ofbreath and was sent to the emergency department whereelectrocardiogram revealed some ST depressions anterolaterally witha troponin leak with a troponin level of 0.19 and was thus admittedto the cardiology Memp Mont service.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus x 30years , hypertension , IPF diagnosed in 1986treated with digoxin and prednisone , osteoarthritis , obesity ,pneumonia , colonic polyps with guaiac-positive stool , TKR on 9/30 ,cholecystectomy , Bell's palsy x 20 years , LBP , right cataracts ,catheterization in 1998 showed a LAD lesion of 40% and a circlesion of 30% , RCA lesion of 30%.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Captopril 50 mg b.i.d.; Lasix 40 mgq.d.; Lopid 600 mg b.i.d.; Axid 150 mgb.i.d.; insulin 70/30 90 q. a.m. and 40 q. p.m.; atenolol 50 mgq.d.ALLERGIES: IV contrast , patient gets hives.

Chest x-ray: Positive for mildpulmonary edema , retrocardial infiltrate and left effusion.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 65-year-old female with a history ofcoronary artery disease , hypertension , diabetes ,IPF who presented with five days of chest pain/SOB beginning withsudden onset five days prior to admission and had EKG changesconsistent with a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction anterolaterally.Of note her troponin was 0.19. The differential diagnosis includedunstable angina and PE with worsening IPF superimposed on heartdisease. From a cardiovascular standpoint the patient has knowncoronary artery disease with EKG changes which is likely statuspost non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a question of continuedunstable angina. The patient was initially put on aspirin ,Lopressor 37.5 t.i.d. , heparin , oxygen and hooked up to a cardiacmonitor and EKG q.d. and was ruled out for enzymes. The patientunderwent cardiac catheterization which revealed LAD ostial 90% ,proximal 80% , diag ostial 90% , left circ 90% , 80% lesions , marginal1 , TUB 90% , RCA 50%. The patient underwent PTCA and stent x 2 withgood results. The patient remained chest pain free and had nochest pain on exertion , i.e. , with ambulation. The echo showedpreserved left ventricular function with a good ejection fraction.The ejection fraction was found to be 55%. There was no discreteevidence of wall motion abnormality although the inferior andposterior segments were not well visualized. There was leftventricular hypertrophy. There was stromal mild right ventricularhypertrophy and overall right heart function appeared to bepreserved. There was trivial to 1+ tricuspid regurgitation withright heart pressures within normal limits. There was thickenedaortic leaflets with trivial central insufficiency and no evidenceof any outflow tract obstruction. There was similar mild mitralregurgitation with the elliptic ring , the left atrial size wasslightly increased and there was no evidence of any effusion. Froma pulmonary standpoint the patient had LENIs which were negativefor a deep venous thrombosis. PFCs revealed a restrictivephysiology and poor diffusion consistent with IPF. The FEV1 was69% predicted , TLC was 63% predicted , with a DLCO of 56% predicted.The patient did have a retrocardiac infiltrate on chest x-ray andthe patient was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. for fourteendays. From a GI perspective the patient had a history of colonicpolyps but tolerated the aspirin and was put on Nexium prophylaxis.The patient was hypokalemic on 3/19 with a curious whitening onEKG and peak T waves. The patient was treated with insulin , givencalcium and treated with Kayexalate x 3 and the hypokalemia quicklyresolved. The origin of the hypokalemia was unclear. The patientdid have an elevated potassium with a low bicarb which wasconsistent with a type 4 RTA and also had hypoglycemia which wasthen treated with prednisone overnight for IV contrast dye allergy.The patient was also on Captopril which was discontinued secondaryto her renal issues.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o.q.d.; atenolol 75 mg p.o.b.i.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d.; Lopid 600 mgp.o. b.i.d.; nitroglycerin 1/150 one tab q. 5 minutes x 3 p.r.n.chest pain; Zocor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Norvasc 5 mg p.o.q.d.; xalatanone drop OU q.h.s.; Alphagan one drop OU b.i.d.; levofloxacin 500mg p.o.q.d.; clopidogrel 75 mg p.o.q.d.; insulin 70/30 90 units q.a.m. , 40 units q. p.m. subcu; Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.Dictated By: GARTH KILLE , M.D. UH455Attending: NORMAND PERRUZZA , M.D. XQ42  BQ182/241714Batch: 51972 Index No. QDRBAC0EPP D: 4/16/02T: 4/16/02

On 5/24/05 , he presented with shortnessof breath as well as a witnessed apneic episode. His recenthistory is significant for having stopped his Lasix dose one weekprior to admission due to increased frustration withincontinence. Since then , he has had increasing shortness ofbreath , orthopnea , bilateral lower edema , and dyspnea on exertionto the point of symptoms upon walking 10 feet. In the Centsshealt Careman Inerist Medical Center Emergency Department , he was found to besaturating 91% on room air and 99% on a nonrebreather. An ABGshowed a pH of 7.31 and a PCO2 of 55; he was tried on BiPAPwithout improvement in either PCO2 or PO2. While beinginterviewed by the medical residents , he was seen to have a30-second apneic episode with loss of consciousness and cyanosis;his sensorium quickly returned after this event , although heretained no memory of this occurrence. He received Lasix 80 mgx1 , Solu-Medrol , and DuoNebs in the ED. He was admitted to theCCU initially with CHF/apnea/sinus arrest , and subsequentlytransferred to the hospital floor when he was stable.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.

Cardiovascular: Ischemia: No active issues during thishospitalization. Pump: The patient had a history nonischemicdilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF , ( an echo during thishospitalization revealed an EF of 55% without hypokinesis ,although prior echo in 2003 showed an EF of 35% with global leftventricular hypokinesis ). On admission , the patient had signsand symptoms of volume overload in a setting of having not takenhis Lasix for about a week. He was admitted initially to theCCU , and subsequently transferred to the floor , with aggressivediuresis of approximately 10 kg since admission ( includingdiuresis with ultrafiltration in the CCU ). Following transfer tothe floor , he was switched to Lasix diuresis , which was titrateddown gradually to 40 mg daily , ( cautioned with administrationgiving a rise in creatinine ). The patient was also maintained oncaptopril , which was up titrated to 25 mg t.i.d. ( held at onepoint due to the rise in the creatinine ). The patient was alsotitrated up on metoprolol to 25 mg b.i.d. Rhythm: The patientwas followed by the Electrophysiology Service. In the CCU , hewas noted to have sinus arrest of 8-9 seconds in the setting ofapnea. Following transfer to the floor , he was noted to havesinus arrest of 4 seconds , again in the setting of apnea. Hislast such episode was on 8/16/05 .  In addition , the patient hashistory of atrial fibrillation/flutter , status post ablation. On4/30/05 , he underwent pacemaker placement through cephalicveins , which he tolerated well.2. Pulmonary: The patient , as noted above , had several episodesof apnea , some of which were associated with sinus arrest.Following diuresis , the patient's apnea episodes improved. Hewas recommended for formal sleep study as an outpatient.3. Renal: The patient was admitted with a creatinine roughlyaround baseline ( 2 ) , which rose briskly during hishospitalization to a peak of 3.2 on 4/30/05 .  His FENa onadmission was 6-8%; a repeat FENa in the setting of his peakserum creatinine of 3.2 and following 10 kg of diuresis was1.86%. His urine eosinophils were negative. His UA showedevidence of a UTI plus triple phosphate crystals; urine cultureshowed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of mixed morphology. It wasthought that the rise in the patient's creatinine was likely dueto a combination of intravascular depletion and possibly UTI.The patient was started on antibiotics following his pacemakerplacement , which would be expected to cover GU microbial floraand SNHU microbes.4. Endocrine: The patient had a history of diabetes and wasmaintained on a Regular Insulin sliding scale.5. ID: The patient was expected to having an UTI as notedabove. Following his pacemaker placement , he was placed oncefazolin while in-house , followed by Keflex. The patient shouldstay on Keflex for four days.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.

Normal S1 and S2 , his JVP was noted to be at the jaw.Lungs: Remarkable for diffuse wheezes. Abdomen: Obese ,nontender , without masses. Extremities: He had bilateralpitting edema , left lower extremity was noted to be erythematousto the inguinal crease with weeping. He was neurologicallynonfocal.ADMISSION LABS:Remarkable for sodium of 129 , potassium 5.7 , creatinine of 1.5 upfrom his baseline 0.9-1.3 , BUN of 30. Magnesium 1.6 , INR 2.8%.First set of cardiac enzymes were negative with a BNP of 127.WBC is 28.5 , hematocrit 34.7 , platelets of 189 , baselinehematocrit is usually in the high 20s. Differential: Notablefor 97 neutrophils and 20 bands.EKG remarkable for atrial fibrillation with a rate of 82 , Q-wavesin V1 and V2 without ST changes , low voltage. His T-wave wasupright in V2 and V3 which is changed from his prior EKG in11/26 .  Chest x-ray notable for pericardial effusion whichshows increase in size and question of fluid at the bilateralbases.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:Mr. Inskeep is a 74-year-old man with severe venous stasis , CHF ,atrial fibrillation requiring Coumadin , COPD , severe left lowerextremity cellulitis status post surgical debridement whopresents with shortness of breath and recurrent left lowerextremity cellulitis.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular: The patient had some pseudonormalization inV2 , V3. He was ruled out for MI. He was continued on hisaspirin and Zocor. His CK was noted to be increasing , but he wasclinically unchanged , and there was low suspicion for necrotizingfasciitis or myositis. He was not felt to be cardiac in origin.The patient has right heart failure. He was overloaded on exam.His JVP was difficult to assess given his history of tricuspidregurgitation. He did have enlarged heart on his chest x-ray andan echo on 1/3/06 showed a precordial fat-pad without effusion.His EF was unchanged. His PA pressure was 35+ RA. His IVC wasnonpulsatile suggesting increased RA pressures. He responded toLasix 80 mg IV. He was not diuresed on this admission. He wascontinued on his home dose of Lasix at 80 mg p.o. twice daily.2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has no need for ratecontrol at this time. Coumadin was held for GI bleeding that thepatient developed on 6/10/06 .  He had an episode of hematemesisin the setting of an INR of 3 which was thought to be aMallory-Weiss tear from coughing. His hematocrit stabilized at27. His fibrinogen D-dimer were normal. He was made n.p.o. ,received four units of FFP and 2 units of packed red cells. AnNG tube was placed which has been since removed. The GI Servicerecommended an IV proton pump inhibitor. On 11/9/06 , his dietwas advanced. He was tolerating that well and his hematocritswere stable at this point.3. Respiratory: The patient had wheeziness on exam when he wasadmitted. He received DuoNebs q.6h. and on exam , his wheezinessresolved.4. ID: The patient has recurrent cellulitis secondary to venousstasis. Cultures from the debridement in 11/26 were negative.Blood cultures drawn p.r.n. 6/7/06 were positive foracinetobacter diphtheroids. Wound cultures of the left legshowed 2+ acinetobacter , beta streptococcus group Gcorynebacterium. From the right leg , he grew 2+ MRSA ,corynebacterium and beta strep. The organisms were sensitive tolevofloxacin , his staph aureus MRSA. Blood culture 6/10/06 isno growth to date at the time of this dictation. Stool on6/10/06 was positive for C. diff and urine culture 1/3/06showed Gram-negative rods. Surgical Service recommendedantibiotic treatment. The patient was started on vancomycin( started 6/7/06 ) , levofloxacin ( started 6/7/06 ) , aztreonamwas added on 1/3/06 for Acinetobacter in his blood. Hewas given gentamicin x1 on 6/10/06 in the setting ofhypotension. He will continue vancomycin and levofloxacin forfour weeks and will stop on 6/13/06 .  He will continue Flagylfor six weeks ( started 8/27/06 to stop on 10/11/07 for his C.diff ). The wound culture from his bilateral lower extremities ispolymicrobial. If the erythema spread , he becomes febrile , or hislegs become more tender , please have a low threshold fornoncontrast CT and surgical consultation. Lower extremityDopplers were negative for DVT but there is incompletevisualization at all of his left leg veins.5. Renal: The patient had acute on chronic renal failure ,( baseline creatinine 0.9-1.1 ) , hyponatremia , hyperkalemia onadmission. There was some question of adrenal insufficiency buthe had a normal random cortisol. His fractional excretion ofurea was 26% and he has since been volume resuscitated. Hiscreatinine responded accordingly.6. Prophylaxis: The patient has been on Coumadin that was heldin the setting of GI bleed. We have held his Lovenox as well.He is on an oral proton pump inhibitor.CODE STATUS:The patient is DNR/DNI. Pressors are okay. Healthcare proxy isHal Feucht who is his sister 624-913-9792.CONSULTS:GI: Dr. Nagai . ID: Dr. Furr . Surgery: Dr. Myles Messel .TO DO:1. Continue IV antibiotics.2. Follow up all cultures.3.

The patient had no chestpain history until 1992 when she presented with chest pain and hada markedly positive exercise tolerance test. She had recurrenttypical chest pain and fatigue at 3 minutes and 45 seconds onstandard Bruce protocol with a maximal heart rate of 129 , maximalblood pressure 120/80 , and 1 mm ST depressions. Patient wastreated medically but returned with chest pain at rest. Cardiaccatheterization revealed single vessel coronary artery disease ( 80%mid right coronary artery ) for which a PTCA was attempted but wascomplicated by dissection so the patient had an emergent saphenousvein graft to the right coronary artery and LIMA to the leftanterior descending. Patient was on an intraaortic balloon pumpwhen she developed a cold right lower extremity and had an emergentright femorofemoral bypass. The patient did well until 2/11 ( withrare episodes approximately four per year of rest angina whichbegan approximately six months post-coronary artery bypass graftand were all relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin ) when shedeveloped worsening right lower extremity claudication requiringangioplasty. In 4/17 , recurrent right lower extremityclaudication prompted a femoropopliteal bypass. The patient wasnow currently contemplating repeat femoropopliteal bypass. On theday of admission , the patient had an approximately four hourepisode of chest pain while visiting with her daughter. Thepatient did not have sublingual nitroglycerin with her at the time.Upon returning home , the patient obtained relief with onesublingual nitroglycerin ( patient had described the pain at 9/10with left chest to axilla pain and no other radiation ). Thepatient was able to sleep. The patient awoke in the morning andshortly thereafter , had chest pain which was not relieved with onesublingual nitroglycerin. Therefore , the patient came to theEmergency Department. The patient had repeat episodes of chestpain while in the Emergency Department and no EKG changes werenoted. Two sublingual nitroglycerins resolved each episode.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Longstanding hypertension. 2 ) Pepticulcer disease/upper gastrointestinal bleedin the 1970s.

NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly non-focalexcept for 4/5 right lower extremity proximal muscle strength , 1+deep tendon reflexes throughout , and toes downgoing bilaterally.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a hematocritof 49 and first CK of 19. Chest x-rayshowed no active disease. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm of 90 ,axis 70 degrees , normal intervals , no ST or T wave changes , no leftventricular hypertrophy , and no change as compared with 4/17 .HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was first ruled out for a myocardialinfarction and the patient did , in fact , ruleout. The patient did have some recurrent chest pain episodesin-house , again with no EKG changes , relieved with sublingualnitroglycerin. Her anti-ischemic regimen was intensified and thepatient underwent a dobutamine MIBI which revealed inferiorischemia with a minimal work-load. Cardiac catheterizationrevealed that her saphenous vein graft to the right coronary arteryhad stenosed which was successfully PTCA to 20% residual stenosis.Slow competitive flow was seen in the LIMA but the LIMA to the leftanterior descending was patent.

Her right eye isapproximately 3 mm. She has moist mucous membrane. She has asmall erosion on the right upper gum. There is no erythema orexudate seen within the tonsils. Neck: JVP noted to beapproximately 6 cm. Her neck is supple. There was full range ofmotion. There are no carotid bruits and there is nolymphadenopathy present. Cardiovascular: Heart is of regularrate and rhythm with occasional premature beats. She has a S1and S2 that are mechanical in nature. She has a 3/6 holosystolicmurmur heard at the apex. There are no rubs or gallopsappreciated. She additionally has a right RV heave. Her PMI isdiffuse , but nondisplaced. Chest: Faint crackles at the leftbase , otherwise clear. No wheezes or rhonchi are heard.Abdomen: Slightly tympanic. Her right lower quadrant isslightly tender. She has active bowel sounds. Her liver edge isnot palpable. The spleen tip is nonpalpable. Extremities:Warm , 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. She does have some1+ lower extremity edema on the right greater than the left. Itis slightly pitting.LABORATORY EXAM ON ADMISSION: Sodium 126 , potassium 4.4 ,chloride 93 , bicarbonate 24 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.4 with abaseline of 1.2 and 1.3 , glucose 160. CBC is notable for a whiteblood cell count of 9.9 , hematocrit 27.9 , platelet count 274 , 000.Her liver function tests are notable for ALT 56 , AST 83 ,alkaline phosphatase is 52 , total bilirubin 0.1 , albumin 4.2 , andtotal protein 7.4.STUDIES: Her EKG showed no change. It was in junctional rhythmat 65 beats per minute. She had frequent PVCs. There was anormal access. There were some nonspecific T-wave inversions.CHEST X-RAY: Showed mild vascular congestion. There was noevidence of any effusion.IMPRESSION: This is a 59-year-old female with a rheumatic heartdisease , status post St. Jude's MVR and AVR , congestive heartfailure who presents with mild volume overload and abdominal painwith nausea and vomiting.BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular:a. Ischemia: When the patient was admitted , she was ruled outfor an MI. She did have a slight increase of her troponins ,which were attributed to mild demand ischemia. In addition , shehad some slight anemia , which could also be contributed to thedemand as well in addition to the clear volume overload. She didfine from the standpoint , had no ST changes on any of her EKGs.The patient laid her head workup for future AVR and MVR with theSurgical Service , with Dr. Bio . Her workup was extensive andincluded a cardiac catheterization , which showed no significantcoronary artery disease. The hemodynamics were notable for thefollowing: RA of 12 , PA of 92/23/44 , pulmonary capillary wedgepressure of 22 with V waves to 42. The mitral valve was grosslynormal with appropriate leaflet motion. The AV was also grossly.The overall conclusion was elevated right-sided heart pressures.She had no evidence of major atherosclerotic disease of thecoronary arteries.b. Pump: Please see cath report as above. The patient wasadmitted and diuresed with IV Lasix , so she came down to aeuvolemic state. Her diuresis was continued with 80 mg IV Lasixon a b.i.d. basis. She was diuresed until there was a subsequentbump in her creatinine to 1.8 , 1.9. After that point , diuresiswas slowly modified. She was then placed back on a regimen of120 mg of p.o. Lasix q.o.d. That is the dosing of Lasix on whichshe is discharged.c. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrialfibrillation that has been rate controlled with a beta-blocker.On admission , her digoxin was stopped. She was evaluated by theEP Service. They recommended epicardial lead placement atsurgery due to her tachybrady syndrome. The patient wasdischarged on diltiazem 30 mg q.i.d. She will have hermedications modified status post her valvular repair in the verynear future.d. Presurgical workup: In addition to echo , right and leftheart cath , the patient had a TEE performed. TEE showed normalleft atrial appendage without evidence of localized thrombus.St. Jude's valve was well seated in the aortic position. Therewas no significant aortic regurg that was noted. A St. Jude'svalve was well seated in the mitral position as well. There wastrace mild regurgitation noted. There was slight asynchronousmotion of the prosthetic valve apparatus that was noted. Thetricuspid valve was normal in appearance. There was mildregurgitation present. Visualized portion of the thoracic aortarevealed minimal atheromatous plaque.2. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from her pulmonarystandpoint. She continued to sat well on room air. She did notrequired any nebulizers during her stay.3. GI: The patient was initially admitted with some abdominalpain and also nausea and vomiting. She had a KUB performed for aquestion of potential bowel obstruction. A single frontal viewof the abdomen was obtained and is reported in the finalradiology report. There was gas seen within the loops of smallbowel as well as the colon. There is no bowel dilatation seen.The overall impression was no evidence of any high-grade bowelobstruction. It is likely that some of her pain was secondary tohepatic congestion. The nausea and vomiting eventually resolvedand perhaps this is some type of viral illness orgastroenteritis. She did have some episode of diarrhea prior toadmission along with some abdominal cramping. The patient wascontinued on her PPI for GERD prophylaxis. At one point , sherequired increasing her dosage of Nexium secondary to GERD-likesymptoms. It seemed that increasing the amount of Nexium shereceived , precipitated some diarrhea. She was returned to anormal dosing of Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. while in-house. She wasdischarged on omeprazole 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , which she willcontinue to take as an outpatient. In addition , she was givenprescription for Colace and also Senokot today. She shouldcontinue using.4. Heme: Her hematocrit remained relatively stable during herstay with averaging of 26 to 27 as far as her hematocrit. Wewere not concerned with keeping her hematocrit 30 or above at alltimes given her clean coronary arteries seen from the left andalso right heart catheterization. She did have a slight dip inher hematocrit at one point requiring two units of packed redblood cells. Her hematocrit bumped appropriately to 30 or 31.She required no subsequent transfusions thereafter. With regardto anticoagulation , she was placed on the heparin drip at 950units per hour to maintain a PTT between 60 and 80 secondary toher mechanical valves that are in place. On discharge , thepatient was transitioned to Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. with a renaldosing. She will continue to take this Lovenox as an outpatientand stop it one to two days prior to her surgery as instructed.She has home VNA in place.5. Renal: Her BUN and creatinine was relatively stable onadmission. It did elevate to as high as 3.3 , 3.4 on heradmission secondary to her ongoing diuresis. When diuresis washeld for several days given her markedly increased urine outputand as she became more hydrated and euvolemic , her creatininereturned to its baseline of 1.2 , 1.3. She has no active issuesnow.6. Endocrine: We appreciated the Diabetes Service for followingher very closely while in-house. Several modifications were madeto her regimen while here to get good control of her bloodglucose. She was maintained on a stable regimen of NPH 60 unitsin the morning , NPH 30 units in the evening. She also was placedon a sliding scale. She also received NovoLog of 15 units in themorning with breakfast and also 15 at dinner. She was notreceiving any of the NovoLog while at lunch. She will continueto take this regimen in home. All of her prescriptions wereprovided by Carl Mcclenahan , who is following with the DiabetesService. They will become again involved with her care as sheplans for surgery in the very near future.7. Infectious disease: The patient was stable from an IDstandpoint during her entire admission. On September , 2005 , thepatient was noted to have an increase in her white blood cellcount upwards towards the 20 , 000. This was one day prior to aplanned surgery on April , 2005 with Dr. Villata to repair heraortic valve and also her mitral valve. The surgery was delayedas a result of this , so an infectious workup could ensue. Shehad a urine sent that showed , the suggestion of a urinary tractinfection. Levaquin was given for treatment of her UTI.Surveillance cultures were drawn daily. Given the fact that shehad a right groin hematoma that performed after the heartcatheterization we questioned whether or not this could be sometype of infectious source. She had the hematoma aspirated , itwas negative for any organisms. She had no other identifiedplaces as far as source of infection. It was believed that shecould potential have endocarditis as she has had in the past.One of her cultures actually grew out a species of Abiotrophia.There is only one culture positive , that was taken on February .She has had no subsequent cultures growing out at the time ofthis dictation. We appreciate the Infectious Disease Teamfollowing. Their recommendations were to hold antibiotics unlesssubsequent cultures began to grow out. Their recommendationswere to continue to follow all cultures and to perform a TEE. Arepeat TEE was performed and showed no evidence of any lesions orchange in bowel function. There were clearly no vegetation seenon either any transthoracic echos or TEEs. ID maderecommendations as far as perioperative antibiotics , which wouldinclude two weeks of ceftriaxone 1 g IV b.i.d. under theassumption that this would be completing a course of her therapyafter SBE. They would also recommend sending all valve tissuefor Gram stain and culture as well as pathology. If the Gramstain and culture were positive , they would suggest extending thecourse of the above-mentioned antibiotic therapy.8. Neurologic: The patient was given Darvon and also codeine asneeded for her pain. She complained of right groin painsecondary to the hematoma. Her pain is much improved that she isable to ambulate easily around the Tl Brown Vo on discharge. Thehematoma is resolving and her pain is resolving as well.9. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient istolerating p.o. well. Her electrolytes were repleted as neededdaily.10. Psychologic: The patient was seen by social work. It isclear that she has many anxieties about the surgery and also ingoing home and returning to her social environment. Shenecessitated volume prior to many procedures given her severeanxiety.11. Disposition: The patient is stable from a medicalstandpoint with all cultures clear and no evidence of activeinfection. Her white blood cell count is now normal. She is nowawaiting surgical repair of her valve and will have a surgeryscheduled with Dr. Berreth office in the next one to two weeks.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Diltiazem 30 mg p.o. q.6h.2. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.3. Lasix 120 mg p.o. q. other day.4. NPH 60 units in the morning.5. NPH 30 units in the evening.6. Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q. day.7. Senokot three tablets p.o. b.i.d.8.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.2. DIABETES.3. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.4. PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Giannone is a 60 year old woman withadult onset diabetes , hypertension , andsevere peripheral vascular disease status post cerebrovascularaccident in 1986 , who was recently admitted to Rahjo Voychusetts Medical Center between 7/8/23 with what was presumed to be anexacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and newonset congestive heart failure. PFT's during that admission showedFVC of 1.92 , 59% , FEV1 of 1.42 estimated at 55% and FEV1/FVC ratio94%. An echocardiogram performed during that admission showednormal left and right ventricular function and size. Since herdischarge , Ms. Gieck has become progressively weak and has notedgradually increasing shortness of breath on exertion. She deniesfevers and chills , reports a dry cough but no nausea or vomiting.The cough was nonproductive. She has had poor oral intake , however ,no change in her bowel habits and no symptoms consistent with anupper respiratory tract infection. She denies any episodes of chestpain , however , notes that she requires three pillows to sleep on ,new onset orthopnea and new onset pedal edema. She presented to theSi to the emergency department after havingincreased shortness of breath the night preceding the 6 of July and wasnoted on arrival to the emergency room to have a blood pressure of200/100 with an oxygen saturation on 100% face mask of 85%.Portable chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failureand she has been on Lasix , Morphine Sulfate , in addition tonebulizer treatment. She initially responded well to thistreatment , diuresing 1.4 liters in urine output and her O2saturation rose to 96% on six liters. At that point , she wastransferred to the floor to the general medical service. PASTMEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for cerebrovascular accident in 1986 ,diabetes mellitus since 1985 , she has been insulin dependent;hypertension; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructivepulmonary disease with a long history of smoking. MEDICATIONS ONADMISSION: Xanax .25 mg q hs p.r.n. , Lasix 20 mg po q.o.d. ,insulin NPH 32 units and 6 units Regular q a.m. , enteric coatedaspirin one tablet q day , Elavil 25 mg q hs , Proventil two puffs q6 p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY:Notable for both parents who died of myocardial infarctions , motherat age 65 and father at age 75 , both parents also had hypertensionand her mother had diabetes. She has several children , all of whomare in good health. She lives with daughter. She has a sixty packyear history of smoking but no longer smokes and denies any alcoholuse.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Obese , white female in mild respiratorydistress. Blood pressure 120/60 , heart rate120 , respiratory rate 16 , temperature 98 with oxygen saturation 94%on three liters. HEENT exam was notable for normocephalic ,atraumatic head. Extraocular movements were intact and pupils wereequal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation. Oropharynxwas clear and sclera were also clear and anicteric. Neck exam wassupple. Jugular venous pressure was 10 cm and the carotids werewithout bruits. Neck was without adenopathy. Lungs; ralesone-half way up from the bases bilaterally. Cardiac exam showedthat she was tachycardic but with a regular rhythm and S1 and S2were heard clearly with an S4 , there were no murmurs or rubs noted.Abdomen; notable for positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender ,non-distended , no hepatosplenomegaly and no other masses felt.Extremities; 2+ pitting edema bilaterally with 1+ DP and PT pulsesbilaterally without femoral bruits. Rectal exam showed no massesand was guaiac negative. Neuro exam; alert and oriented x3.Cranial nerves were bilaterally intact and motor strength was 5 outof 5 , and sensation was grossly intact as well as her coordination.Reflexes were symmetric and toes were bilaterally down-going.LABORATORY EVALUATION: On admission , sodium was 142 , potassium 4.6 ,chloride 106 , bicarbonate 24 , BUN 13 ,creatinine 0.7 , glucose 220. LFT's were within normal limits.Albumin was 3.1 , calcium 9.0 , cholesterol 208 , triglycerides 220.CBC showed a white count of 16 with hematocrit of 34.3 andplatelets 352 , MCV 91. The differential on her white countdemonstrated 82 polys , 12 lymphocytes , 5 monocytes , 1 eosinophil.Her first CK was 33 with no MB fraction and an arterial blood gas/showed pH of 7.41 , 31 , 77 , 23 , and 96%. Chest x-ray was consistentwith congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions andincreased pulmonary vascular redistribution. EKG showed sinustachycardia at 120 with normal intervals and axis , with someflattening in the STT waves in the lateral lead. Urinalysis wasnegative.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was initially admitted to the floor whereshe received another dose of IV Lasix and 30 mgpo Nifedipine. Twenty minutes later , patient was noted to behypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 70. She was given asmall IV bolus of 100 cc normal saline with no response to hersystolic blood pressure. She was noted to be nauseated and vomitedx1 with midscapular back pain but no chest pain. She was markedlydiaphoretic , but did not complain of palpitations. Her blood sugarwas 181 and EKG at that time showed further T-wave flattening ininferior leads. She was started on Dopamine 20 micrograms perkilograms with initially no response. At that time , she wastransferred to cardiac unit for further management. In the CCU ,she was weaned from IV Dobutamine and her blood pressures rapidlycame up to systolic blood pressure of 130. Her requirement foroxygen was weaned from 100% face mask to 3 liters via nasalcannula , with her O2 saturations remaining 94-95%. She was startedon a beta blocker and her rule out protocol for myocardialinfarction showed flat CK's , CK's numbering 33 , 58 , and 147 , withno MB fractions and no further EKG changes , and no further episodesof nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis. On the third hospital day ,she was transferred to the cardiology Lan Tempeo service. Soon aftertransfer , a routine 12 lead EKG revealed deepening and inversion ofT-waves in the lateral leads , as well as the inferior leads. Herheart rate at that time was 110 , blood pressure 130/90. She did notcomplain of chest pain , shortness of breath , or diaphoresis.Patient was given one tablet of sublingual Nitroglycerin with nochange in her heart rate and her blood pressure went to 180/60 andshe complained of a headache. She was given 5 mg IV push Lopressorq 5 minutes x3 with response of her heart rate to 90. EKG postintervention was without change and she was maintained on 3 litersoxygen via nasal cannula , without change in her O2 saturation. Atthat time , the patient was started on Heparin 5 , 000 units IV bolusand maintained at 1200 units per hour , and a rule out protocol wasagain started. Her CK's were flat and there were no further EKGchanges. The decision to proceed with cardiac catheterization waspresented to the patient and on the 4th hospital day , the patientinitially refused cardiac catheterization. However , after furtherconsideration , she agreed to cardiac catheterization on the 7thhospital day , 6/4/93 .  Because of her history of acute renalfailure with creatinine rising from baseline of 1 to 1.7 onprevious admission with the initiation of Captopril , she hadconcurrently an abdominal aortogram to rule out renal arterystenosis. Her right heart catheterization showed a pulmonarycapillary wedge pressure of 15 with a diffusely diseased leftcoronary system , right coronary with serial stenoses of 50%proximal and 30% distal , and anterior apical hypokinesis withpreserved LV systolic function. An echocardiogram revealedanteroseptal akinesis at the apex without any mention of thrombus ,moderately dilated left ventricle with ejection fraction estimatedat 30%. It was felt at this time that the patient had sufferedmyocardial infarction at the time between her two Sadam Medical Center admissions. Her catheterization results suggested thatshe would be best managed medically and her hospital course thenwas notable for aggressive diuresis with Lasix and one time dose ofZaroxolyn , and rate control initially with Diltiazem with moderatesuccess and then by the 7th hospital day the addition of Lopressor.Patient diuresed well with loss of 2-3 kilograms and with decreasein her oxygen requirement was able to be weaned to room air withoxygen saturations 92-93%. By the time of her discharge , her O2saturation was 95% on room air and she was able to ambulate withoutassistance or complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.ID: On admission , patient's white blood cell count was noted to be16 and it was persistently high throughout the first four orfive days of her hospital course. She remained afebrile until the6th hospital day , when she was noted to have one temperature of101. Blood culture , urine culture , sputum , and chest x-ray did notreveal any evidence of infection and patient's white count wasnoted to fall to 9.8. No IV antibiotics were given.DIABETES; Patient was maintained on her normal dose of insulinand except for the day when she went to catheterization ,and covered with CZI sliding scale. Her blood sugars initially ranin the 200 to 300 range but by the end of admission she was morewell controlled between 100 and 200 , and did not require additionof CZI sliding scale. Of note , patient had described previousincidences of feeling diaphoretic and hungry in which she would eatpresumably secondary to hypoglycemia. After starting her betablocker , she continued to have these sensations of hypoglycemia andif so , it was though to be safe to continue with the beta blockertreatment.PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE; Patient has a history of femoralstenosis and had been suggested thatshe have a femoral angioplasty several years previously. Patientrefused that procedure at the time and has had no furthercomplications. During this admission a renal arteriogram wasperformed , which showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis with amild non-flow in the stenosis in the right renal artery. Renalcortex was smooth by arteriography.DISPOSITION: There were no complications. Patient was able toambulate and was stable on discharge. Her congestiveheart failure was largely resolved , and she was discharged to homewith follow-up to be with Dr. Carson Sequin in CARDSPAR MEDICAL CENTER Clinic.MEDICATIONS: Xanax 0.25 mg po q hs p.r.n.; Digoxin 0.25 mg po qday; Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.; enteric coatedaspirin one tablet po q day; Lasix 60 mg po q day; insulin 32 unitsNPH in the morning along with six units Regular insulin in themorning; Elavil 25 mg po q hs. She is to continue with herdiabetic diet with 2100 calories and to have low salt , lowcholesterol diet.Dictated By: POLLICA , DAN ROBAttending: JARRETT D.

Thepatient was transferred from Phlukester Hospital after developing theacute onset of substernal chest pain while driving his automobile.The patient was under no extraordinary circumstances ( e.g.emotional stress , exertional stress ) at the time he developed chestpain. Since the time of his five vessel CABG in 1987 , the patienthad experienced no intercurrent angina.The patient's coronary risk factors include a positive familyhistory and a previous diagnosis of hyperlipidemia. However thepatient does not have hypertension , diabetes and he is not atobacco smoker.As mentioned , the patient's chest pain was substernal and radiatedto the upper epigastrium. He experienced an element of burningwith exertion. Prior to this episode of recurrent chest pain , thepatient had had multiple exercise tolerance tests which were readas normal. He graded the chest pain at 8/10.The patient presented to G urgent care where his pain was notrelieved with four sublingual nitroglycerin. An EKG demonstratedlateral ST wave depressions. The patient was transferred toSkaggssin Hospital where IV TNG , morphine and Nifedipine were given.The patient's pain decreased to a level of 4/10. Despite thesemaneuvers , the patient's pain continued through the night and inthe morning. In the morning , he received additional morphine andIV Heparin was begun. Subsequently the patient became pain-free.The patient was transferred to Ck Health Of forfurther management.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hyperlipidemia. Bilateral anterior andlateral thigh achiness with exertiontimes six months ( workup in progress ).MEDICATIONS: On presentation to Menjack Hospital Medical Center ,Lovastatin 40 mg q q.m. , 20 mg q p.m. andenteric-coated aspirin one tablet q day.MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM A,XO COMMUNITY HOSPITAL IV nitroglycerin , IV heparin , Nifedipine SL , morphine aswell as aspirin and Lovastatin.The patient has no known drug allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's father developed angina secondaryto coronary artery disease at age 54 and diedat age 75 from an MI.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives at home withhis wife. He works as a professor atRieglemoinesro A Shing and restores buildings in his free time.HABITS: The patient denies tobacco use. He is anoccasional alcohol drinker.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , Mr. Latimer isa pleasant middle-aged man , mildlyanxious but in no acute distress. Vital signs on transfer:temperature 98.6 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 110/78 , respiratoryrate 22 with oxygen saturation of 99% on 4 liters of oxygen.HEENT: unremarkable. Neck: no jugular venous distention ( JVPless than 6 cm ) , carotids were 2+ bilaterally with no bruits ordelayed upstroke. Lungs: clear with good breath soundsbilaterally. Coronary: regular rate and rhythm with good heartsounds and a clear Sl and S2. There were no rubs , murmurs orgallops appreciated. There was no S3 or S4. The point of maximumimpulse was not displaced. The patient's spine was not tender andthere was no evidence of costovertebral angle tenderness. Abdomenhad good bowel sounds and was soft and nontender to palpation. Nomasses were palpated. Groin demonstrated decreased femoral pulsesbilaterally with a faint left femoral bruit. Rectal: normalrectal tone with an anodular prostate. Stool was soft , brown andguaiac negative. Extremities demonstrated no clubbing , cyanosis oredema. The patient's pulses at the dorsalis pedis and posteriortibialis were 2+ bilaterally. Neurologic examination was nonfocal.Electrolytes on presentation were within normal limits. His LFTswere notable for a slight increase in his LDH to 252. Thepatient's first CK on presentation was 2300 with a quantitative MBof 10.2 ng/ml. Cholesterol was 79. Albumin 2.8. Protime 12.4 ,INR 1.1. PTT 40.7 , consistent with heparin therapy. CBC wasnotable for a normal white count , hematocrit and platelet count.Urine had a specific gravity of 1.021 , pH 5 , negative dipstickevaluation.Chest x-ray demonstrated clear lung parenchyma and no bonyabnormalities. EKG on admission to Raldmance Mountbayshowed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 73 with normal intervalsand an axis of 0. The patient had Q waves in leads 3 and F andbiphasic T waves in leads V4 through V6. There was minimal changein these abnormalities with resolution of the patient's pain. Ofnote , EKGs taken at Townileahli Medical Center during the patient's initialadmission were notable for T wave depressions in leads V4 throughV6.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the CardiacIntensive Care Unit on IV heparin andnitroglycerine as well as continuation of his aspirin andLovastatin. The patient's pain was treated with morphine sulfate.His CKs were followed serially every 8 hours and achieved a peak CKof 2790 on 6/16/95 at 12 a.m. with an MB fraction of 188.8 ng/ml.Thereafter the patient's CKs rapidly declined. On 3/30/94 , thepatient's CK was 317 with an MB fraction of 3.5 ng/ml.After 24 hours pain-free in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit , thepatient was transferred to the Cardiac Step-Down floor. His IVnitroglycerin and IV heparin were discontinued and the patientremained pain-free. Echocardiogram performed on 6/16/95demonstrated inferior and posterior hypokinesis with an ejectionfraction of approximately 46%.On 3/9/95 , the patient underwent exercise tolerance testing with asubmax modified Bruce protocol. The patient exercised 9 minutesand was able to complete the study without dyspnea on exertion orchest pain. He achieved a maximum heart rate of 108 and amaximum blood pressure of 160/80. EKG was notable for unifocalPVCs and up to 2 mm ST depression in leads V2 through V4 whichpersisted up to 15 minutes into recovery. The patient was givenone sublingual nitroglycerin and these EKG changes resolved.The exercise tolerance test was interpreted as strongly positivefor ischemic coronary artery disease.On 1/9/95 , the patient underwent a submax MIBI to assess coronaryperfusion of the heart. Similarly , the exercise component of thisexamination demonstrated EKG changes consistent with ischemiccoronary flow. Nuclear imaging demonstrated a fixed apical lateraldefect in the patient's heart consistent with a healed or healingtransmural infarct. There was no evidence of ischemic reperfusiondefects.The results of these tests were discussed with the patient and hiswife in conjunction with the treating medical team of Dr. Settecase .The patient was offered the opportunity for coronarycatheterization to evaluate his anatomy , but he declined at thepresent time. It was decided that the patient would be maximallymedically managed and discharged to home with close followup underDr. Cockburn and Dr. Stenkamp . The patient's cardiac medications wereappropriately adjusted while an inpatient to achieve maximumcardiac benefit.On presentation , the patient also complained of progressiveanterior and lateral thigh pain. This pain was brought on byexertion and had increasingly limited his ability to walk over thelast six months whereas he had been able to walk four to five milesa day in recent months. He had been able to walk onlyapproximately one-quarter mile before developing pain in hisanterior thighs as well whereas he had been able to climb severalflights of stairs a few months ago. He now was able to walk onlyhalf a flight to a flight of stairs at a time before having torest. Six months ago , the patient had achieved a 25 pound weightloss but , by his report , because of his inability to exerciseeffectively , he had regained 15 pounds. The patient did notexperience this same anterior thigh pain while riding a bicycle orswimming. As an inpatient , Mr. Woollen underwent a non-invasivevascular study of the femoral and popliteal arteries. Thesedemonstrated no significant arterial occlusions as assessed bypressure manometry. The possibility of myositis or neuromuscularcompromise was entertained and these are to be followed up as anoutpatient.The patient also complained of symptoms consistent with an upperrespiratory viral infection which he had been experiencing over thepast two weeks. While an inpatient , he had a number of febrileepisodes , achieving a maximum temperature of 101.4. The patientwas treated symptomatically with Tylenol and started on Biaxin 500mg po bid. He received a five day course of oral Biaxin withresolution of his fever and decrease in his symptomatology.The patient never complained of shortness of breath , palpitations ,diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting or recurrent chest pain as aninpatient. However physical examination demonstrated rales 4 to 5cm above the bases bilaterally. The extremities remained free ofedema and the patient's jugular venous pressure never exceeded 6cm. A chest x-ray on 5/7/95 demonstrated evidence of earlycongestive heart failure. The patient was treated with daily dosesof IV Lasix with resolution of his rales. By the time ofdischarge , there was no evidence of continued heart failure and thepatient's Lasix was discontinued.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg po q day2. Cholestyramine one packet po q hs3. Lovastatin 20 mg po q hs4. Lopressor 50 mg po tid5. Sublingual nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets to be taken prnwith chest painDISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged to home withfollowup in MERH under Drs. Dwayne Ariel Bremme .The patient was instructed to call CMH Urgent Care if his chestpain recurs and does not resolve with sublingual nitroglycerin.Dictated By: ROLANDO YAFAI , M.D. LM45Attending: HOMER PRESTWICH , M.D. AP7  KL632/0039Batch: 659 Index No. SAEUZ50V37 D: 8/13/95T: 8/13/95

Apparently over the past week the patient has becomeprogressively more confused and lethargic. At baseline , she isalert and oriented and walks intermittently with walker ,although , at most time she is bedbound because of her obesity andan injured knee at the end of October .  Over the previous weekapparently , the patient had difficulty with her home oxygenmachine and she felt like she "was not getting any air".Apparently , her son had called the company that supplies theoxygen. They had come in and said that he should figure out howto fix it according to him , as she had not been getting oxygenfor the week prior to admission. She had not had any increase incough or sputum production. No fever or chills. No chest pain.No nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. She also had not any change inher baseline lower extremity swelling/deformity and no increasederythema or pain in her lower extremities. She has not had anyrecent long trips , although she had been somewhat bed bound afterthis knee injury. On the day of admission , the patient hadincreasing shortness of breath , fatigue , and somnolence andapparently hallucinations. The Emergency Medical Service wascalled and she was unarousable at home and they found her oxygensats to be 40%. By the time she in to the ER she was lethargicand moaning incoherently. Her vitals at that time weretemperature of 97.6 Fahrenheit , blood pressure of 178/46 mmHg ,heart rate of 106 and regular , breathing 36 times a minute andsatting 90% on 100% nonrebreather. Her fingerstick at that timewas 220. Her trachea was intubated and she was given Fentanyl ,Valium , albuterol , and Atrovent nebs and Solu-Medrol in theemergency room.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Significant for hypertension , severe left ventricularhypertrophy , asthma/COPD without known pulmonary function testingin the past , morbid obesity weighing approximately 460 pounds ,obstructive sleep apnea - she could not tolerate CPAP in thepast , osteoarthritis , and type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as adistant history of pulmonary embolus. After having a totalabdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in4/3 , she was anticoagulated for several months , but not sincethen.ALLERGIES:No known drug allergies.HOME MEDICATIONS:Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth each day , furosemide 40 mg by moutheach day , glyburide 5 mg by mouth each day , albuterol inhalers ,Motrin 600 mg by mouth each day , and metoprolol 25 mg by mouth 3times a day , and she is also on 3L nasal cannula home oxygen 24hours a day.SOCIAL HISTORY:She is a former bus driver. She lives at home with her son ,Troisi who is 30 years old , has a visiting nurse. No tobacco oralcohol or illicit drugs.FAMILY HISTORY:Noncontributory.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:Her temperature was 97.6 degree Fahrenheit , her heart rate was106 and regular , her blood pressure was 130/50 , respiratory rateof 24 , and oxygen saturation 98%. At that point , she wasintubated. She opened her eyes to sternal rub but not to voice.Her pupils were equal and 2 mm bilaterally. Her neck was supple.Pulmonary: Sounds were coarse anterior and laterally.Cardiovascular: She had distant , distant heart sounds ,tachycardic. Her jugular venous pressure was unable to beassessed given her neck size and her distal , radial , and dorsalispedis pulses were all palpable 1+. Abdomen is obese. Bowelsounds were present , soft , nontender , and nondistended. She hada midline scar. Extremities were cool with chronic venostasischanges perhaps lymphedema changes bilaterally. Left lowerextremity was 23 inches and right lower extremity was 18 inchesat the calf. Neurologic: As stated , she opens her eyes tosternal rub at that time.LABS ON ADMISSION:She had a sodium of 144 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 95 , bicarbonateof 40 , BUN of 16 , creatinine of 0.7 , and glucose of 236. Calciumof 8.9 , magnesium of 1.9 , phosphorous of 4.7 , ALT of 23 , AST of18 , total bilirubin of 2.1 , alkaline phosphatase of 78 , andalbumin of 3.9. Urinalysis was significant for 3+ protein , 2+blood , positive leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , andbacteria as well as trichomonas. Her D-dimer was 1330. Herwhite count was 13 , 000 with 90% neutrophils , 2% bands , and 5%lymphocytes. Her hematocrit was 42.4% and platelet count was164 , 000. Her MCV was 93 and she had an anti-PF4 antibody , alsoknown as a HIT antibody , which was negative. Her INR was 1.2 andher PTT was 26.3. Her urine and serum tox screens did not revealany toxins. Her chest radiograph was a poor quality film giventhe girth. The film was rotated. The ET tube was 3.5 cm fromthe corner , otherwise , extraordinarily limited , but no grossconsolidation or effusions were noted. A pulmonary embolus CTscan or V/Q scan were considered to rule out a pulmonary embolus;however , the patient's abdominal girth prevented either of thesestudies from being done. Lower extremity noninvasive studieswere performed , which did not show any clot although this wasalso limited by her chronic lower extremity changes. Urineculture and blood cultures were sent on 10/28/06 .  The urineculture grew mixed flora and the blood cultures have beennegative to date.ASSESSMENT AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:This is a 54-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease on home oxygen as well as obstructive sleep apnea ,hypertension , and left ventricular hypertrophy and obesity withmental status changes and respiratory changes consistent with anexacerbation of recurrent obstructive pulmonary disease andhypoxemia.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Pulmonary: Her trachea was extubated within several hours ofcoming to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. At first , she wasdoing quite well on BiPAP at 25 and 5; however , she became a bitmore somnolent and the decision was made to intubate her tracheaonce again within several hours. An ABG at that time was done ,which revealed an arterial blood gas at that time with an FiO2 of60% revealed a pH of 7.19 , a CO2 of 119 , and an oxygen of 106with saturation of 97%. As we were preparing to intubate thetrachea , the patient became more alert and requested to speak toher son beforehand and saying she did not want to have the tubedown her throat. Her son came in and she continued making moresense and asking us not to intubate her trachea. The decisionwas made to observe her with the BiPAP , which was done. Withinseveral hours her carbon dioxide had decreased to 103 and then by3 hours after that it actually decreased to 80. Her arterialblood gas at that time showed pH of 7.32 with a PCO2 of 80 , a PO2of 71 on 2L of actual nasal cannula and then O2 saturation of95%. She remained on BiPAP intermittently at various setting.Her final settings were pressure support of 20 and a PEEP of 5.Her CO2 ranged from the mid 60s to 99 without a very clearcorrelation between her mental status and her CO2s. The thoughtwas that her baseline CO2 was probably somewhere in the 70s giventhat her pH was normal with PCO2 around in the low 80s. It wasthought that she is a chronic carbon dioxide retainer. Herbicarbonates on admission here previously had been in the mid tohigh 30s and low 40s just as they were during this admission andthat she just had an acute hypercarbic event. Throughout herstay she has had episodes where she become slightly lessresponsive always will awake with appropriate physical stimuliand will give appropriate responses. She was treated for herpulmonary disease initially with corticosteroids , which werediscontinued given that we did not feel that she had large ainflammatory component to this , Levofloxacin 500 mg a day ,albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and she was started on aninhaled corticosteroid.2. Vascular: The possibility of a pulmonary embolus wasconsidered especially given her history of pulmonary embolus inthe past. Unfortunately , diagnostic imaging was inadequate givenher girth and lower extremity issues. There is discussion ofputting her on chronic anticoagulation for the possibility ofpulmonary embolus; however , we felt she had a low to moderateprobability of pulmonary embolus and that the risks of long-termanticoagulation outweigh the benefits given that she probably didnot have a pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis. This wasdiscussed with the patient and she agreed with that decision.This can be readdressed in the future. The decision was alsocentered around the fact that her previous pulmonary embolus wasin the setting of pelvic surgery and likely did not reflex anyincreased likelihood of thrombosis. However , she should becontinued on subcutaneous enoxaparin or other prophylaxis fordeep venous thrombosis while she is bedbound.3. Cardiac: The patient has a history of hypertension and leftventricular hypertrophy. She should be continued onenteric-coated aspirin 81 mg a day , lisinopril 40 mg a day , andshe will discharged on atenolol 25 mg per day.4. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus. She wasmanaged in the hospital on a low dose of insulin NPH and Aspartsliding scale. On discharge , she will be resumed on her homedose of sulfonylurea. It may be considered that she will be goodcandidate for metformin given her weight and likely poor controlof her diabetes.5. Obstructive sleep apnea with known elevated pulmonary arterysystolic pressure at approximately 90+ right atrium andechocardiogram during her last admission at Mertaymonpeters Medical Center .  The patient should be counseled and encouraged to useher BiPAP or CPAP machine at home all the time at night given herlikely severe obstructive sleep apnea and known vascular effectsof that.MEDICATION ON DISCHARGE:1. Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth each day.2. Atenolol 25 mg by mouth each day.3. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg by mouth each day.4. Enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous each day.5. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers every 4 hours and p.r.n.wheezing or shortness of breath , this may be changed to inhalerswhen the patient can tolerate and she should be educated on that.6. Flovent.7. Levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth each day for 5 more days.8. Flagyl 500 mg by mouth twice a day for 11 more days fortreatment of trichomonas.9. Glyburide 5 mg by mouth once daily.10. Regular insulin sliding scale as determined by the doctor atrehabilitation with meals.11. BiPAP 20 for pressure support and 5 of PEEP every night all ,night and during the day as required. It would be recommendedthat she was on BiPAP continuously for at least 48 hours afterdischarge as tolerated by the patient except to speak with herfamily.eScription document: 4-2420264 EMSSten TelDictated By: MONSERRATE , KIRBYAttending: SIGNORILE , BROCKDictation ID 6980535D: 11/8/06T: 11/8/06

Coronary artery disease.2. Diabetes mellitus.3. Hypertension.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old womanwith coronary artery disease andcardiomyopathy admitted with clinical shortness of breath. Thepatient has a long history of coronary artery disease with mostrecent echocardiogram in 8/06 showing dilated left ventricle ,ejection fraction of 30% to 35% , inferior posterior thinning andakinesis and severe hypokinesis of the distal septum to apex.There was remaining wall of hypokinesis. There was also traceaortic insufficiency and hypertrophied right ventricle. The mostrecent catheterization was 11/4/99 showing a left main with 30%distal stenosis , occluded left anterior descending , right coronaryartery with 40% proximal and mid 70% stenoses. The grafts werewithout significant disease. The left heart catheterization showedleft ventricle pressures of 220/80. Left ventriculography revealedan ejection fraction of 50% to 55% with trace mitral regurgitation.( Please refer to past medical history for further details of thepatient's cardiac history ). The patient now reports malaise forone week with increasing dyspnea on exertion. She also reportsfever to 101 two days ago with cough productive of white sputum.She reports that she went to Urgent Care and received Bactrim. Shealso had received Bactrim 48 hours ago. She also complains ofincreased orthopnea , baseline two-pillow orthopnea and nowfive-pillow orthopnea and nighttime cough. She denies dietaryindiscretion or medical noncompliance and reports that herperipheral edema is stable. She denies dysuria or frequency andalso believes that her weight has increased although notes on chartindicate that her baseline is 220 to 228 pounds.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiac riskfactors were age and hypertension. Diabetesmellitus , nonproliferative anemia , one non-Q wave myocardialinfarction in 1981 , coronary artery bypass grafting in 1995 atBarreman A Health with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending graft , saphenous vein graft to posteriordescending artery graft , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginalgraft. Several admissions for congestive heart failure includingone in 1996 which included an echocardiogram with ejection fractionof 40%. Decreased from earlier 59% with inferior posteriorhypokinesis. Congestive heart failure admission in 2/11 with anechocardiogram that showed ejection fraction of 30% to 35% ,decreased from previous echocardiogram. Non-Q wave myocardialinfarction in 8/06 at I Imin Medical Center with troponin of6. Baseline left bundle branch block. Insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus. Status post right carotid endarterectomy.Hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , status post appendectomy ,status post right mastoidectomy ( secondary to recurrent otitis ).History of recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Amaurosis fugaxin left eye. The patient was treated with Coumadin after 2/14admission. Head CT showed no sign of infarct. Echocardiogram wasnegative for PFO. Ejection fraction at the time was 60%.Loculated pleural effusion in 4/9 with apparent decortication andlysis. Nephrolithiasis but none times greater than two years.Bell's palsy resolved.ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes hives. Ceclor causes a rash.MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , EC-ASA 81 mg p.o. q.d. ,Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. q.d. ,Cozaar 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zestril 20mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Hytrin 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 50 q.a.m. , 8 q.p.m. subcutaneously ,Slow-K eight once a day.SOCIAL HISTORY: Retired housewife , married , rare alcohol use , notobacco use.FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for mother with myocardial infarction atage 40 and a father with myocardial infarction atage 40.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 98.1 , pulse 59 ,blood pressure 180/82 , respirations 22 , and96% on room air. Weight 226 pounds. General: Large woman lyingin bed in no acute distress. HEENT: Jugulovenous pressure greaterthan 12 cm , oropharynx clear , no thyromegaly. Chest: Bibasilarcrackles and diffuse wheezes and rhonchi , no E to A changes.Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. There was a II/VIsystolic murmur loudest at bases , question S4 , S1 and S2. Abdomen:Soft , protuberant , nontender , benign. Extremities: Bilateraledema to knees , minimally pitting. Neurologic: Cranial nerves andstrength intact.LABORATORY/X-RAY STUDIES: Notable for BUN of 55 ( baseline high 20sin 8/06 ) , creatinine of 1.7 , baselineof 1.0 to 1.2. Hematocrit of 35.5 with MCV of 80.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with presumptivediagnosis of recent tracheal bronchitiscomplicated by overlying congestive heart failure. She was treatedwith doxycycline and never spiked a fever in-house. Her cough wasessentially nonproductive and thus sputum was not sent. She wasdiuresed progressively and responded well symptomatically to thisdiuresis. Her pulmonary examination improved. The patient'sexamination was complicated by some asymptomatic bradycardia intothe 40s , particularly at night while lying down. On admission , herDigoxin level was low at 0.5. An attempt to increase her betablocker appeared to exacerbate this bradycardia and thus she wasdischarged on the same dose that she was admitted with , i.e. ,Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. Notably , even when these medicationswere held , her pulse was often in the high 40s or low 50s withoutsymptoms and remained less than 60 even while walking some of thetime. Her thyroid stimulating hormone was measured and was normalat 3.13. The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine were thoughtsecondary to her congestive heart failure and in fact , hercreatinine decreased with diuresis. Recent iron studies in 2/30were suggestive of anemia of chronic disease and her hematocrit of35 on review was towards the low end of normal range during thepast year.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stablecondition. Discharge medications were EC-ASA 325 mgp.o. q.d. , clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q.d. , doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. times five days , NPH insulin 8units q.a.m. , start 50 units q.a.m. and 8 units q.p.m. , Zestril 20mg p.o. b.i.d. , Hytrin 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.p.m. ,Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. , Demadex 100 mg p.o. q.d. , Cozaar 50 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. Shewill follow up with Dr. Estrade in one week in his clinic.V.N.A. will check the patient's weight , pulse and blood pressure athome.

The last one was of no help whatsoever. Her x-rays onreview shows that she has degenerative spondylolisthesis at L4-L5.Her CT scan and MRI scan both demonstrate the presence of a slip atL4-L5. There is rather marked L4 neural foraminal narrowingbilaterally , with only some narrowing of the lateral recesses ofthe canal. The distribution of her pain sounds most likely to beof L4 nerve root.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for insulin dependent diabetesmellitus with retinopathy , atypical anxietydisorder , aortic stenosis with history of rheumatic fever , andglaucoma in the left eye , and congenital nystagmus , and amblyopia.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left knee arthrotomy; right ankle openreduction , internal fixation; right carpaltunnel , and cervical laminectomy.ALLERGIES: Elavil , Zomax and Naprosyn.MEDICATIONS: Insulin , NPH , 8 units subcu q. day; Prozac 10 mgp.o. q. day , and Timolol .5% , one GTT O.S. b.i.d.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is slightly obese , and standswith a normal alignment.

Upon discussion w/team CT/CTA were deferred given pt's renal insufficiency and risk ofcontrast nephropathy coupled with our feeling that any findings wouldnot change pt management. This will be discussed with pt's PCP , Dr.Benedict Wichern .3. ENDO: pt was continued on home insulin regimen with coverage withinsulin sliding scale. Pt was found have a TSH of 158 FT4 1.8 , FT3 56.Upon discussion w/ pt , she revealed that she had previously beendiagnosed and begun on replacement but did not know what it was for andsubsequently stopped it on her own. Pt started on synthroid to be f/uw/endocrine. This may be the etiology of her symptoms.4. Prophylaxis: Nexium; pt was already anticoagulated with ASA , plavixand Coumadin.5.

She has a been closely followed since approximately 1990for multi-valve disease. In early February of 1998 she presentedwith chest pressure and was seen at Ga Medical Center forcardiac catheterization which revealed no significant coronaryartery disease but markedly increased filling pressures. Her rightatrial pressure was 14/16/10. Right ventricular pressure was75/100 , pulmonary artery pressure was 75/35/50 and her pulmonarycapillary wedge pressure was 32/36/30. Echocardiogram on 3/16/98 ,revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mildly decreasedsystolic function with an ejection fraction of 45 percent , normalright ventricular size and function , moderate mitral stenosis andthree plus mitral regurgitation , moderate aortic insufficiency andaortic stenosis , three plus tricuspid regurgitation and a dilatedinferior vena cava.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for rheumatic fever ,hypothyroidism , borderline diabetesmellitus , atrial fibrillation , breast cancer for which she hadradiation therapy.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for a right lumpectomy in the1990s. She has had an appendectomy in 1993and a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in the past.ALLERGIES: Penicillin ( causes rash and itch ).PHYSICAL EXAM: Unremarkable.HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Copes was brought to the operating room on4/6/98 where she underwent an aortic valvereplacement with a #19 St. Jude valve , a mitral valve replacementwith a #27 St. Jude valve and a tricuspid valvuloplasty with aDeVega annuloplasty. The patient intraoperatively was found tohave a tricuspid valve with a dilated annulus but normal leaflets.Transient right ventricular dysfunction requiring epinephrine andnitroglycerin. The patient came off of bypass and was paced. Thepatient went back into atrial fibrillation. The patient wasbrought up to the intensive care unit in stable condition. Ms.Kelty was extubated on postoperative day number one. She was notedto have bradycardia postoperatively which required pacing and shewas found to have no significant underlying rhythm. She was seenby the electrophysiology service who had suggested we continuefollowing her and hope to find a recurrence of her AV nodefunction.

Healso has a history of hypothyroidism and hypocalcemia status posttotal thyroidectomy for premalignant lesion. The patientpresented to an outside hospital on 10/2/05 with chest painradiating down his left arm. His EKG showed STD depressions ,troponin was 6.2 , creatinine was 1.4. The patient wastransferred to Cas Medical Center where a cardiaccatheterization done on 10/4/05 revealed 80% proximal LADlesion , 75% proximal circumflex lesion , 100% mid RCA lesion andan ejection fraction of 40%.HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted , made ready for surgery , takento the operating room on 2/7/05 at which time he underwent aCABG x4 with a LIMA to the LAD and a Y sequential graft thatconnects the saphenous vein graft to the aorta to the RCA andthen a sequential left radial artery graft that connectssaphenous vein graft to OM2 and then OM3. Intraoperatively , acalcified distal ascending and aortic arch found. There was asoft spot to cannulae. The patient was cooled to 22 degrees andthe distal RCA to the saphenous vein graft anastomosis was sewnunder fibrillatory arrest. Proximal to the aorta was done undercirculatory arrest. Proximal radial anastomosis was placed onthe proximal part of the saphenous vein graft to the RCA.Immediate postoperative course was uncomplicated. He wastransferred to the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #1.He was neurologically intact , but been pulling at lines andcatheters stating he wanted them out and trying to climb out ofbed , so he was placed on a 1:1 sitter. Nitroglycerin was weaned.He was started back on Lopressor and captopril for hypertension.He had an NG tube placed for gastric dilatation. He wasextubated overnight on postoperative day #1.On postoperative day #2 , he again was hypertensive. Captoprilwas added , increased Lopressor and the diltiazem. He self DC'dhis Foley as well as IV on postoperative day #2 , stating he wasgoing to leave the hospital. On postoperative day #3 , Psych wasconsulted. They felt that imaging was warranted , however , hisbehavior improved overnight. He was transferred to the Step-DownUnit on postoperative day #3. He was in sinus rhythm. His NGtube had been removed. His diet was being advanced as tolerated.He was auto diuresing. He was back on his hypothyroid meds. Onpostoperative day #4 , he was doing well. He was mobilizing ,diuresing.

At age three , the patient was diagnosed with Wilms'tumor on the left , which was resected and subsequently treated withwide field radiation. The patient , thereafter developedradiation-induced tyroid cancer , at which time he underwentsubtotal thyroidectomy. In addition , the patient developedradiation nephritis in his remaining right kidney and pulmonaryfibrosis. In April of 1997 , the patient underwent living relateddonor renal transplantation for chronic renal failure. The patientwas at that point CMV antigen negative , however , the donor kidneywas CMV antigen positive. The patient underwent an uncomplicatedtransplantation , however , the postoperative course was complicatedby cytomegalovirus infection , presenting with diarrhea andrequiring hospitalization in February 1997. The patient was treatedwith ganciclovir and subsequently maintained on Cytovene. Thepatient remained healthy until August 1997 , at which time he wasagain admitted for a recrudescence of his cytomegalovirusinfection. In August 1997 , the patient presented with athree-day history of fever to approximately 105 , anorexia , drycough , fatigue , headache , dizziness , sweats , nausea and dyspnea onexertion. The patient was , at that point , treated withganciclovir , however his fevers persisted and he was dischargedafter five days of therapy. At that time , the patient's CMVantigen test was negative , however , his shell vial cultures , bothreturned as positive. The patient was maintained on ganciclovirtherapy in the post hospital course until April , 1997 , atwhich time his peripherally inserted catheter was removed.Subsequently , the patient has been healthy for approximately fourweeks , then on June , 1998 , he noted a groin lump on theright. From June , 1998 , he noted feelingworse with fevers and chills , and a productive cough beginning onSeptember , 1998. The patient's groin lump , subsequently , becamepainful , and he passed several loose bowel movements.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Wilms' tumor , ( 2 ) status post leftnephrectomy with wide field radiationtherapy , ( 3 ) NCH renal disease status post living related donorrenal transplant from father in April 1997 , ( 4 ) hypertension , ( 5 )insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , ( 6 ) pulmonary hypertension ,( 7 ) hyperthyroid , ( 8 ) hyperparathyroid , ( 9 ) hypertriglyceridemia ,( 10 ) gout , ( 11 ) CMV infection in February 1997 and August 1997 ,( 12 ) history of perirectal abscess , ( 13 ) history of atrialfibrillation spontaneously converted in October 1998.ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Synthroid 150 mcg q.d. , NPH insulin 14units q.a.m. , regular insulin p.r.n. ,nadolol 80 mg q.d. , Prednisone 10 mg q.d. , Neoral 100 mg b.i.d. ,CellCept 1 g b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. p.r.n. ,Coumadin 4 mg q.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives at home with his wife and hasfour children. He denies alcohol or tobacco use.FAMILY HISTORY: No coronary artery disease. No history of cancer.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , but ill-appearingman in some respiratory distress , lying inbed. Temperature is 103 , heart rate 70 , blood pressure 160/80 ,respirations 26 , oxygen saturation 90% on 4 L oxygen. HEENTexamination was notable for cushingoid facies and flushing wasevident. No lymphadenopathy. The neck was supple , mucousmembranes moist and sclera were anicteric. Chest examinationrevealed crackles on the right to half way up. Heart examinationrevealed a noisy precordium with a prominent T2 and a 2/6 systolicejection murmur. Abdominal examination was negative. Extremityexamination revealed some slight swelling of the lower extremities.Cutaneous examination was notable for evidence of thin subcutaneoustissues and development of a buffalo hump.LABORATORY DATA: White count of 11.3 with 46 polys , 36lymphocytes and 7 bands , hematocrit was 32.4 andplatelets were 143 , 000. Coagulation studies revealed a prothrombintime of 15.8 and an INR of 1.8. Electrolytes were within normallimits , blood urea nitrogen was 39 , creatinine was 2.5 , glucose was85 , calcium 10.2. Liver function tests revealed an alkalinephosphatase of 342 , total protein was 7.9 with an albumin of 3.9.Cholesterol was 194 , triglycerides were 249. Cyclosporine levelwas 303.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Surgery was consulted and the right groinabscess was drained and a wick was inserted. This wound wasdressed and continued care was preformed by nursing staff. Bloodcultures on admission revealed no growth and on hospital day tworevealed no growth. Wound cultures revealed few coagulase ,negative staph. Antibiotics were initiated , first vancomycin ,gentamicin and Flagyl were initiated , however gentamycin wassubsequently discontinued and ceftazidime was initiated. Thepatient had one fever spike on hospital day one to 101.9. Thepatient subsequently had no fever spikes , however , on hospital daythree Levaquin was initiated and intravenous antibiotics werecontinued until hospital day four. At that point , the patient hadbeen afebrile for 48 hours and the decision was made to switch thepatient to oral antibiotics , including Levaquin and Augmentin. Thepatient continued to defervesce , his breathing improved , the painin his right groin improved , dressing changes were continued andthe patient remained afebrile for more than 24 hours afterinitiating oral antibiotics.2. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient has a history of hypertension andhas been maintained on nadolol , recently requiring a doubling inhis dose from 40 mg q.d. to 80 mg q.d. He was admitted and placedon 80 mg q.d. of nadolol , however , his blood pressures continued torun up to 170 systolic and up to 110 diastolic. At that time , thedecision was made to initiate a second antihypertensive medicationand nifedipine XL was chosen. He was maintained for two days at 30mg on this medication and his blood pressures subsequentlystabilized at 130/80. The patient also carries a diagnosis ofpulmonary hypertension , presumed from the February 1997 , resultsof his echocardiogram. These results revealed a pressure gradientin the pulmonary arterial system , and on this admission asubsequent echocardiogram was obtained to assess left ventricularfunction and his pulmonary vascular status. The results of thisstudy revealed 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and 1+ mitralregurgitation , unchanged from prior studies and a pulmonaryarterial pressure of approximately 45 mmHg , also not notablychanged.3. PULMONARY: On admission , the patient reported a productivecough , in addition to difficulty breathing. This was evaluatedwith a chest radiogram , which revealed possibility of a right sidedpulmonary process , corroborated on examination by evidence ofcrackles half way up. The decision was made to rule the patientout for another flare of his CMV infection. Studies for CMVantigen and CMV from the buffy coat were sent and the final resultsrevealed a positive CMV antigen , but a negative buffy coat. Thepatient's pulmonary status improved on oxygen and on intravenousantibiotics. A induced sputum sample was obtained and studies weresent for atypical organisms including CPT , fungi , in addition tobacteria. All these studies were negative. In addition ,Legionella antigen was also negative. Prior to discharge , thepatient's pulmonary status had returned to baseline and hadentirely resolved.4. GASTROINTESTINAL: On admission , the patient reported multipleloose bowel movements. However , in his hospital course this didnot continue to be an issue. The patient also regained hisappetite during the hospital course.5. HEMATOLOGIC: The patient was continued on his anticoagulationfor history of atrial fibrillation at 4 mg daily with an INRremaining in his goal parameters , which were set at 1.6-2.0. Thepatient however , has recently spontaneously converted to sinusrhythm and throughout his hospital course remained in sinus rhythmwith continuous monitoring.6. RENAL: On admission , the patient's creatinine level was 2.5and remained stable throughout his hospital course. Hiscyclosporine level was 303 on admission , on hospital day four , alevel of 700 was obtained , however , this determined from a historythat this level had been drawn shortly after the patient had takenthe cyclosporine. During his hospital course , vancomycin levelswere followed. These levels reached a maximum of 19.8 on hospitalday four , at which time intravenous antibiotics were discontinued.7. ENDOCRINE. The patient carries a history of multiple endocrineissues including hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism , diabetesmellitus , hyperthyroidism on thyroid replacement therapy followingsubtotal thyroidectomy , and possibility of mineral corticoiddeficiency. The Endocrine Team was consulted. Thyroid studies andparathyroid studies were sent and revealed a TSH of 0.02 , a T4 of6.0 , a THPR of 1.47. On discharge , the patient's parathyroid 1 , 25vitamin D and 25 vitamin D were still pending. The Endocrine Teamrecommended decreasing his Synthroid dose to a level of 125 mcgdaily. In addition , they recommended a bone densitometry study forevaluation of his bone mass following chronic maintenance on thesteroid therapy and a history of hyperparathyroidism. The teamthought that the patient's previous question of a mineral corticoiddeficiency was likely due to his prior Cozaar therapy. They didnot fell it was necessary at this point to preform a cortizonestimulation study or to further assess this possibility of amineral corticoid deficiency.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Augmentin 250/125 mg t.i.d. , Levaquin 250mg q.d. , CellCept 500 mg b.i.d. , Neoral 100mg b.i.d. , Prednisone 10 mg q.d. , Synthroid 125 mcg q.d. , INPinsulin 14 units subcu q.a.m. , regular insulin subcu p.r.n. , Axid150 mg q.d. , nadolol 80 mg q.d. , nifedipine XL 30 mg q.d. , Coumadin4 mg q.d. , iron sulfate 300 mg q.d.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.DISPOSITION: To home.FOLLOW-UP: 1.

Two days prior to admission , thepatient had developed the abrupt onset of palpitation , chestpain , diaphoresis , anxiety , and shortness of breath. She tookher blood pressure and this was found to be greater than 200 withthe rapid pulse. She called her PCP and was instructed to call911. She was taken to the Ha Hstibrook Medical Center ED. Ofnote , she had not taken her Toprol-XL for the prior three days.In the emergency department , the systolic blood pressure was inthe 180s. This was controlled with her home medications and IVLopressor. The patient was ruled out for an MI in ED/OBS. Shewent for a MIBI on the morning of admission , but this wascanceled because the patient was dizzy. Of note , the patient hashad an identical admission several months earlier for a labileblood pressure. During that admission , the patient's hydralazineand beta-blocker was titrated up with improved blood pressurecontrol. She was ruled out for pheochromocytoma and renalartery stenosis. She did have elevated plasma metanephrinesduring that admission. She was discharged at that point on animproved antihypertensive regimen as described above. She alsoreports having had a similar episode two weeks ago.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Hypertension , angina , osteoarthritis , GERD , diverticulosis ,hyperlipidemia , coronary artery disease status post CABG x4 andmultiple stents , chronic dizziness , stable cath 8/4 .HOME MEDICATIONS:1.

She lives in West O Uxkan by herself , has ahelper ( visiting aid ). No family nearby. Her family lives inPit Forda StaFAMILY HISTORY:Her brother died at 61 years old of CVA. Her mother died at 75years old with CVA. Her sister had an MI at age 80.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:Vital signs: Heart rate 98 , blood pressure 172/70 with a rangeof 103-172/40-70. O2 saturation was 97% on room air. Her examwas significant for tachycardia with a regular rate , normal S1and S2 , and soft systolic ejection murmur at the right uppersternal border. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable.LABS ON ADMISSION:CBC was within normal limits. Chem-7 was significant for BUN of22 and creatinine of 103. Calcium was 10.5 , phosphorus was 2.5 ,and albumin was 4.3. LFTs were normal. Her D-dimer was 1305.She had two sets of negative cardiac enzymes. Coags were normal.EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 75 beats per minute ,left axis deviation , LVH , left atrial enlargement. T-waveflatting in lead III only.STUDIES:1. Chest x-ray ( 9/29/05 ): No acute cardiopulmonary process.2. PE CT ( 11/9/05 ): No PE.3. Head CT ( 11/9/05 ): Left-sided meningiomas , unchanged from2004.4. MIBI ( 10/27/05 ): Area of reversible ischemia , unchanged from2002.CONSULTS:Cardiology ( FMCO ): Luke Ollie Buckley .HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:1. Paroxysmal hypertension/tachycardia: This was in the settingof not taking her Toprol. She does have a history of labileblood pressure and difficult to control hypertension. Thissymptom was thought to look very much like pheochromocytoma , butthis was ruled out last admission. Renal artery stenosis wasalso ruled out last admission. Given the description and thefact that she had elevated plasma metanephrines on the previousadmission , one possible diagnosis that was considered with pseudopheochromocytoma. Studies for pheochromocytoma , pseudopheochromocytoma , carcinoid , and hypothyroidism ( including24-hour urine metanephrines were sent ) these all returned asnegative. Her TSH was normal. She was initially put on q.i.d.Lopressor and hydralazine. The hydralazine was then discontinueddue to hypotension. Her Lopressor was changed to Toprol-XL , thiswas also discontinued for hypotension. Her ultimate regimen wastitrated based on her blood pressures and eventually she was puton Avapro 75 mg daily , atenolol 25 mg daily , and her home dose ofImdur 120 mg daily. Her target blood pressures were 140s to 150sand with this regimen , she was well controlled and asymptomaticupon discharge.2. Ischemia: She was initially ruled out for MI. Her MIBIshowed reversible ischemia unchanged from 2002 despite twocatheterizations in intervening time. She was seen by LMHCardiology , and this defect was felt to be nonintervenable. Shewas discharged home in stable condition and chest pain free.3. Dizziness/nausea: She had episodes of this during herhospitalization. It was of unclear etiology and she has had aprevious significant prior workup ( see previous dischargesummary ). She received p.r.n. meclizine and Compazine and wasdischarged home without any dizziness or nausea.4. Calcium: She had borderline high calcium and a PTH was sentand returned mildly elevated. This will need to be followed upas an outpatient.DISCHARGE CONDITION:Stable.TO DO PLAN:Further workup for question of elevated PTH in the setting ofhigh calcium suggestive of hyperparathyroidism.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.

TPN was d/c'ed on the day ofdischarge.ACTIVITY: He may walk as tolerated.ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Incarcerated chronic ventral hernia statuspost sigmoid colectomy , colostomy , and Hartmann's operation.The patient is to follow up with Dr. Galla in two weeks andDr. Caracciolo who is the attending in two weeks. He should also follow up with Dr.Smutzler , cardiology in 2 months , and Dr. Parramore , GI in 2-4 weeks.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 72-year-old male admitted for anincarcerated chronic ventral hernia , postoperative day 6 , statuspost sigmoid colectomy , colostomy , and Hartmann's operation.Hospital course was complicated by postoperative acuterespiratory failure , respiratory acidosis with metabolicacidosis , pleural effusion , hypokalemia , myocardial infarction ,thrombocytopenia , and delirium. He has a known history of penilecancer status post penectomy complicated by perinealurethrocutaneous fistula , chronic anemia requiring transfusions ,non-insulin-dependant diabetes , hypertension ,hypercholesterolemia , obesity , and recurrent UTIs. The patienthad a suprapubic catheter placed by Urology. His postoperativecourse otherwise was alright. He started having atrialfibrillation on 7/28/07 , initially remained stable with normalblood pressures. He was transferred to the floor on 7/28/07 ,wherein he developed rapid ventricular response to 120. On6/6/07 , he began hypotensive with systolics of 70. Cardiologywas consulted. He was initially treated with Lopressor anddiltiazem drip. He remained hypotensive despite IV boluses. Hewas switched to amiodarone mode and drip , but again he becamehypotensive. Therefore he was transferred to the unit and givena digoxin load and was transferred for a possibleelectrocardioversion. He remained asymptomatic throughout theday with low blood pressures. In the ICU , he was again startedand maintained on amiodarone IV. He tolerated it without aproblem. He did have an episode of bright red blood from his NGtube in the ICU and GI was consulted. They felt given that hishematocrits have stabilized after two units of packed cells , hedid not need to be urgently scoped. He was started on Pepcid IVand a Nexium drip , and had hematocrit measured q.6 h. , whichremains normal. He was transferred back to the floor on thesemedications and was started on TPN after a PICC line was placedand continued to do well. He was scoped by GI on 3/24/07 , whichshowed diffuse gastritis thought to be due to the NG tube , andtwo ulcers turned out bleeding. Postprocedure , he was started onCarafate and was transferred to Nexium p.o. after he was taking adiet. Again , his PICC line was safe on 4/15/07 and he wasstarted on TPN on 9/25/07 .  The NG tube was removed on 3/24/07and his diet has been slowly advanced. He is being discharged onTPN as his total caloric needs are still not being met by p.o.nutrition and he is in good condition on discharge.He was not anti-coagulated for his Atrial Fibrillation due to his risk of GIbleeding , as decided by GI.eScription document: 0-8655717 CSSten TelDictated By: VOCK , RODOLFOAttending: REGINALDO , EARLE CHANCEDictation ID 2930893D: 4/2/07T: 4/2/07

He has also experienced worsening peripheralvascular disease. In this context , he was admitted to Mounten Memorial approximately one month ago , when on May , heunderwent debridement of diabetic foot ulcers and amputation of theright fifth toe. On October , he also underwent a rightfemoropopliteal bypass graft. He was discharged from Penzale Bill Clinic on February , 1997 to home , followed by VNA fordressing changes. He did well postoperatively; however , he beganexperiencing increasing pain in both legs over the two days priorto admission. He treated this with Tylenol. He states thisglucose levels have been doing well , although he is not able tocite any numbers.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Hypertension. 2 ) Peripheral vasculardisease. 3 ) Type II diabetes mellitus. 4 )Elevated cholesterol.MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission included Vasotec 5milligrams q.d.; Glyburide 5 milligrams q.d.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: Tobacco: two packs per day times 40 years ,presently an active smoker. Alcohol: deniesalcohol intake in the last six weeks; history of previous heavyalcohol use. The patient is divorced. He currently lives with hisgirlfriend. He is currently disabled and is not working.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: GENERAL: 35 pound weight loss over the pastthree years. ENT: Recent blurring of vision.NEUROLOGICAL: Numbness and tingling on the left foot dorsalsurface. CARDIOVASCULAR: Hypertension , but no known history ofcardiac events. PSYCHIATRIC: Admits to some depression.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is an ill appearing , uncomfortablegentleman in mild distress on admission.VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile. Blood pressure 130/82. Pulse 84.Respiratory rate 16. SKIN: Warm and dry. There are no palpablenodes. HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. LUNGS: Clear toauscultation throughout. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. NormalS1/S2. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , with active bowel sounds.NEUROLOGICAL: The patient is alert and oriented times three.EXTREMITIES: There is no edema. There is a right groin incisionwith slight separation of the surgical wound at its most distalaspect , approximately one centimeter magnitude. PULSES: Poplitealpulse is by Doppler only on both sides. The posterior tibial pulseis non Dopplerable. The dorsalis pedis pulse is detectable withDoppler , stronger on the left than on the right. On the left foot ,there were two necrotic areas on the heel approximately 0.5centimeter in diameter. The first metatarsal joint has a 1.2centimeter wound which is dry , tender and not erythematous outsideof its margins , boggy at the distal aspect. There is a smallamount of tan exudate present at the distal wound edge. On theright foot , there is a distal lateral wound 4.6 centimeters inwidth , 3.1 centimeters in length , and 1 centimeter deep. There ispale green fluffing on the plantar edge of the wound. The rightheel has a 4.2 X 2.5 centimeter open area approximately 2-3millimeters deep in the wound bed; pink with scattered whitematerial fluffing. There is no surrounding erythema or bogginess.LABORATORY DATA: On admission , glucose was 81 , sodium 137 ,potassium 4.7 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 26 , BUNand creatinine of 18 and 0.9 respectively. CK was 145. CBC was asfollows: white blood cell count of 10 , hematocrit 43.1 , platelets425 , with a normal differential. Urinalysis was notable only for1+ protein on the dip.HOSPITAL COURSE: During admission , the patient underwent a leftfemoropopliteal bypass graft and split thicknessskin grafting to the right fifth toe amputation site , as well asdebridement of other lower extremity wounds on April .  Hetolerated the procedure well and postoperatively progressed withoutcomplications. He was taken off epidural pain medications andswitched to p.o. medications and resumed a regular diet shortlyafter the operation. The debrided wounds on the right foot weretreated with Xeroform dressings covered with Kerlix and an Acebandage. These wounds have shown signs of vascularity and healing ,and the split thickness skin graft has taken in a satisfactorymanner. The patient has begun to increase his activity with theguidance of the physical therapist , and is now moving on crutcheswith touch down weight bearing of the right foot and no weightbearing on the right side. There were no complications during thisadmission. The patient complained of some blurring in the righteye. This was followed by an Ophthalmology consult , during whichit was determined that there has likely been a gradual decline inthe patient's vision due to a combination of development ofcataracts as well as peripheral vascular disease. It was felt thatthe appropriate management would be to have the patient return toOphthalmology Clinic on an outpatient basis.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Vasotec 5 milligrams p.o. q.d.; Glyburide5 milligrams p.o. q.d.; Wellbutrin 75milligrams p.o. q.d.; heparin 5 , 000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.;CZI sliding scale insulin subcutaneously; Ativan 1 milligram p.o.q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia; Betadine topical ointment to surgical woundsite; MSIR 15-30 milligrams p.o. q.3-4h. p.r.n. pain; Lanolinointment to the feet q.d.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.DISPOSITION: To rehabilitation facility.FOLLOW-UP: 1 ) The patient will follow-up with Eton Medical Center atAller Hospital in approximately one week;appointment as indicated in the discharge instructions in theSidpro Hospital And Nursing Home computer. 2 ) Follow-up in Tampa Rekcare Ta Hospital in three weeks to start regular outpatientmedical management of the patient's medical issues. 3 )Ophthalmology Clinic follow-up in three weeks to address theblurring of the vision recently.ESTIMATED DISABILITY: The patient is disabled and has beenprior to admission.Dictated By: BARRETT KAMMERZELL , M.D.Attending: OMAR N.

848063016 | S | 53811923 | | 190664 | 10/20/1996 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 7/21/1996 Report Status: SignedDischarge Date: 10/1/1996PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION , KNOWN CORONARY ARTERYDISEASE.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old gentlemanwith chest pain syndrome and knowncoronary artery disease admitted with increasing exertionaldyspnea , thought to be his anginal equivalent. He was admitted formedical management and possible laser angioplasty of an occludedleft circumflex coronary artery. In January 1995 , the patient wasadmitted with an acute chest pain syndrome. Cardiaccatheterization , at that time , demonstrated 100% occlusion of theleft circumflex artery which was heavily calcified and not amenableto balloon angioplasty. The patient underwent an exercisetolerance test on May , 1995 where he exercised six minutes andstopped secondary to fatigue. The patient had no chest discomfortor ECG changes during the exercise test. He was discharged home ona medical regimen , including enteric coated aspirin ,hydrochlorothiazide 25 once a day , metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. , nitropatch 0.2 mg per hour , and sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. Thepatient also continued on Verapamil SR 240 mg b.i.d. for his highblood pressure. At home , the patient reports that he has not beenexercising as frequently as he used to and his exercise regimenusually consisted of 15 minutes on a ski machine three times aweek. He continues to get some exertional dyspnea and also hasepisodes of chest pain , usually after a meal , while he is lying inbed. This probably represents a reflux disease. Due to theincreasing frequency of his dyspneic episodes with exertion , thepatient contacted his primary cardiologist , Jared Stockel , and itwas felt that he probably needed to be admitted for better medicalmanagement and to have an attempted laser angioplasty of hisoccluded left circumflex artery.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin one tablet p.o.q.day , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.q.day , Verapamil SR 240 b.i.d. , K-Dur 10 mEq q.day , Lopressor 100mg p.o. b.i.d. , and nitro patch 0.2 mg times two patches times twohours q.day.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an elderly gentleman in noapparent distress. His heart rate was 52and regular. Blood pressure was 160/94. HEENT examination wasunremarkable. His lungs were clear. Cardiovascular examinationwas significant for an S4 , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs. His abdomenwas benign. His extremities had no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.LABORATORY DATA: His ECG showed sinus bradycardia at 56 with leftanterior vesicular block and right bundle branchblock , borderline left atrial enlargement. Chest x-ray was clear.SMA-7 was normal other than a slightly high creatinine at 1.7 and alow potassium of 3.1. He had a normal CBC and normal PT/PTT.ASSESSMENT: In summary , this is a 76-year-old gentleman with knowncoronary artery disease , known occlusion of the leftcircumflex with an exercise tolerance test one year ago withoutevidence for ischemia. He presents with chest pain , shortness ofbreath syndrome , etiology of which is unclear.HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Cardiology NY team wherehe underwent a exercise tolerance test on April ,1996 , during which he went 4 minutes and 22 seconds. He stoppedsecondary to dyspnea on exertion and leg fatigue with no chestpain. He had nonspecific changes in his ECG , and his MIBI imagesrevealed inferolateral ischemia. On July , 1996 , he underwentcardiac catheterization with laser assisted PTCA of his leftcircumflex lesion , which he tolerated well. His postcatheterization course was slightly complicated by increasedbleeding from the groin site , as well as the possible developmentof a hematoma versus pseudoaneurysm as a bruit was heard in theright groin. This was evaluated with a vascular ultrasound whichshowed no hematoma and no pseudoaneurysm. He was observedovernight and was discharged on 8/26/96 in stable condition. Hisblood pressure medications were manipulated for better control ofhis significant hypertension , as well as for increased outpatientcompliance. During his hospitalization , urine cultures were sentwhich grew alpha hemolytic Streptococcus. This was treated withampicillin initially and he will be sent home on pen-VK. Also ofnote , during this admission , hemoglobin A1C was sent which wasslightly elevated at 7. He started on glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.day.However , the patient felt that he did not need to take this andrefused it. His medical team felt that it was more important forhim to be compliant with his hypertension and cardiac medications ,at this juncture , and the issue of restarting glyburide will bebrought up in the outpatient setting by Dr. Boncella . He isdischarged today , August , 1996 with VNA services to monitormedicine compliance and measure blood pressures , as well as for ahome safety evaluation.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.day ,hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.day , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.day ,Adalat CC 30 mg p.o. q.day , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tabletsublingually q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain , Prilosec 20mg p.o. q.day , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and pen-VK 250 mgp.o. q.i.d. times five days.Dictated By: JAMEY QUENTIN GROPPER , M.D. KV71Attending: SAMMIE E.

There were T-waveinversions in II and T-wave flattening in III , pseudonormalizationin V2-V3 , with upright T-waves in V4 , V5 , and V6 compared to a10/23/91 tracing. Because of the atypical nature of the chest painand because it did not reproduce the chest pain that he had inSeptember , the patient was not put on IV heparin. He was given anexercise stress test , full Bruce protocol , the following day whichshowed marked lateral 3-4 mm depressions in the lateral leads ,consistent with ischemia.

Shewas transfused with 2 U PRBC initially , placed NPO , IVF and GI consultwas obtained. GI took her to endoscopy and did upper endoscopy onmorning of November .  They found a friable ulcer located at an anastomosissite from her previous bypass surgery. No active bleeding and bloodvessels were identified at the area. This represents the likely sourceof her bleed. 2 more units of blood were ordered to keep goal over 30but she only bumped to 26.6 from 20 after total of four units initially.It is possible the blood was drawn distal to where IVF was adminiteredand there could have a been a dilutional effect. One more unit was givenfor a total of five which put her over 30. Her HCT was monitored andstayed stable at 30 after that for the remainder of her hospitalization.She was placed on BID PPI. Her asprin and plavix were held on admissionas well as her BP meds.---CV: She does have a history of CAD s/p MI and coronary stents. Shehad a negative MiBi a month prior to admission. A set of enzymes uponadmission were negative , another troponin was negative on the13 of June .  Her HTN meds were held upon admission. Her goal HCT is >30given CAD. She is on digoxin for question of afib which was onhold during admission. Cardiac telemetry revealed no events. She had oneepisode of "chest pain" on the night of the 13 of June which was actuallylocated in the epigastric region. An EKG was performed at that timewhich was unchanged from the admission EKG. She was HD stable withoutevent on telemetry. She received NTG tabs X3 without any relief and afollow up troponin was negative for the third time.---PAIN: She was continued on current pain regimen.---PPX: Teds , Pneumoboots---ENDO: She was continued home Levothyroxine---GI: She was constipated during admission and had not had a bowelmovement despite very aggressive regimen. Her abd became slightlydistended. The patient then started to refuse bowel meds as she wasgetting prepared for discharge and was afraid to have movement on ridehome. She agreed to maintain agressive regimen at home and was instructedto follow up with PCP or ER if she can not produce results within a day.---She was stable for discharge on January and discharged with instructionsto follow up with PCP within two weeks or sooner if lightheadedness ,bloody or black stools , vomiting , chest pain or other concerns.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:DISCHARGE CONDITION: StableTO DO/PLAN:No dictated summaryENTERED BY: HORROCKS , ISIDRO , PA-C ( IF08 ) 11/18/06 @ 11:08 AM****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******

Fullreport as follows: 1. Peak METS = 5.7 2. Duke Treadmill Score = +4( Moderate risk: -10 to +4 ) 3. HR Recovery = 29ASSESSMENT:1. Diagnosis: No evidence for ischemia at HR achieved.Reduced sensitivity because ECG uninterpretable due to rate related LBBB.2. Prognosis: Elevated prognostic risk based on low functional capacityand a low Duke score of +4 ( Moderate risk: -10 to +4 ). 3.Arrhythmia:Probable rate related LBBB at peak. 4. Hemodynamics: Normal exercisehemodynamics.Cardiology was consulted and they recommended a MIBI and echo tobetter evaluate her cardiac function. She then underwent a MIBI whichshowed a small inferior septaldefect , which was thought to likely beartifact. Given the small area , it was felt medical management would bethe best approach. She was discharged on small dose of bblocker , aceinhibitor asa and statin.Pump: The patient's lasix had recently been increased to 60 mg bid.

She was hospitalized at that time and had a left calf deepvenous thrombosis secondary to extended bedrest. Her joint diseaseinvolved primarily the L4 to S1 vertebra ( comprising two jointspaces , and she reported this to have been exacerbated by anattempted rape in 1980. At present , the patient suffersconsiderable daily pain inhibiting her ability to work. Thepatient recently received a facet block in October of 1991 at theDukey Darnha Hospital by the Pain Service which only seemedto increase her pain. She described steadily worsening pain inrecent months and an increased portion of her time is therefore nowspent at bedrest due to her decreased mobility. The patientdescribed first experiencing left calf pain one and a half weeksprior to this admission which manifested itself as a crampy pain ofshort duration. She apparently saw her private medical doctor atthis time , Dr. Denver Lehnen , who sent her out on nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs. On 4/12 , five days prior to admission ,the patient awoke at night with severe right leg cramping. She , atthat time , went to the Mutes Hospital EmergencyRoom where a noninvasive vascular study was positive for nonobstructive peroneal vein thrombosis. She was discharged onAnaprox. On 4/29 , the patient returned to the DMC Emergency Roomcomplaining of increased pain and with great anxiety due to herperceived risk of pulmonary embolus. The patient has had thiscondition in the past and was quite concerned about it. Noninvasivevascular studies at that time showed the lesion to be obstrutive inthe peroneal vein. However , there was no evidence of deep venousthrombosis at that time. She was discharged on Coumadin , 5 mg qday. On 8/18 , the patient experienced further worsening pain andcame to the Versteo University Medical Center for a second opinion. Shewas heparinized in the Emergency Room and admitted to the MedicalService. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denied chest pain ,shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion , abdominal pain , nausea ,vomiting , diarrhea or constipation , any recent weight loss or anyadditional constitution of symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Occasional migraine headaches. L4-5 ruptured disc status post busaccident in 1977. As stated above , she had a left lower extremitydeep venous thrombosis following that hospitalization. Previouspositive PPD , she had one year of treatment. Mugging in 1980 withexacerbation of her joint disease. Emergency Room admission in 1988for questionable cholecystitis. Facet block times two in 1986 and1991. Periods of incremental menorrhagia. She is followed by Dr.Ceo at the Warestar Medical Center .  Endometrial biopsyrecently performed was negative. Asthma. Gastritis. Appendectomy.ALLERGIES: FISH. ERYTHROMYCIN. LACTOSE INTOLERANCE.

He had cardiacrisk factors including possible hypertension and possible historyof hypercholesterolemia. The patient had had a history of atypicalchest pain including cardiac work-up in the past with an echo in1995 showing concentric left ventricular hypertrophy withasymmetric septal hypertrophy. He had a normal ejection fractionat this time. In 8/7 , he had an exercise tolerance test at whichtime he went eight minutes with a maximal heart rate of 151 ,maximum blood pressure of 226/90 , and no EKG changes. At 2 p.m. onthe day of admission , he developed substernal chest pain withcrushing tightness radiating to both shoulders and his jaw. He wasnot short of breath. He experienced this pain on and off throughthe afternoon although the pain was never completely gone. At 6p.m. , he became acutely worse and at that time , called the EMT andwas brought to the Agund Hospital EmergencyDepartment. Within the Emergency Department , the patient was notedto have ST elevations in the inferior leads. He was enrolled inthe TONSCHAPTECH MEDICAL CENTER trial. Infusion was begun at 8:15. The patient wasgiven Lopressor , oxygen , morphine , aspirin , and Heparin. He didnot drop his pressure with the sublingual nitroglycerin.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Included prostate cancer in 8/21 statuspost x-ray therapy as well as a possibletransient ischemic attack in 1990.ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Zantac p.r.n.FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was married with three children and hedenied any tobacco or alcohol use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission demonstrated a well appearingblack male in no acute distress. His vitalsigns were a heart rate of 48 , blood pressure 83/30 in theEmergency Department , and he was afebrile with oxygen saturation of99% on two liters. HEENT: Examination showed oropharynx benignand he had a left facial droop. NECK: Supple , 2+ carotids withoutbruit , and jugular venous pressure was normal. CHEST: Clear toauscultation bilaterally. HEART: Had a regular bradycardic rhythmwith a II/VI systolic ejection murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender ,and nondistended with positive normal bowel sounds and noorganomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Warm , well perfused , and no clubbing ,cyanosis , or edema with trace distal pulses. NEUROLOGICAL: He wasalert and oriented times three , cranial nerves II-XII were grosslyintact except for a left facial droop , and motor and sensory weregrossly intact.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission showed a sodium of 144 ,potassium 4.2 , chloride 108 , bicarbonate22 , BUN 16 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 136 , white count was 8 with ahematocrit of 35 , platelets were 239 , CK was 276 with an MB of 0.8 ,troponin on admission was 0.0 , INR was 1.0 , and PTT was 22.6.Patient's first EKG in the Emergency Department showed normal sinusrhythm at 70 with first degree AV block , axis of 56 degrees , he hadST elevations of 4 mm in leads III and aVF and 3 mm in II , and STdepression of 0.5 to 3 mm in V2 through V5 , I , and aVL. Chestx-ray did not show acute disease in the Emergency Department.HOSPITAL COURSE: Within the Emergency Department , the patientinitially had resolution of his EKG changes buthad persistent jaw pain remaining at 10/25 .  He was taken tocatheterization which demonstrated a mid right coronary arterylesion of approximately 95% with a clot but with TIMI 3 flow. Nointervention was done at that time. Patient initially requiredvigorous intravenous hydration to maintain good blood pressure butremained essentially stable and pain free. He had a drop in hishematocrit from 35 on admission to 28 after his catheterizationsecondary to blood loss at the right femoral triple-lumen siteplaced in the Emergency Ward prior to TPA , blood loss atcatheterization , small hematoma , and dilution. He was given twounits of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in hishematocrit. The patient was then transferred to the floor where hemaintained his good course. He had no postcatheterization orpostmyocardial infarction chest pain. The decision was then madeto take the patient back to the catheterization laboratory to havePTCA with stenting of his lesion and to see if it continued topersist. The patient was taken on the day prior to discharge backto the catheterization laboratory where he was successfullyangioplastied and stented. Immediately on returning to the floor ,the patient did have a rigor postcatheterization but he remainedafebrile and did well over the remainder of his hospital course.It was felt that the rigor was probably related to allergicreaction to the dye as he was treated with Benadryl and steroidswithout complication.DISPOSITION: The patient will have visiting nurse services. Hewill have blood drawn to check platelets in two daysas he had a fall in his platelet level to 60 after theadministration of the reapro. He will also need follow-up CBC intwo and four weeks because he is on ticlid.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , sublingualnitroglycerin p.r.n. chest pain , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , andticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to complete a two week course.FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Marvin Snachez ,cardiologist with EANH .  He will have echocardiogramdone on his first hospital visit. The patient will also follow-upwith Dr. Lorenzo Campoverde in the clinical trial center as follow-up forhis participation in the OERD HOSPITAL study.Dictated By: PETER KRENZ , M.D. OJ18Attending: LESTER THEO BEBOUT , M.D. NK6  EG097/8025Batch: 48506 Index No. CHKEO54NUZ D: 4/26/97T: 3/30/97

The patient was transferred to the intensive care unitfor the neurological service of Teaspell Diee Hospital .HOSPITAL COURSE: Blood pressure monitoring was instituted perprotocol , nasal oxygen was given and no antiplatelettherapy was given for 24 hours. Head of bed was raised to 30degrees. Head CT was repeated the following morning , the resultsof which show that there is slight left basal ganglion internalcapsule , acute and subacute infarct in the left middle cerebralartery distribution which was evolving from the previous study.THere was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. The patient hadfurther investigations to look for a cause of this presumed embolicstroke. She had an echocardiogram done which showed the aorticroot at 3.5 cm , the atrium at 3.2 which is slightly dilated. Therewas normal ventricular size and overall preserved systolicfunction , trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation ,trace mitral regurgitation. Holter monitor was done which showedpersistent atrial flutter. The patient was coumadinized and somediscussion pertaining to cardioversion was entertained by theelectrophysiology service. However , this was not done as aninpatient. The patient continued to do remarkably well after herintravenous thrombolysis over the next couple of days. She hadpersistent drift on the right arm; however , her speech remainedcompletely normal. SHe was reviewed by the chronic pain service onseveral occasions for chronic back and leg pain. She reachednormal levels of Coumadin within several days and was dischargedwithout rehabilitation. She will be followed by the cardiacservice and a plan for complete cardioversion was instituted withinone month. The patient went home on Coumadin.

Ms. Guerena was recently admitted forCHF flare and received intravenous diuresis. She reponded well andwas discharged at a dry weight of approximately 185 pounds. Ms.Kimmell presented on this admission with 2 days of increasing SOB ,abdominal discomfort , nausea and vomitting. She denied increasingedema , change in number of pillows. She did endorse PND present butstates that it is unchanged. In ED , the patient was afebile , initally with oxygen saturation in the high 90's on 2 L. BP 154/84. BNP wasgreater than 3000. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Abdominal CT wasobtained due to concern for the patients abdominal pain and showedan engorged , fatty liver , ascites , pleural effusions ( not seenon CXR ). A surgical consult was obtained and the surgeons felt thepatients abdominal pain was not surgical in nature but rather secondaryto CHF.Hospital Course:1 ) Cardiovascular: a ) Pump- CHF exacerbation. We diuresed the patientinitially with intravenous lasix until her respiratory statusimroved and the patient was able to maintain good oxygen saturation onroom air. At the time of discharge her oxygen saturation on room airwas in the high 90's and was between 94-96 % with ambulation. Wecontinued the patient's home doses of beta blocker , angiotensionreceptor blocker and statin. The patient was again encouraged toadhere to a low-salt diet and weight herself daily. The patient will bedischarged on Torsemide 100 mg po q am and 50 mg po q pm , a regimine thas worked will for the patient in the past.

The patietns electrolytes and magnesiumwere monitored and rempleted and she was maintained on a beta blocker.On 2/14 the EP service placed a VVI/R ICD device without complications.It was interogated ont he day of d/c and the patietn was provided withwritten instructions from the EP service for d/c. She will follow-upwith the Dr. Cradduck on 10/30 as described. c ) Ischemia:Patient with a history of CAD.ED initially concerned for a myocardial infarction. She was ruled out for an MI with negative cardiac enzymes x 3. Serial EKG'swere unchanged. We continued the patient on ASA , beta blocker , statin and ARB. 2 )Heme: Ms. Egerton has a history of DVT , therapeuticon coumadin at the time of admission. We did decreased herdose while being treated with levofloxacin. In addition her coumadinwas held for her EP procedure. At the time of d/c she will beresuming her regular dose of coumadin and should follow-up at herusualy JMC lab to have her INR checked on Thursday 5/6 .  3 )ID: +UA onadmission treated for three days with levofloxacin. ( Last day was11/19/4 ). Her cx grew citrobacter which was sensitive to levo. RepeatUA was negative. 4 ) GI: Abdominal discomfort presumably dueto hepatic congestion. Abdominal CT showed no acute surgical process.Abdominal pain was resolved with diuresis. She does have achronic elevated alk phos which may be related to hersarcoid. 6 )Endocrine: Continuedlevoxyl for the patient's hypothyroid. Pt with IDDM.

This dyspnea was associatedwith chest heaviness , but the patient denies nausea , diaphoresis ,or radiation. The patient reports similar symptoms when shepresented in 4/5 to an outside hospitalization and was ultimatelystented for a left circumflex lesion. On the day of admit , thepatient was seen at the Odaughters Nyco Centspan Hospital , where she wasapparently in respiratory distress , and treated with oxygen ,nitroglycerin , aspirin , Lasix , CPAP , and morphine. Chest x-ray , byreport , showed CHF. The patient improved with diuresis and wasadmitted on a R/O protocol for flash pulmonary edema. Hertroponin-I and initial two CKs were flat. She was then transferredhere for cardiac cath , as cardiac ischemia was the suspectedculprit for her presentation. The patient states she sleeps withone pillow. She has no PND or palpitations.

EKG ,on admission , showed a normal sinus rhythm at 70 , LVH with probablestrain laterally. No significant changes from an EKG done on1/25/99 .  Of note , an EKG done at the outside hospital on 2/10showed inverted Ts in I , L , and V2-V6.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to this hospital with arecent episode of flash pulmonary edema. Whenthis had happened previously , cardiac catheterization had revealedan occluded left circumflex lesion that was stented. There were ,therefore , concerns that the patient may have re-occlusion eitherof the stent or of one of her other vessels. Her metformin washeld. She was given pre-cath hydration fluids , and then sheunderwent cardiac catheterization. The results of this study wereas follows: The patient had a 40% ostial LAD lesion and an 80% midD1 lesion , both of which showed no change from her priorcatheterization. The patient left circumflex stent was widelypatent. The patient's RCA was noted to be occluded and was fillingwith collaterals from left to right. At the time of thecatheterization , the patient's renal arteries are also evaluated.There was a question of an ostial left renal artery stenosis.However , no other renal disease was noted.Because the patient's catheterization was unchanged from a priorstudy , it was unclear as to the significance of her D1 lesion. Forthis reason , the patient underwent an ETT MIBI , the results ofwhich are as follows: The patient underwent a modified Bruce ,heart rate of 66% of maximum predicted heart rate. She exercisedfor 4 minutes 30 seconds and stopped secondary to dyspnea. She hadno new EKG changes and no chest pain. The MIBI portion of the testshowed a nontransmural anterior and inferior MI , with peri-infarctischemia involving 3-5 segments. At the time of this dictation , itis felt that the patient's CAD is an unlikely explanation for herpresentation. Dr. Dibernardo will review the MIBI results and decidewhether a repeat catheterization with PCI is warranted. The mostlikely explanation is that the patient has diastolic dysfunctiongiven her age and history of diabetes. Dr. Hake is interested inenrolling her in a study that evaluates angiotensin receptorblockers in treatment of this disorder.The patient had an echo during this hospitalization. The leftventricle is mildly dilated with an EF of 50%. The patient hasapical , septal , and lateral hypokinesis. Her right ventricle sizeand function is normal. The patient also has a dilated left atriumwith mild mitral regurgitation.DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with her primary carephysician in two weeks and her primarycardiologist in four weeks.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.Please note that an addendum to this discharge summary will beadded with the patient's discharge medications.Dictated By: SPENCER GULINO , M.D. AL56Attending: GUILLERMO W.

She likelyhas more than one medical issue going on simultaneously.--CV:ISCHEMIA: Pt has known CAD. Worsening angina with exertion. No s/sof ACS currently. EKG shows no ST segment elevations. Checked set ofcardiac enzymes which were negative. She was continued on asa , statin , BB-PUMP: The pt has history of diastolic heart failure. ECHO over one yearago showed EF 55-60%. It also showed severe tricuspid regurgitation. Hersymptoms of DOE , fatigue , LE swelling , abd girth could also be explainedby Cor Pulmonale or worsening heart failure. A CXR was performedwhich showed stable cardiomegaly and no signs of overt edema butclinically with her elevated JVP , increased abd girth and LE edemawere suggestive of fluid overload. BNP was low at 122 but likely she wassomewhat overloaded. An ECHO was performed which showed elevatedpulm artery pressure of 45 , moderate tricuspid regurgitation , mild tomoderately enlarged R ventricle and moderately enlarged Right atrium. EFof 60%. These findings are suggestive of potential cor pulmonale. Plan isto diurese pt as outpt and repeat ECHO by PCP as outpt , thenconsideration of cardiology referral. Lisinopril is added as allergy( hyperkalemia ) , perhaps can be given as small dose with close monitoring.Defer to PCP. The pt was placed on strict I/Os , daily weights. Avoidedfluid restriction given low BP for now.-RHYTHM: The pt has fatigue , dizziness , nausea raising the concern fordig toxicity. She also has known afib. A digoxin level was checked andcame back at 1.4 which might be slightly high for her renal function ,age and muscle mass. Her digoxin dose was therefore decreased to 0.125mgdaily. She was monitored on telemetry which showed frequent ventricularpacing and occasional PVCs.---ORTHO: The pt had CT of cervical spine in October '07 for neck painradiating to the L , as is her current presentation. The CT showed DJDbut no fracture or other concerning finding. No recent trauma. Her painis likely from worsening DJD. Plan conservative intervention withhotpacks , Tylenol. No further imaging indicated. Home PT planned.---NEURO: The pt has hx of CVA but current CTA shows no evidence ofacute CVA. Her Neuro exam is fairly unremarkable despite multiplevague complaints of weakness , numbness , pain. She was continued onasa. Neuro exam monitored without focal deficits. Treated headache withTylenol. If the pt's overall pain persists , she might benefit from painconsult as outpt---PULM: Pt has no known pulm disease but has been prescribed albuterolinhaler.

Based on physical exam it wasnot felt that she was in heart failure. However , with hx of CAD , thiswas investigated with Echo which showd nl EF and heart function. TheEcho also showed nl RV fxn and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.Chronic PE and lung parechymal diseases were investigated with chest CTwhich was negative for PE. It also showed moderate to severecentrilobular emphysema with no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. Shehad PFTs the day of admission which showed decreased lung volumes allconsistent with a restrictive lung pattern. Given the diagnosticdilemma , the Pulmonary service was consulted , which did not feel thatdoe was due solely to pulm etiologies. Thus , desat is unexplained. Ptwill be sent home on o2 to be used during exertion only.2. CV: The patient has a hx of hypertension and is being followed byher Cardiologist Dr. Stouch . Per Dr. Hehr recommendation , her norvascwas discontinued as was her atenolol. Desats could bedue to transient diastolic dysfunction w/ exertion.

She firstdeveloped discoid lupus in 1983. She subsequently over the yearsdeveloped arthralgias of various joints , was treated with aspirin ,Motrin and steroids. In 1985 , she developed pleuritic substernalchest pain. She was diagnosed at Westten Hospital with pericarditisand underwent pericardiocentesis. In 1988 , she was seen at theArthritis Clinic by Dr. Goerlitz , who noted a discoid lupus onexamination , a mild anemia , sedimentation rate 85 , CH-50 178 , VNApositive at 1:160 , positive anti-double-stranded DNA and 3+positive Smith/anti-Smith antibody. She was treated with Plaquenil200 bid , plus aspirin and Naprosyn. In 5 of October , she was diagnosedwith a lupus flare and was put on prednisone 30 q am. She did welland in 24 of October the steroids were tapered off and discontinued.However , she presented with substernal chest pain at that time andhad her prednisone restarted. She was put on another prednisonetaper. In 23 of March , she had a negative brain magnetic resonanceimaging. In 21 of April , she had an echocardiogram which showedpericardial thickening without evidence of constriction consistentwith prior pericarditis. Over the following several months , shehad occasional flares because of medical noncompliance. She wasput on Plaquenil 200 bid , which was increased to tid , and Motrin800 bid. In 2 of January , she again came to the emergency room withsubsternal chest pain and a mild pulsus paradoxus , no jugularvenous distention. An electrocardiogram was without change. Chestx-ray showed slight increase in the heart size. She was placed onprednisone 30 q day , Tylenol with codeine and did well. On16 of October , she was seen in the clinic and had substernal chest painconsistent with pericardial pain , dyspnea on exertion , increasedarthralgias secondary to discontinuing her steroids. At that time ,she had her Plaquenil and prednisone restarted. Over the last 3weeks prior to admission she noticed that the prednisone andPlaquenil increased stomachaches and she stopped the medication.Over the last 7 days prior to admission , she has had increasingdyspnea on exertion and substernal chest pain , which is sharp ,increases with cough or deep breaths. She denied any orthopnea orparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations or syncope. She has nonausea , vomiting , fevers , chills or melena. She does haveincreasing joint pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY revealed seizuredisorder with Dilantin , hypothyroidism treated with L-thyroxine ,iron deficiency anemia without prior work-up , thoracic spinecompression fractures , gastritis questionably secondary toNaprosyn. She has no known ALLERGIES. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSIONwere Plaquenil 200 bid , Motrin 80 tid , prednisone 10 q am , Dilantin400 q am , L-thyroxine 0.2 q day , folate 1 mg po q day , iron sulfate225 tid , Diprosone Ointment bid. She does not smoke or drink.FAMILY HISTORY is negative for collagen vascular diseases. She isthe mother of 5 children.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was an obese Hispanic female in milddistress. Temperature was 99 , pulse 60 ,blood pressure 130/70 , respirations 18 , pulsus paradoxus of 10.Skin showed numerous discoid lesions of the scalp , face and rightforearm and lower extremities with patchy alopecia. Head , eyes ,ears , nose and throat examination was unremarkable. Neck wassupple , no adenopathy noted. Chest was clear. Cardiac examinationshowed regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , with a I/VI systolicejection murmur at the left lower sternal border , otherwise no rubsor gallops. Back showed no costovertebral angle or spinaltenderness. Abdominal examination was benign , liver is 10 cm , andthe spleen tip is not palpable. Rectal examination was guaiacnegative , soft brown stools. She does have external hemorrhoids.Extremities were negative without cords or Homan's sign. Neurologicexamination was grossly intact , with normal cranial nerve function ,motor , sensory , coordination and deep tendon reflexes , except forquestion of slight slowing of the relaxation phase of the reflexesin the upper and lower extremities. Musculoskeletal examinationshowed diffuse bilateral asymmetric synovial thickening withslightly decreased range of motion most notably in the right elbow ,right metacarpophalangeal joint , left carpal , bilateral knees andankles.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrolytes were all within normallimits. Her CK was 76. Dilantin level5.6. White count was 4.7 , hematocrit 30 , platelets 352 , 000 , meancorpuscular volume 83 , ESR 88 , oxygen saturation 99% on room air.Urinalysis showed specific gravity 1.026 , 2+ protein , 10 to 15white cells , 8 to 10 red blood cells and a few granular casts.Chest x-ray showed increased heart size , otherwise negative , nochange from 2 of January .  She does have multiple thoracic compressionfractures and osteopenia. The electrocardiogram showed sinusrhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions at a rateof approximately 70 , positive 45 degree axis , normal intervals ,T-wave inversion in III and V2 through V3 without changes in the PRor ST segments compared with 2 of January , and no decrease in thevoltages.HOSPITAL COURSE: Problem #1 was substernal chest pain. Thisseemed to be a pericardial pain secondary todiscontinuation of her prednisone and Plaquenil as it happenednumerous times in the past. She was ruled out for a myocardialinfarction. She had an echocardiogram which showed a small amountof pericardial fluid without evidence of right ventricularindentation or compromise. She was placed back on her Plaquenil200 bid , and prednisone 30 q day and did well in that regard.Problem #2 was decreased hematocrit. This was felt to be probablysecondary to hydration as the hematocrit on hospital day #2 wentfrom 31 to 27 with several liters of intravenous fluid. Stoolguaiacs were negative throughout the hospitalization. Thehematocrit remained stable between 27 and 30 without transfusionsor further intervention. She did have a Coombs test sent which wasmildly positive , although her hematocrit was stable. She wasdischarged on folate and iron. Problem #3 is hematuria and pyuriaat the time of admission. Urine culture and urine gram stain wereboth negative for infection and this was followed up with a 24-hoururine collection for protein to assess for potential lupusinvolvement of the kidney , and this will need to be followed up on.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged for FOLLOW-UP inRheumatology Clinic with Dr. Grondin . MEDICATIONSON DISCHARGE included Plaquenil 200 bid , prednisone 20 q day ,Dilantin 400 q day , L-thyroxine 0.2 q am , Motrin 800 tid , Carafate ,iron and folate.________________________________ AB000/8714DARRELL PITCAVAGE , M.D. AC8 D: 5/2/90Batch: 8321 Report: D9184R24 T: 10/10/90Dictated By: JOESPH ZUEHL , M.D.

Status post wound debridement left heel 4/10/06 by Dr.Ira Pollart , vascular surgery.2. Status post hemodialysis tunneled catheter placement leftchest 1/27/06 by interventional radiology.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Infectious disease: Line sepsis. The patient was treatedwith broad-spectrum antibiotics and initially treated withvancomycin , ceftazidime , and clindamycin as well as gentamicin.She underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram that was negativefor valvular vegetation and she showed no stigmata ofendocarditis. She had blood cultures from 8/17/2006 that werepositive for vancomycin resistant enterococcus and her antibioticregimen was changed to linezolid and clindamycin to cover foranaerobes in her left heel. The patient's tunneled hemodialysiscatheter was removed on hospital day #2 in the setting of linesepsis. The patient remained afebrile and will complete a 21-daycourse of linezolid for VRE line sepsis. Repeat blood cultures show no growthto date. The patientwas also admitted with chronic left heel osteomyelitis. The patient hadplain films that showed evidence of osteomyelitis. The VascularSurgery Service was consulted and the patient underwentdebridement of her left heel on 4/10/06 by Dr. Angeloni and Dr.Kalan . The patient will most likely need a left below-the-knee amputationin the future most. The patient's wound culture grew outMorganella morganii. However , in discussion with the Medicalteam , the patient was not treated with antibiotic coverage forthis positive wound culture. A vacuum dressing was temporarilyplaced to her wound and currently the wound is being treated witht.i.d. wet-to-dry dressings. The patient did have a chest x-raythat could have been compatible with an early left lower lobepneumonia , and had some low grade fevers during this admission. The patientwill also be discharged on a 10 day course of renally dosed Levaquin to coverfor possible community acquired pneumonia. The patient also had abdominalpain and fevers on admission and had an abdominal CT scan without evidence ofabdominal abscess or other intraabdominal acute process.2. Renal: The patient has end-stage renal disease , onhemodialysis. She had her hemodialysis catheter removal. Shehad negative blood cultures from 5/16/06 and the InterventionalRadiology Service placed another left chest tunneled hemodialysiscatheter on 1/27/06 .  The patient was started on Nephrocaps ,PhosLo as well as Plavix during this admission.3. Cardiovascular: The patient had an admission chest x-raywith an enlarged cardiac silhouette. She underwent atransthoracic echocardiogram that revealed an EF of 55% andtrivial pericardial effusion. She showed no signs of cardiactamponade. The patient was continued on low-dose beta-blockadeand her lisinopril was restarted during the admission. She didhave periods of hypertension during the admission , thought to bein the setting of volume overload. This did improve withup-titration of her beta-blocker and hemodialysis. She will bedischarged on lisinopril as well as Toprol-XL. She was monitoredon telemetry throughout the admission.4. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient tolerated arenal fluid restricted diet. She did have hyperkalemia of 6.3during the admission , which was treated appropriately. Thepatient's hyperkalemia did improve with hemodialysis. Thepatient did have difficult peripheral IV access during theadmission. However , she did refuse a central line.5. Neurology: The patient has a seizure disorder and wascontinued on Keppra.6. Endocrine: The patient upon admission had elevation of herblood sugars to more than 500. The patient was placed on aninsulin drip , which was titrated off on hospital day #2.Subsequently , on hospital day #2 , the patient did have periods ofhypoglycemia for which she received amps of D50. The patient'sinsulin regimen was adjusted during the admission. Initially ,she was started on NPH 25 once in the evening and NPH 12 unitsonce every morning. In addition , regular insulin 6 units beforeeach meal was added. However , the patient again had periods ofhypoglycemia overnight on 1/27/06 and her insulin regimen waschanged to NPH 12 units subcu b.i.d. with a NovoLog slidingscale. However , she continued to have periods of hypoglycemia. SHe will bedischarged on NPH 8 units sc qam and qac and qhs coverage with a humalogsliding scale. She willbe discharged on this regimen and should followup at Bois Tham General Hospital .7. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots.8. Hematology: The patient's hematocrit was at baseline andstable. The patient did have retroperitoneal lymphadenopathyseen on abdominal CT scan. This will need to be worked up as anoutpatient. This may represent inflammatory changes in thesetting of line sepsis and osteomyelitis however , malignancy willneed to be excluded.9. Pulmonary: The patient had pulmonary nodules seen onabdominal CT scan and will need an outpatient follow-up chest CTto further evaluate these lesions.10. GI: The patient had a low-attenuation area seen within thesmall bowel on CT scan. In discussion with Radiology , we feltthat further imaging as an outpatient could be considered in theform of either CT enterography or small-bowel follow-through.They did not feel that this area represented an area of acutepathology.11. Wound care: The patient requires t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressingchanges for her left heel. She will need to follow up withVascular Surgery in one week at either Ow Community Hospitals , depending on the patient's preference. Sheshould also have dry sterile dressings placed once daily to hermultiple open dermal ulcers that are chronic.DISPOSITION: Full code. The patient will have homeVNA services.FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: The patient will need to follow up witheither Vascular Surgery at Tho Medical Center or with VascularSurgery , Dr. Sehr at 317-001-4753 at Rohall Health in one week. The patient will need to follow up withDr. Cedrick Packingham , 829-459-7212 at Eewood Alum Lopela Community HospitalNephrology Department after she is discharged fromrehabilitation. The patient should also follow up with Dr.??__?? at Boxsan Hospital in two to four weeks.

Plan was to treatas cardiac disease , and evaluate for GI cause. Pt's lopressor was doseadjusted for tachycarida , continued on ASA , ACE , nitrates. Pt notanticoagulated. Cardiology consult felt new symptoms were GI and didnot recommend in-house cardiac catherization. Pt was started onincreased dose of prilosec for presumed gastritis with no evidence ofGIB by hct and heme negative stools. Presumed cause was home asa andprednisone use. Pt will consider outpatient cardiac catherization andintervention. She is scheduled to see Dr. Kallam in 2 weeks and Dr.Drissel promptly after that.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please call your physician with any chest pain that is new , differentin quality , or if accompanied by shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting.Please record the timing and nature of your symptoms if you continue tohave them.

Some of this has been attributed to volume overload andthe patient has had an increased creatinine from approximately inearly February of this year to 5.5 in September .  The patient hadpreviously refused dialysis , but agreed a few weeks ago to beginthe process of dialysis and was scheduled for a fistulaevaluation next week. However , in the past few days , his dyspneaon exertion has accelerated. Whereas , he used to be able to walk40 to 50 feet without shortness of breath , he is now only able towalk 10 feet. Therefore , he is presenting to the emergencydepartment. In the emergency department , he got his home CPAP ,was noted on chest x-ray ( of poor quality ) to have a question ofa left lower lobe consolidation and therefore received one doseof ceftriaxone and azithromycin. His BNP was elevated to 1663( from 655 one year ago ) and his creatinine rose to 5.9 from 5.5in September and 4.1 in February .  Therefore the patient was felt tohave also an element of volume overload and he was admitted tothe renal service for consideration of dialysis and volumeremoval.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.

He is in no apparent distress. Heart isregular rate and rhythm. Heart sounds are distant , but S1 , S2are heard. There is no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. JVP cannot bedetermined. The patient has crackles at the right base. Abdomenis markedly obese with significant lateral edema particularly onthe left side where his pannus tends to fall. There issignificant scrotal edema. The scrotum appears to be about 7inches in diameter. The patient has bilateral 3+ pitting legedema. He has 2+ DP pulses bilaterally. He has closed ulcers onhis abdomen which he states that have been there for severalyears and that he tends to pick at them daily to make them bleed.LABORATORY EXAM:Sodium 145 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 107 , bicarb 21 , BUN 68 ,creatinine 5.9 , glucose 53 , lipase 11 , total bili 1.0 , alk phos153 , BNP 1663 , calcium 7.8 , phosphate 7.3 , magnesium 1.8 ,troponin less than assay , white blood cell count 6.2 , hematocrit33.3 , platelets 144 , 000 , INR 1.3 , BNP was 1663.Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe opacification , but the patientwas not able to stand for a lateral chest x-ray.EKG showed first-degree AV block with poor R wave progression anda question of Q waves in 3 and AVF.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Renal: The patient was felt to be in volume overload. Hischronic renal insufficiency was progressing likely for severalreasons including his chronic hydronephrosis. his focal segmentalglomerular sclerosis , diabetes , and hypertension. He wasinitially given large amounts of Lasix but he failed to diuresesignificantly and his creatinine rose to approximately 7.0.Therefore , a tunneled catheter was placed by vascular surgery andthe patient began urinalysis with the purpose of taking out ofvolume. Approximately 20 liters of volume were taken off overseveral days of dialysis. The patient will continue hemodialysisthree times a week as an outpatient. In addition , he had venousultrasound mapping for likely placement of a permanent AVfistula.2. Pulmonary: The patient continued to wear his CPAP for hissevere obstructive sleep apnea. His breathing improved somewhatduring his hospitalization but it was not possible to tell howwell he would do if he would attempt to walk again as he wassedentary and in bed for his entire hospitalization except foroccasionally sitting up on the side of the bed and moving to abed chair once or twice.3. Infectious Disease: There was not clear evidence of pneumoniacritically or on review of the chest x-ray and therefore thepatient was not specifically treated for pneumonia. However ,upon placement of a Foley catheter , there was a significantamount of white blood cells in the urine and while the urineculture appeared not to be negative , the patient was treated witha 10-day course of levofloxacin ( renally adjusted ) for urinarytract infection. Foley catheter was initially placed by urology.Due to difficulties in the anatomy , it may get hard to place.Once Foley catheter was removed , the patient was able to urinateon his own.4. Cardiovascular:A. Rhythm: The patient was maintained on sotalol and abeta-blocker for his prior history of ventricular tachycardia.He did not have any episodes while inhouse on thishospitalization. The patient's electrophysiologist Dr. Marc C Gouin suggested that given that the patient is on hemodialysis ,the sotalol should be reduced to 40 mg three times a week to begiven approximately two hours after dialysis. The plan was tomonitor the QT interval and discontinue sotalol as a QT intervalor if the QTC were greater than 500 msecs. A QTC was monitoredduring this hospitalization and never exceeded 500 msecs.Therefore , the sotalol should be continued at this dose ondialysis days.B. Ischemia: He is much ruled out for MI. He was maintained onaspirin , statin , and a beta-blocker.C. Pump: The patient was volume overloaded on admission andimproved after significant volume reduction by hemodialysis. Areview of the patient's prior cardiac echoes showed that in9/30 he had an ejection fraction of approximately 70%. In2/19 , his ejection fraction fell to about 45 to 50%. Onrepeat echocardiogram during this admission , a repeatechocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of about 30 to 35%with a mildly dilated left ventricle , moderately reduced leftventricular function. Akinesis in the entire apex of the basalseptum segment and the basal posterior segment of the heart andhypokinesis in the anterior wall , the anterior lateral wall , theinferior wall , and the mid anterior septum segment. There ismild mitral regurgitation. No tricuspid regurgitation and traceaortic regurgitation without any significant evidence of aorticstenosis.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.

PASTMEDICAL HISTORY revealed the patient was diagnosed with dilatedcardiomyopathy in 10-89. She was worked up at the Ingvid's Health Services with a conclusion of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ,work-up unavailable. The patient was discharged on Lasix , digoxinand an ACE inhibitor. In 15 of April , the patient was admitted to Orecross Medical Center after complaining of positional chest pain ,shortness of breath and fatigue. She was diagnosed with dilatedcardiomyopathy and received an echocardiogram , which revealed largeventricles , 2+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid regurgitation. In23 of June , the patient underwent a bicycle exercise tolerance test andendured 10 minutes and 16 seconds , limited by fatigue. Peak heartrate was 104 , peak blood pressure was 156/80 , she had a few atrialpremature beats and no ischemic ST-T changes. Her oxygen uptakewas 16.2 milliliters per kilogram per minute. In 24 of November , the patientunderwent right ventriculogram which showed ejection fraction 24%and global hypokinesis. On the day of admission , on 11 of January , thepatient complained of 4 days of diarrhea , nausea , vomiting andmalaise , followed by sharp severe chest pain in the mid chest belowthe left breast radiating to the back , which was relieved by lyingon the left and aggravated by leaning forward or lying on theright , also worsened by deep breathing and cough , and also withventral palpation. The patient claimed that the pain had nevergone away in the past 12 hours , but again was aggravated by certainpositions. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant forcardiomyopathy , hypertension , gastritis , ex-intravenous drug abuserfor 10 years , anemia , and recent crack cocaine use. MEDICATIONS ONADMISSION included Lasix , Enalapril and digoxin. ALLERGIES were noknown drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese black woman in noapparent distress. Blood pressure was162/100 , heart rate 90 , respiratory rate 24 , oxygen saturation 99% ,no pulsus. Eyes were pupils were equal , round , reactive to light ,extraocular movements intact , muddy sclera. Neck was supple ,jugular venous pressure was 8 to 10 centimeters , carotids were 2+bilaterally. Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussionexcept for a few bibasilar crackles. Heart showed normal S1 andS2 , no rubs , distant heart sounds , no murmurs were noted. Abdomenwas obese , soft , normal bowel sounds , she was comfortable with deeppalpation diffusely. Extremities showed no edema. Rectalexamination was guaiac negative. Neurologic examination wasnonfocal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium was 137 , potassium 2.7 , chloride92 , bicarbonate 37 , blood urea nitrogen 7 ,creatinine .9 , glucose 159 , AST 58 , creatinine phosphokinase 641 ,with 23% myocardial bands. White count was 4.6 , hematocrit 31.5 ,platelets 166 , 000 , ESR 60 , prothrombin time 11.3 , partialthromboplastin time 18. Chest x-ray showed a big heart with mildcongestive heart failure. The electrocardiogram showed T-waveinversions in I , II , F , L , V2 through V6 , consistent with a 1990electrocardiogram done when she was complaining of positional chestpain similar to the chest pain she is having now.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with the thought thather history was consistent with pericarditis , butwas also worriesome for ischemia given her elevated creatininephosphokinase with myocardial band fraction of 23 , and her historyof cocaine abuse. Her hospital course was consistent withcontinuation of her pain through the first day of hospitalizationdespite and aggressive anti-ischemic regimen. It was found thathermyocardial band electrophoresis showed no myocardial bandfraction detected , and it was decided that we would shift ourtherapy to a more anti-inflammatory regimen to control herpericarditis. At that time , Indocin was started and the chest painresolved. With the resolution of her chest pain , the T-waveinversions corrected. The patient was transerred to the floor onIndocin 50 milligrams 3 times a day , aspirin , Bactrim , Enalapriland Carafate and remained without chest pain for the next 2 days.She was also seen by the ACE team in consultation about her drugand alcohol problem , and it was decided that she would bedischarged on 21 of January , after arrangement for follow-up with the ACEteam.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ONDISCHARGE included aspirin , Indocin 50 milligrams bymouth 3 times a day , Enalapril 10 milligrams by mouth each day ,Carafate 1 gram by mouth 4 times a day.

The patient wasinitially prepared for a repair in outside hospital that uponreview of the aneurysm extended up to include of the origin of atleast to the left renal artery and this was felt to be asuprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm requiring a retroperitonealapproach. He presents now for surgery.ALLERGIES: Penicillin leading to a rash.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD status post CABG x 4 in 2001 ,hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , gout , GERD , morbid obesity ,status post silent MI in 1980 and 1985 , Meniere's syndrome inleft ear , sleep apnea leading to BiPAP use.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post CABG x 4 in 2001 , status postlaparoscopic cholecystectomy , 2004 , and status post left kneearthroscopy.PREVIOUS STUDIES: PFTs showing an FVC of 3.44 ( 80% predicted ) ,FEV1 of 2.40 ( 83% predicted ) , and an FEV1/FVC of 70 ( 104%predicted ). The patient had an negative stress test on 7/23/01and 6/20/01 and a MIBI , 6/20/01 showing concentric LVH with anEF of approximately 48% , wall motion abnormalities of the septumconsistent with cardiac surgery , no perfusion abnormalities andminimal reversible ischemia at the base of the lateral wall withthe volume affected being small.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 71-year-old male with ahistory of morbid obesity , sleep apnea , CAD status post CABG x 4 ,presenting with abdominal pain and found by CT scan to have 6-cminfrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was taken to theoperating room on 6/28/05 where he underwent an uncomplicatedopen repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm through aretroperitoneal flank approach. The patient tolerated theprocedure well. He left the operating room with an epidural ,Foley , and nasogastric tube to low wall suction. He was admittedovernight to the intensive care unit for a close monitoring ofblood pressure. His blood pressure overnight remained good andthe patient had a negative set of enzymes on postop #0 with a CKof 146 , MB of 1.7 , and troponin less than assay. The patient wastaken up to the surgical intensive care unit intubated. Hereceived 7800 units of crystalloid , 6 units of cell saver , and 2units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively , put out 1200 ccof urine , 175 cc out of the nasogastric tube , with an EBL of 2400cc. He was weaned from the ventilator without difficulty onpostop day #1 and was extubated by the evening on postop day #1.The patient was transferred to the floor. He was out of bed andto chair on postop day #2 with nursing assistance. Diet wasadvanced as tolerated to a low fat , low cholesterol diet. Thepatient initially started on his home Celebrex and othermedications. The epidural was capped on postop day #2 , 10/3/05 .It was removed on 10/5/05 and this is fully discontinued aswell on postop day #3 , 10/5/05 .  The patient's nasogastric tubehad been removed on the morning of postop day #1 as well.The patient continued to do well on the floor. He was placed onaspirin and subcutaneous heparin for anticoagulation.

During annual follow up in 9/30 of her heart transplant , acomplex eccentric 80% lesion was noted in the proximal LCx. She wasadmitted in January electively with plans for cardiac cath/PCI/stent.However in the interim period , she had a symptomatic LUE numbness thoughtto be a TIA , concerning for R carotid stenosis.An MRI revealed bilateraltight carotid stenosis. The LCx and Symptomatic R Carotid arteryunderwent cath/stent placement in 6/19 .  However , intervention on herleft internal carotid artery ( though 90% occluded by cath ) was deferreddue to already receiving 2 angiographikc procedures during the 6/19admission. At this time she was tapered off cell-cept and started onrapamycin - in hopes of slowing progression in her coronary disease. Shethen returned to medical attention on 19 of April for catheterization/stentplacement on Left Carotid Artery. During these procedure , a hematomadeveloped at the L femoral access site which was managed with compressionduring the case. FSBS was 384 prior to the procedure and elevated to 547during the procedure ( she received D5W+HCO3 during the procedure. ) Shewas given 10 u regular insulin x 2 and her FSBS declined to 400s. Herpost-procedure course has been complicated by hyperglycemia and hematomaformation with a Hct drop of 30 ` 22.PMH:1.

Total bypass time was 127 minutes and totalcirculatory arrest time was 11 minutes. Intraoperatively , thepatient's aorta was not clamped due to calcifications ,appropriate locations for cannulation and proximals wereidentified with epicardial echocardiogram. The patient wascooled to 20 degrees. Distal anastomoses were done underventricular fibrillatory arrest with brief circulatory arrest.Proximals were done under circulatory arrest. The patient didwell intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident. He wasbrought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm andstable condition. Postoperatively , the patient was initiallyventricularly paced , and started on dopamine which was discontinuedon 8/9/06 .  Thepatient also had rate controlled atrial fibrillation that wastreated with Lopressor andstarted on Coumadin for anticoagulation , he did convert to normalsinus rhythm. He was extubated on 2/10/06 and he did have somepostoperative low urine output , which improved with his dopamineand intravenous Lasix.

He has aright foot dressing and is in a boot. Neurologically: Hiscranial nerves are intact bilaterally. His upper extremitystrength is 5/5.PERTINENT LABS UPON PRESENTATION:K 3.7 , BUN 30 , creatinine 1.4 , and sugar 117. CBC 11.3 , 30.6 ,and 421. INR 2.2. Cardiac enzymes: CK 21 , CK-MB 1.4 , troponinless than assay. Digoxin level 1.1. UA normal.IMAGING:Chest x-ray increased vascular congestion. EKG , left ventricularhypertrophy , AFib , digitalis changes.ASSESSMENT:An 80-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease ,AFib , peripheral vascular disease , gout in the setting of CHFexacerbation.HOSPITAL COURSE:The patient was subsequently admitted to the Medicine Servicewhere he was cared for until 1/15/06 .  During this time , thepatient's lasix was increased to 80 mg IV q.a.m. an attempt todiurese the patient with a goal I/O of negative 1 liter aday. He was continued on his digoxin and metoprolol. He wasruled out for cardiac event with three negative sets of cardiacenzymes. He was started on a bowel regimen of Colace , Senna andMiraLax p.r.n. due to constipation. Regarding his right kneepain , the Rheumatology Service was consulted on 7/10/06 andrecommended two views of his right knee , which were significantfor a small effusion and severe osteoarthritis. RecommendedTylenol , opioids for pain and continued colchicine.Intraarticular steroids were discussed , however , deferred untilafter surgical intervention. A Foley catheter was placed tomonitor his I's and O's closely. He was also started ontamsulosin for his BPH. Regarding his hematologic status , hisCoumadin was initially continued , however , due to a plannedPlastic Surgery intervention , starting on 7/10/06 .  The patientdid receive several doses of p.o. vitamin K preoperatively , whichbrought his INR down to 1.3 prior to surgery. Thus on 1/15/06 ,Mr. Rochat was taken to the operating room for debridement of hisright Achilles ulceration and split thickness skin graft.Postoperatively , he was transferred to the Plastic SurgeryService. On postop day #1 , the Rheumatology Service was againconsulted for persistent right knee pain. They elected at thattime to inject steroids intraarticularly. There was not enoughfluid for aspiration , however.POSTOPERATIVE HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:Neurologically: The patient tolerated p.r.n. Dilaudid. He wascontinued on his doses of Neurontin and Zoloft.Cardiovascularly: He has continued on digoxin and metoprolol forrate control of his atrial fibrillation. He was also continuedon 80 mg daily of Lasix , which was decreased to 40 mg afterrecommendations from the Medicine Service. The patient did havean episode of bradycardia into the 30s on 5/12/06 , which wasbelieved to be secondary to excessive beta blockade. Thus hisLopressor dose was decreased to 25 mg t.i.d.Respiratory: The patient has been saturating well on room airwithout pulmonary complaints.GI: The patient has been tolerating his diet and having bowelmovements.GU: The patient's Foley catheter was removed on 5/12/06 .  Thepatient voided without complication. He has continued histamsulosin.Hematologically: He was placed back on his home dose of Coumadinand his aspirin was restarted. His hematocrit was stablepostoperatively at 27.8 and has continued to be stable and iscurrently 29.4. He has also been maintained on subcutaneousheparin t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis.ID: The patient was started on clindamycin postoperatively forgraft prophylaxis. He has been afebrile and his white count hasbeen normal and is currently 7.8.Endocrine: He has been maintained on Lantus and NovoLog beforemeals and a NovoLog sliding scale , which have been titratedaccording to his blood sugars. His insulin regimen is currently ,Lantus 32 units daily , and NovoLog sliding scale , and NovoLog 4units before meals.Rheumatologically: The patient has been followed by theRheumatology Service for right knee gout. The intraarticularsteroid injection improved his pain minimally and thus theRheumatology Service is currently planning on injection ofSynvisc intraarticularly. The Rheumatology Service alsorecommended a right knee MRI , which was obtained ( showed severe OA , goutychanges ). Regarding his wound , his dressings were takendown on 11/16/06 and his skin graft appeared to be taking well.His donor site is clean , dry , and intact as well and he isreceiving heat lamp treatments daily. Regarding his mobility ,the patient has been limited significantly due to his severeright knee pain. The physical therapist will work with thepatient on 11/16/06 , which is the first day that his skin graftdressings have been taken down.PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE:The patient is alert and oriented x3 in no apparent distresswhile he is resting.

The patient has reported a history ofangina over the past several years which was well controlled bynitroglycerin. In October of 1997 , he was able to exercise 3minutes of the Bruce protocol with maximum heart rate of 79 and ablood pressure of over 80 with no evidence of ischemia on EKG. Anecho at that time was also normal. About a month prior toadmission , the patient began experiencing progressive chest painwhich seemed related to exertion. He described the chest pain asburning and radiating to his neck. The patient has a history ofgastroesophageal reflux , and was referred for EGD , but this testwas postponed until a further workup of the patient's chest pain.At baseline he reports exercise-related chest pain everyday as well asoccasional chest pain at rest relieved by about 3-5 nitroglycerin. Theseepisodes are associated with diaphoresis , shortness of breath , but no nausea orvomiting.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,gastritis , GERD , GI bleed in February of1999 , nephrolithiasis , diabetes , history of atrial fibrillation ,asthma , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Cardizem , Klonopin , aspirin , Prilosec ,Paxil , nitroglycerin , p.r.n. , Azmacort ,albuterol , Mevacor , iron , NPH.ALLERGIES: None known.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile , pulse 71 , blood pressure 107/53 ,satting 97%on room air. Pertinent positiveinclude occasional bilateral wheezes on lung exam. CARDIOVASCULAR:Regular rate , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.NECK: No evidence of JVD and no carotid bruits. ABDOMEN: Benign.EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis , clubbing or edema , and dorsalis pedisand posterior tibialis pulses were 2+ bilaterally. RECTAL:Significant for guaiac-positive dark brown stool.ADMISSION LABORATORY: Significant for hematocrit of 29.4 , with anMCV of 78 , cardiac enzymes were negative onadmission.EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 70. Nosignificant ST or T wave abnormalities.PROCEDURES: Cardiac catheterization status post right coronaryartery stent was performed during the patient'shospital stay. No complications resulted from this procedure.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Cardiovascular. On February , the patient had an exercisetreadmill test Bruce protocol. He exercised for 2 minutes and 30seconds achieving a maximum heart rate of 104 with maximum bloodpressure of 130/90 , however , the test was terminated at lowexercise level for shortness of breath an leg fatigue. No EKGchanges were noted during this test. Since this test was nondiagnostic , thepatient was scheduled for a dobutamine MIBI. This test showed a significantarea of ischemia in the inferior and apical regions of the heart. Anechocardiogram performed also showed an area of hypokinesis in the inferiorregion of the heart. Cardiac catheterization performed on February showed100% occlusion of the LAD and 75% occlusion of the right coronaryartery with stent placement. Prior to stent placement , Mr. Niesborellahad two episodes of chest pain in the hospital which resolved withnitroglycerin. He had no chest pain following stent placement. He also hadtransient episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter.2. Gastrointestinal. Mr. Tangerman was noted to guaiac positive onadmission. He also reported some symptoms consistent withgastroesophageal reflux. While in inpatient , his Prilosec wasincreased at 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. He was followed by GI while ininpatient and it was recommended that he have a repeat EGD andcolonoscopy as an outpatient.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d.p.r.n. wheezing , enteric coated aspirin325 mg p.o. q.d. , Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin NPH 25 unitssubq b.i.d. , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,nitroglycerin p.r.n. chest pain , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,Azmacort 4 puffs inhaled b.i.d. , Paxil 20 mg p.o. q.d. , clopidogrel75 mg p.o. q.d.DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.Dictated By: MAXWELL DYKHOFF , M.D. KO42Attending: VAUGHN YANOSKY , M.D. AM88  CU188/5193Batch: 65998 Index No. OEDC639P0R D: 1/1T: 1/1

DIABETES MELLITUS.2. HYPERTENSION.3. BIPOLAR DISORDER.4. PANIC DISORDER.5. RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.6. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.7. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old man witha medical history as listed above whopresented with 3 weeks of worsening bilateral leg edema. The edemastarted approximately 6 months ago and has worsened over the past 3weeks. He has gained approximately 20 pounds since the summer. InAugust he was seen by his primary care physician and found to befluid overloaded and started on Lasix. Unfortunately he has notresponded to even 180 mg p.o. Lasix q day. Concomitant with theedema he has increased dyspnea on exertion for about 1 1/2 weeks.His ability to exercise is limited by his dyspnea and he can onlyclimb one set of stairs compared to 2 sets about 6 months ago. Hedoes not have symptoms of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnaldyspnea. In April of 2002 his pulmonary function studies revealedobstructive dysfunction and he was started on Combivent inhalerswith good response. He has had 2 episodes of chest pain in September of2002 for which he was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction ,at that time MIBI was negative. He denies any palpitations on thisadmission. His last echocardiogram on September , 2002 showed anejection fraction of approximately 65-70% with mild concentric leftventricular hypertrophy and trace mitral regurgitation. Thepatient is homeless , unemployed and left the Alb Sseveral days prior to admission. He has lived with his friendssince then.PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Blood pressure 180 systolic , jugularvenous pressure at approximately 8 cm.He has a normal pulmonary exam as well as a normal cardiac exam.He has evidence of bilateral pitting edema to his hip.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a urine showing 13 gramsof protein per day.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 62-year-old gentleman with diastolicdysfunction , congestive heart failure ,nephrotic syndrome who has failed oral diuretics. In the hospitalhe had evidence of nephrotic-range proteinuria. He had a negative BNPsuggesting the nephrotic syndrome to be the major cause of his shortnessof breath more than congestive heart failure. Venous insufficiency andstanding on his feet most days were also likely contributors to his pedaledema. Ofnote , this nephrotic syndrome is likely due to long standing diabetes inducednephropathy.1. Cardiology: The plan is to continue enteric coated aspirin 325mg p.o. q day and continue with his Ace inhibitor. The patient wasdiuresed aggressively in the hospital and by the time of dischargehe had been switched from Diltiazem and metoprolol over to labetalol 1200mg b.i.d. He will need Torsemide for diuresis , currently 100 mg qd. The planwill be for him to get daily weights and he will be followed by acongestive heart failure nurse. His weight upon discharge is 129kilograms.2. Respiratory: The patient has no dyspnea or respiratorydistress on discharge. The plan is to continue with his outpatientinhalers.3. Diabetes: The patient has good control on Lantus insulin andwill continue that.4. Peripheral: The patient was fitted for Jobst stockings whichhe should wear to his knee and should be used daily. His edema was greatlyimproved with stockings and adequate diuresis.5. Hematology: The patient has relatively new onset normocytic ormacrocytic anemia which will require an outpatient work up.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day ,Atrovent inhaler 1-2 puffs inhaledq.i.d. , labetalol 1200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lisinopril 30 mg p.o.b.i.d. , torsemide 100 mg p.o. q day , Flovent 110 mcg inhaledb.i.d. , Lamictal 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lantus 46 units subcutaneouslyq.h.s. , Procardia XL 60 mg p.o. q day , potassium chloride slowrelease 10 mEq p.o. q day.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: To the Ton Lake SidenorthaHe will need close follow-up of his pulse , blood pressure , weight ,electrolytes , blood sugars , and medical compliance.Dictated By: JAME OZANE , M.D. MF61Attending: CLIFTON MANFREDONIA , M.D. KG587  IV214/074253Batch: 0268 Index No. C8DA5954ZR D: 11/12/02T: 11/12/02CC: Vitaos Dr. , A Sadown

Thepatient had recently been evaluated on 9/21/99 for cough and wastreated for a pneumonia with levofloxacin.The patient stated that his cough and malaise began approximatelyone week after discharge postoperatively. He stated that his coughwas constant , worsened at night , with some small clear sputum.Denied any hemoptysis or fevers. He also denied sick contacts. Nonausea and vomiting or diarrhea. The patient had also notedincreased leg swelling over the past several weeks. In additionthe patient was complaining of some orthopnea as well as PND.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Coronary artery disease , status postcoronary artery bypass grafting 4/5 ( leftinternal mammary artery to left anterior descending , SVG to PDA , OM[with mitral valve annuloplasty]. 2 ) Diabetes mellitus. 3 )Hypertension.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Enteric coated aspirin , Zantac ,Coumadin , Colace , Niferex , Vasotec andNPH insulin.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married , no alcohol , no smoking.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission. Temperature 97.9 , pulse 111 ,blood pressure 133/86 , room air sat 96percent. General - No acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal , roundand reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Jugularvenous distention 15 centimeters , no lymphadenopathy. Lungsdecreased breath sounds at base with bilaterally crackles on theleft a third of the way up. Cardiovascular - tachycardic , normalS1S2. Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. Extremities 3+ lowerextremity edema to the mid thigh. Venous stasis changes on theshins.

Hospital course by systems:1 ) Cardiovascular. The patient was noted to be in new onsetcongestive heart failure. He was aggressively diuresed. It wasnoted on admission that patient was in atrial flutter with pacingat a rate of approximately 110-120. An electrophysiology consultwas obtained and pacer was interrogated and mode changed to DDIfrom DDD. The patient was loaded on digoxin and subsequentlyspontaneously reverted to normal sinus rhythm.2 ) Pulmonary. The patient was noted to have a persistent pleuraleffusion that was new since the patient's coronary artery bypassgraft one month previous. Although it was suspected that this waslikely secondary to congestive heart failure or perhapspostoperative pleural effusion , etiology was unclear. A pulmonaryconsult was obtained. The patient did undergo adiagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis of 500 cc of fluid. Analysisof the fluid showed a pH of 7.48 , total protein of 4.8 ( serum totalprotein 7.6 ) , LDH of 158 ( serum LDH 228 ) ,glucose 135 , amylase 33 with 600 white blood cells , 6 polys , 0bands , 56 lymphs , 13 monos , 18 macrophages and 7 , 000 red bloodcells. No PMNs were noted. Cytology was still pending at the timeof discharge. Though the pleural effusion did meet criteria for anexudate , this was difficult to interpret in light of the patient'srecent aggressive diuresis. As fluid did not appear to beinspected. A PPD with control was planted which was negative ,however controls were also anergic. Sputum cultures were negative.It was felt that the patient would likely benefit from repeatthoracentesis to remove enough fluid so that subsequently chest CTcould be performed. This was to be pursued as an outpatient.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on 7/27/99 with a homeVNA and physical therapy services for vital signsmonitoring and post coronary artery bypass graft rehab services.FOLLOWUP: The patient was to follow up with Dr. Ladika on 3/5/99in the chest diseases clinic , as well as with Dr.Thayne , his outpatient cardiologist. He was also to be seen inCoumadin clinic.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d.; digoxin0.125 mg q.d.; Lasix 80 mg q.d.; NPHinsulin 20 units q. a.m. , 10 units q. p.m.; Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.;Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.; Coumadin 7.5 mg q.h.s.; Zocor 40 mg q. h.s.; Niferex 150 mg b.i.d.Dictated By: JEREMY FREDERICK , M.D. HA12Attending: ARTHUR DO , M.D. UK23  XA673/2032Batch: 84401 Index No. SATT5V1Q5B D: 9/30/99T: 7/27/99

He had a myocardial infarction in 1996and subsequently had coronary artery bypass grafting also in 1996 withsubsequent occlusion of two grafts. He had four previous stents in nativevessels , had a biventricular ICD placed in 2000 , and he also had a history ofhypertension and hyperlipidemia.He was admitted with increasing signs and symptoms of heart failure and hadgone from class I failure to class IV over the 18 months prior to admission. Hewas noted to have a BNP of 1600 and was being treated for pneumonia onadmission. He was initially evaluated for heart transplantation , but due toclinical deterioration was considered for ventricular assist device. Herequired inotropic support prior to surgery. There is no other surgicalhistory of note.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:As mentioned , also a history of mild polycythemiaand thrombocytopenia.FAMILY / SOCIAL HISTORY:Both parents had coronary artery bypass grafts. He had an80-pack-year cigarette smoking history.DRUG HISTORY:At the time of assessment , he was receiving amiodarone 200 mgthree times a day , digoxin 0.125 mg once daily , aspirin 81 mgonce daily , heparin continuous infusion , Lasix continuousinfusion , dobutamine continuous infusion , milrinone continuousinfusion , spironolactone 25 mg once daily.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Examination revealed a midline sternotomy , respiratory cracklesbilaterally and a pansystolic murmur.HOSPITAL COURSE:On 6/16/06 , he underwent cardiac catheterization which showedcomplete occlusion of OM2 , proximal RCA , proximal LAD , 90%occlusion of the D1 , 100% occlusion of the ramus , 100% occlusionof OM1. His LIMA to LAD graft was patent. He had a completeocclusion of vein graft to RCA , 50% occlusion of vein graft toD2. He was also noted to have pulmonary hypertension with meanPA pressure of 48 mmHg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of33. His cardiac output was 3.5 liters on dobutamine andmilrinone infusions. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fractionof 15% , trivial AI , mild MR , moderate TR. EKG revealed atrialflutter at a rate of 104. Chest x-ray was consistent withcongestive heart failure.On 11/22/06 , he underwent reoperative insertion of a HeartMate left ventricularassist device and tricuspid valvuloplasty. He was unable to toleratechest closure at the end of procedure as his central venouspressure was high.Postoperatively he was coagulopathic and inotrope and nitric oxide dependant.On postoperative day #2 , some progress was made weaning inotropes and onpostoperative day #3 , he had a chest closure with a pericardial patch. He alsounderwent exploratory laparotomy and sustained a VT arrest requiringdiscontinuation of cardioversion. He continued to require nitricoxide in view of high pulmonary vascular resistance. On 6/13/06 , he had afurther episodes of ventricular fibrillation and had multiple electricalcardioversions and required amiodarone and epinephrine. Eventually , heconverted to AV paced rhythm. At this time , he required continued to requiresignificant inotropic support. He subsequently continued to have multipleepisodes of ventricular fibrillation which were converted with his AICD. Atthis stage due to his ongoing hemodynamic instability , he was paralysed withNimbex , and his nitric oxide was increased for ongoing pulmonary hypertension.He continued to be hemodynamically ustable. On postoperative day #5 ,he developed cool and dusky extremities and was started onbivalirudin although at this stage his HIT screen was negative. He also becamefebrile with temperatures to 103. On postoperative days #6 , 7 and 8 , his PApressures slowly began to improve and some slow progress was made weaning hisepinephrine. At this stage , his bilirubin began to increase and he developedsome melanotic stool. He also developed renal failure and bythis stage , his creatinine increased to 2.9. By postoperativeday #9 , his Nimbex and fentanyl infusions were stopped. His PAmean pressure had reduced to less than 30. He became febrilefevers and developed some purulent discharge from the VAD driveline.On postoperative day #12 , he underwent fluoroscopic placement ofa post-pyloric feeding tube and continued to spike temperatures.His bilirubin continued to rise , and his ammonia level had alsorisen. On postoperative day #14 , he continued to be unstablewith deteriorating liver function , ongoing renal failure ,metabolic acidosis , ongoing fevers , hemodynamically instabilityand episodes of ventricular tachycardia. He also had by thisstage developed irreversible loss of fingers and toes. Due tohis unrelenting and deteriorating multisystem organ failure , afamily meeting was held at which the poor prognosis wasdiscussed. The family elected to withdraw all support and on5/23/06 , the AICD was switched off as was the ventilator and theventricular assist device and comfort measures were instituted.Mr. Desilvo died at 7:30 p.m. on 5/23/06 from multiple organfailure secondary to complications of ischemic cardiomyopathy andplacement of ventricular assist device.eScription document: 0-2100988 EMSSten TelDictated By: MIRA , BUDDYAttending: GATTSHALL , BENNETT CRISTOPHERDictation ID 8090452D: 6/10/06T: 6/10/06

Confirmation number is 719231. It was dictated on3/18/05 , therefore this dictation will continue over thehospital course starting on 10/28/05 , at which time , the patientwas transferred to the Step-Down Unit. We began weaning themilrinone drip as well as titrating up on her diltiazem andNeoral. The patient was seen by Speech and Swallow and her dietwas liberalized to thin liquids. She was restarted on herdiuresis. The patient began having positive blood cultures on11/29/05 .  One out of two bottles from 8/23/05 grew outGram-positive cocci , but the patient remained afebrile and herwhite blood cell count was trending down. Further blood cultureswere sent off. Central line was discontinued on 9/3/05 and tipwas sent for culture. Further blood cultures were negative butthe line tip grew out coag-negative Staph. Echocardiogramresults revealed an ejection fraction of 55% , mild mitralregurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation andmoderate pericardial effusion , without evidence of hemodynamiccompromise. The patient underwent a cardiac biopsy on 3/8/05 ,which showed focal healing ischemic injury. Despite all negativecultures , the patient continued on vancomycin , Bactrim ,levofloxacin and Valcyte. Speech and Swallow then startedregular solids and thin liquid. Her medications continued to bemonitored by the Congestive Heart Failure Service. She didbecome slightly hypertensive and they increased her diltiazem.She continued on her antibiotics. There is a PICC line attemptedto be placed on 5/26/05 , however , they were unable to withdraw.Therefore , they would return in the morning to attempt it again.Upper extremity and LENIs were done , which was negative for clot ,except for in the left cephalic. Congestive heart failure peoplethen suggested that maybe it would be best that the patient juststayed in the hospital without getting a PICC line to completeher course of antibiotics. She also was going to need a repeatright heart catheterization and biopsy. Her antibiotic coursewas finished on 6/12/05 .  Only other issue was that the patientwas seen by Ophthalmology and it was recommended that she willneed reading glasses when she is at home. Diabetes managementcontinued to follow the patient and congestive heart failure didas well. She underwent a right heart catheterization as well asbiopsy on 11/16/05 , which demonstrated normal left and rightfilling pressures. They were 6 and 14. The patient was foundsuitable for discharge to home on 11/16/05 .  At the time ofdischarge , Ms. Hawker looked great. Her temperature was 96 ,heart rate was 96 sinus , blood pressure was 110/80. She wassatting 99% on room air.

Acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency.2. Congestive heart failure.3. Diabetes.4. Hypertension.5. History of upper gastrointestinal bleed.CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old gentleman withhistory of COPD , CHF , and stage IV chronic renal insufficiency ,who presented to the emergency room on 8/26/2005 with wheezingand shortness of breath following a three-day prodrome of cough ,congestion , and chills. In the emergency room , the patient wasnoted to have a BNP of 519 and was initially treated with Lasixin the emergency room , and was admitted at that point fordiagnosis of COPD exacerbation in the setting of an upperrespiratory infection in addition to mild congestive heartfailure. The patient was given oral glucocorticoids and frequentbronchodilator therapy was initiated. However , the patient'smental status began to rapidly decline. As he became moresomnolent , he was noted to have an ABG with a pH of 7.16. Thepatient was then transferred to the ICU for hypercarbicrespiratory failure after failing an initial trial of BiPAP.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , requiring at least two priorintubations; congestive heart failure , previously thought to bediastolic with an EF of 50%; diabetes , hypertension , history ofupper GI bleed in 5/20 secondary to an antral ulcer , pneumoniain 7/20 left lower lobe nodule , which is stable on followupCTs; chronic renal insufficiency , thought secondary to diabetesand hypertension.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a former smoker with rare alcoholuse. He lives alone and he is a retired chef.FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of diabetes. Father had congestiveheart failure. Brother has a history of pituitary cancer andanother brother with lymphoma.HOME MEDICATIONS:1. Amiloride 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.2. Clonodine 7.5 mg topically weekly.3.

Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily.9. Calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily.10. Advair.11. Albuterol/Combivent.ALLERGIES: IBUPROFEN WITH WORSENING RENAL FAILURE.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION: Temperature 100.6 , heartrate 88 , respiratory rate 28 , blood pressure 158/90 , andsaturating 99% on 2 L nasal cannula. General: This is apleasant , mildly overweight African-American male visiblywheezing and speaking in short phrases. HEENT: Pupils areequal , round , and reactive to light. Oropharynx is clear. Neck:Supple. No lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular: Tachycardic. Nomurmurs , rubs , or gallops. JVP was increased. Respiratory:Crackles , bibasilar. Notable for diffuse wheezes. Minimal airmovement. Peak flow was measured at 200. Abdomen: Soft ,nontender , and nondistended. Bowel sounds are present.Extremities: Mild clubbing and trace edema bilaterally.LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION: Notable for electrolyte panelwithin normal limits. BUN of 52 , creatinine of 3.3 , and glucoseof 154. BNP was 317. Hemogram showed a white blood cell countof 7.7 , hematocrit 40.6 , and platelets 219. MCV was low at 80.Chest x-ray showed interstitial edema , no infiltrates. EKGshowed no acute changes from prior.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 65-year-old male with history ofCOPD who is admitted for a COPD exacerbation in the setting of alikely viral URI as well as some mild congestive heart failureexacerbation.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Pulmonary: As noted above , thepatient was noted to be having hypercarbic respiratory failurewith an ABG of 7.16/98/89 on 3 L nasal cannula. He was thereforetransferred to the MICU and at that time required intubation.The patient's respiratory status improved and he was extubated on11/5/2005 .  The patient was initially treated with Solu-Medrol ,which was changed to prednisone on 4/20/2005 .  The patient wasnoted to have thick tenacious secretions and there was concernfor possible pneumonia as an underlying flare for the patient'sCOPD. Therefore , the patient was initiated on levofloxacin for a14-day course. The patient had , upon presentation , been noted tobe mildly volume overloaded but this improved with diuresis priorto his MICU stay. In the setting of the patient's intubation ,his pH corrected slowly , but he was still noted to have markedlyelevated partial CO2 pressures. The patient was treated withchest PT as well as Duonebs. Following extubation , the patientwas transferred to the floor and did well. Medications wereadjusted and he was continued on a prednisone taper , Spiriva ,Advair 250/50 Diskus , supplemental oxygen , Duonebs , and albuterolnebulizers as needed. The patient continued to improve , and on9/3/2005 , he was able to ambulate on room air without dyspneaor hypoxia. At this point , we suggest outpatient pulmonaryfunction tests to further evaluate the extent of the patient'sobstructive disease.Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient underwent a negative ruleout MI upon admission. This was obtained due to the newlydecreased EF of 35 to 40% that was noted on echocardiogram uponadmission. The patient has not had any ischemic symptoms;however , this marked decrease is concerning especially includingthe inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis , which is new fromhis prior echocardiogram. The patient was continued on aspirin ,beta-blocker , and statin. An ACE inhibitor was reinitiated whenthe patient's creatinine stabilized. The patient will likelyneed further cardiac risk stratification as an outpatient toinclude an outpatient stress test.Pump: As mentioned , upon admission , the patient was noted tohave mild volume overload. He has a history of diastolicdysfunction with a prior echocardiogram showing an EF of 50%. Asnoted , the most recent echocardiogram obtained during thishospitalization shows an EF of 35% with diffuse globalhypokinesis and inferior posterior wall akinesis. There was milddecreased function of the RV as well , and mild left atrialenlargement and mild right atrial enlargement. The patient isnoted to have relatively stable pulmonary hypertension with a PApressure of 50 plus right atrial pressure.The patient had been diuresed aggressively in the emergency roomand therefore did not require additional diuresis upon transferto the MICU. The patient was initiated on hydralazine andIsordil for afterload reduction. When the patient's creatininestabilized , these were changed back to an ACE inhibitor. Thepatient was continued on a beta-blocker as well. The patient wasrestarted on half of his home dose of Lasix at Lasix 160 mg p.o.daily as of 1/6/2006 when he was noted to be mildlyhypervolemic.In addition , the patient was noted to have significanthypertension. He has had a workup previously for secondarycauses of hypertension , which included a negative MRA in 2004.The patient was continued on a clonodine patch as well asbeta-blocker , ACE inhibitor , and Imdur. The patient's homemedication of hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued , as was theamiloride , which may need to be reinitiated as an outpatient.Rhythm: The patient was noted to have four beats of nonsustainedventricular tachycardia on 11/7/2005 , which resolved withaggressive electrolyte replacement. While in the MICU , thepatient had a single run of 30 beats of nonsustained ventriculartachycardia , which improved with electrolyte replacement.Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and thereforewas continued on a regimen of NPH initially at 20 units b.i.d.The patient was noted to have an episode of hypoglycemia withblood sugars around 40 and therefore the NPH was decreased andthe patient will be discharged on a regimen of 15 units in themorning and 10 units at bedtime.The patient was also noted to have hyperparathyroidism likelyfrom renal disease , therefore secondary versus tertiaryhyperparathyroidism. The patient was therefore continued oncalcitriol.Renal: The patient has stage IV chronic renal insufficiency.Upon admission , the patient was noted to be oliguric. This islikely due to a prerenal state given diuresis on admission andfurther exacerbated by the patient's underlying renal disease.Bladder scan was obtained which only showed 3 mL of urine in thebladder. The patient's urine output increased with afterloadreduction. The patient was noted to have acute-on-chronicrespiratory acidosis with chronic bicarbonate compensation.There was no anion gap. The lactate was measured and was only0.6 in the MICU. Throughout the remainder of thehospitalization , the patient's creatinine continued to improveand was measured at 3.4 on 1/6/2006 .  A renal consult wasobtained during the hospitalization. They did not feel thatthere was any indication for acute renal replacement. Thepatient should continue to have renally dosed meds and continueon a renal diet , including Phoslo. The patient will have closerenal followup within the next few weeks.Hematologic: The patient was noted to have iron deficiencyanemia and was started on ferrous sulfate supplementation. Atthis time , an EPO level is still pending.Infectious Disease: The patient was initiated on levofloxacinfor a 14-day course , which was started on 4/13/2005 , and will becompleted as of 9/11/2006 .  Blood cultures and sputum cultureswere obtained and are negative to date. Influenza/adenovirus/RSVswabs were obtained and were negative.Prophylaxis: The patient received heparin subcutaneous 5000units t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis , and was continued on Pepcid forGI prophylaxis.DISPOSITION: The patient was evaluated by physical therapy andfelt to be at his baseline. He is able to ambulate and maintainhis pulse oxymetry greater than 93%. The patient will bedischarged to home with visiting nurse service.TO DO:1. VNA is to check the patient's blood pressure , oxygensaturation , as well as check weekly electrolytes and creatininelevels and call results to Dr. Loil office at 890-189-0562.The patient is to follow up with Dr. Johanns within the next week ,and at that time , should have his blood pressure meds titrated upas needed. The patient may require increased dose of Lasix andthe amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be resumed as needed.2. The patient should have a cardiology outpatient followupregarding his decreased EF and new wall motion abnormalities.The patient may require stress imaging for further cardiac riskstratification.3. The patient should have renal follow up regarding his chronicrenal insufficiency and future need for hemodialysis.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Continue to take all of your medications ,including the Spiriva and Advair , which replace the Flovent aswell as the prednisone. Follow up with Dr. Lapeyrouse within oneweek. Participate with your visiting nurse services. Seekmedical attention for increased shortness of breath , chest pain ,fever , chills , or any other concerns.

She had noted an increase in her chroniclower extremity edema with increasing pain over the last mothsuch that she has been taking Percocet for the pain. For the twoto three days prior to admission , the patient complained offeeling "weak" and unable to get up out of bed due to fatigue andgeneral malaise. She denies any increasing shortness of breath.She has had no chest pain , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Shealways sleeps with the head of her bed elevated , but generallyhas not noted any problem with lying flat. The patient has hadsome complaint issues with her torsemide in the past due to lackof ability to pay for medications; however , she states she hasbeen taking her medications as directed in the weeks prior toadmission. She has had no cough , no fevers and chills.

ADULT ONSET DIABETES MELLITUS.8. HISTORY OF TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK.9. GOUT.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 48 year old gentlemanwith cardiac risk factors includingdiabetes; adult onset , hypertension , positive family history ,dyslipidemia , and also with a distant tobacco use history and withsevere obesity. The patient has a long history of coronary arterydisease starting in 1989. The patient presented with angina andruled out for a myocardial infarction at that time. In 1991 he hadunstable angina. A catheterization revealed 100% LAD lesionproximally , 60% D-1 , 70% distal left circumflex , and normal rightcoronary artery. PTCA to the LAD was performed with 30% residuallesion. In 1992 the patient had two myocardial infarctions. InFebruary of 1992 a re-catheterization showed an additional lesion ofan OM-2 with 60% complex lesion with a mid LAD total occlusion withright-to-left collaterals and diffuse PDA disease. In February of1992 a repeat catheterization was performed for continued unstableangina and the patient had an 80% left circumflex lesion , a 70%OM-2 , 100% proximal LAD , 70% distal left circumflex , 70% OM-2.Over this time period between 1991 and 1992 , the patient had atotal of four myocardial infarctions including a large anteriorwall myocardial infarction. The patient underwent coronary arterybypass grafting in February of 1992 which was complicated byventricular fibrillation arrest in the postoperative Intensive CareUnit. The patient received a LIMA to the LAD , SVG to the OM-1 andan SVG to the OM-2. The patient had a repeat catheterization inFebruary of 1994 for unstable angina which showed diffuse nativedisease: 100% LAD with right-to-left collaterals , 70% distal leftcircumflex , 100% proximal OM-1 , 100% OM-2 , 50% mid right coronaryartery. The grafts were patent. Since that time the patient hashad minimal chest pain. The patient was seen in the clinic mostrecently in January of 1997 for exertional chest pain. The patientdid well with an increase in his Atenolol dose.On the day of admission today , for this admission , the patientexperienced chest burning at rest while watching TV with noemotional or exertional stress. The pain lasted 40 minutes ,radiating to the jaw with an intensity of 8 out of 10. The patienttook a shower without relief , took five sublingual Nitroglycerintablets without relief. The patient presented to the Emergency Wardwhere his pain was relieved in the Waiting Room. The patient hadno nausea or vomiting , diaphoresis or shortness of breath. Thepatient has had no increasing dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea or PNDrecently; however the patient is not physically active. Of note ,an echocardiogram in 1993 showed an ejection fraction of 40% withapical akinesis and septal hypokinesis.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese , pleasant male inno distress. Vital signs: Temperature97.6 , pulse 88 , blood pressure 127/64 , respirations 18 , oxygensaturation was 95% on room air. JVP was eight centimeters. Therewas a normal S1 and S2. There was a positive S4 , no S3. There wasa 1/6 holosystolic murmur with no radiation. Left basilar crackleswere noted. There was a large abdomen with good peripheral pulses.LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , BUN 18 , creatinine0.8 , CK 370 , MB 9.1 , troponin 0.21. White bloodcell count 13 , 000 , hematocrit 45.7 , platelet count 253 , 000 , INR2.4 , PTT 37.6. The patient's chest x-ray was of poor quality , withno congestive heart failure and mild cardiomegaly , and bibasilaratelectasis. The patient's EKG had a normal sinus rhythm with arate of 75 , Q waves in III and aVF , V1 and V2. ST elevations inIII and aVF of one millimeter , ST depressions and T wave inversionsin I and L , but no changes when compared to the patient's baselineEKG.HOSPITAL COURSE:CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient ruled in for a non-Q wave myocardialinfarction , and given his extensive history ofprevious coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypassgrafting , it was felt most likely that the patient is nowdeveloping an occlusion of his grafted vessels versus occlusion ofhis right coronary system. The patient's peak CK was 370 withpositive MB. The patient was continued on aspirin , Lopressor ,Captopril , Simvastatin , and IV heparin , and Nitropaste slidingscale. The next morning the patient was taken to theCatheterization Lab where the previous native disease was noted ,but additional disease of the RCA with serial mid 90% lesions ,which were stented , a PDA of serial 70 and 90% lesions weredilated. The patient was placed on Ticlid. The patientexperienced no chest pain after the procedure and EKGs had shown nochanges after the procedure. A submax Bruce protocol exercisetreadmill test was negative prior to discharge.ENDOCRINE: The patient has a diagnosis of diabetes and hisMetformin was held before the catheterizationprocedure , and the patient was continued on insulin sliding scaleand his Glyburide without complications.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. qday. 2 ) Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q day. 3 )Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4 ) Nitroglycerin sublingual tabletsq.5 minutes x three; one tablet p.r.n. chest pain. 5 ) Simvastatin20 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6 ) Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 14 days. 7 )Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q day. 8 ) Lisinopril 500 mg p.o. q day. 9 )Coumadin 12.5 mg p.o. q day.The patient is to return to work in three weeks.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY WITH STENTPLACEMENT.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient's condition on discharge wasstable.DISCHARGE DIET: The patient's discharge diet was a low-cholesterollow-fat diet , ADA 1800 calorie diet.COMPLICATIONS: None.FOLLOW-UP PLANS: The patient will follow-up with his primarycardiologist , Dr. Denzel , and internist , Dr.Eddie Lantzy .Dictated By: RENATO MCAUSLAND , M.D. IR1Attending: IRVIN BENJAMIN BASSIN , M.D. JY2  OE964/7246Batch: 77180 Index No. NTRNSI9ETY D: 11/25/98T: 11/25/98

His cardiac risk factorsinclude adult-onset diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia ,hypertension , family history of coronary artery disease , and priormyocardial infarction. In 1982 , he developed exertional anginatreated with Isordil and in 1989 had a stress Thallium test whichshowed mild inferior wall ischemia. In 11/23 he was admitted toTonm Medical Center for unstable angina and ruled out forMI. His unstable angina continued and he was admittedo on 2/25/90for cardiac catheterization to further study his coronary arterydisease. This catheterization showed a 95% left anteriordescending stenosis proximally and 80% distally , 95% proximalocclusion of the right coronary artery , and an 80% occlusion of theposterior descending artery. His cardiac index was 3.7 and it wasdecided to schedule the patient for coronary artery bypass graftingsurgery which he underwent on 3/8/90 .  He had a left internalmammary artery to left anterior descending artery saphenous veingrafts to the posterior descending and diagonal branches. Hiscourse in the ICU was uncomplicated and he was transferred to thefloor on postoperative day #2 , where his course was complicated bya few episodes of symptomatic atrial fibrillation with maintenanceof good blood pressure but some symptoms of lightheadedness anddiaphoresis.DISPOSITION: This was brought under good control with Procainamideand he was discharged on 3/8/90 on Procainamide onegram p.o.q.i.d. and Glipizide 2.5 mg p.o.b.i.d. , and aspirin onceper day.

Congestive heart failure.2. Atrial fibrillation.3. Coronary artery disease.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , this is a 64-year-oldgentleman with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction in1976 with resultant left ventricular aneurysm and congestiveheart failure with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%. Hehas had increasing chest pain with exertion over the lastseveral years , which led to an evaluation for ischemia.Catheterization at the Ville Tionsgon County Hospital in Flint Ent Nyjer showed a 70% leftmain lesion and a previously known 100% LAD , OM and RCA disease.The patient had previously undergone a SPECT thallium scan2/3/06 in Moineslumvale Ri Cons , which showed a large anterior anteroseptalinfarct involving the septum , anterior wall and apical walls thatwere entirely scarred and the lateral wall viabilitywas unclear on that scan. A chest CT performed in October of 2006 showed alarge left ventricular dilation with remodeling and calcified andthinned left ventricular apex. His past history is also notablefor a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia dating backto 1983. He had his first AICD placed in 1990 at Woodtwin Memorial Hospitaland this was replaced at the PMC in 1993 with a rate-sensing lead viathe left subclavian vein , and in 1997 , a CPI mini AICD wasplaced. On presentation on this admission , he did not have ahistory of angina , but did have a history of class III heartfailure with marked limitation of physical activity. He was inatrial fibrillation , which is his baseline rhythm.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As mentioned above , includes also diabeteswith oral treatment only , hypothyroidism , dyslipidemia and gout.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: His past surgical history is notable fora cholecystectomy in 80s and ICD placed via an open chest in1990 , replacement in 1992 and in 1997 , appendectomy , rightinguinal hernia repair in 1986.FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is unremarkable , no historyof coronary artery disease.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has an eight-pack year cigarettesmoking history. He has an alcohol intake of two drinks permonth and the patient was formerly a dentist.ALLERGIES: His allergies include erythromycin giving a rash ,amiodarone with a suspected pulmonary toxicity and elevated LFTs.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:1. Toprol 25 mg p.o. daily.2. Valsartan 80 mg p.o. daily.3. Digoxin 0.125 mg daily.4. Isosorbide 30 mg b.i.d.5. Aspirin 81 mg daily.6. Coumadin 1.5 mg daily.7. Furosemide 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.8. Simvastatin 40 mg daily.9. Coreg 25 mg b.i.d.10. Synthroid 50 mcg daily.11. Allopurinol 100 mg daily.12. Potassium 20 mEq daily.13. Klonopin 0.5 mg b.i.d.14. Glucophage 500 mg b.i.d.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for this gentlemanwho was 5 feet 10 inches and 95 kg in no acute distress. Hisvital signs were temperature of 97.8 , heart rate of 70 , bloodpressure of 122/70 and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. He hadno detectable carotid bruits. Examination of the chest wasnotable for a midline sternotomy scar that was well healed and anirregular rhythm. No murmurs were appreciated. His breathsounds were clear and equal bilaterally. His abdomen was notablefor scars from a previous right cholecystectomy and a left lowerquadrant incision for placement of ICD. There were no masses andthe abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities were withoutscaring or edema and he did not have varicosities present.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: An echocardiogram performed at theBeauton Geson Health Care Services on 9/24/06 showed an ejectionfraction of 25% with mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspidinsufficiency and an AICD wire in the right heart.OPERATION PROCEDURES: On 6/16/06 , the patient underwent amitral valve repair with an Alfieri suture , a CABG x3 with aY-graft saphenous vein; SVG2 connects SVG1 to LVB1 , SVG1 connectsto aorta to OM1 , SVG3 to ramus , a left ventricular aneurysmrepair and epicardial lead placement. The bypass time was 257minutes. The cross-clamp time was 98 minutes.ICU COURSE:1. Neurologic: The patient was brought to the Intensive CareUnit from the operating room on a propofol drip. He wasadequately sedated. Sedation was weaned and he was extubatedwithout incident. The patient's pain was well controlled withp.r.n. Toradol. This was transitioned over to Motrin and he wastaking p.o.s and p.r.n. Morphine. He also was continued on hisown dose of Clonazepam 2.5 mg b.i.d. He was neurologicallyintact throughout the course of his ICU stay and he wastransferred to floor with no focal deficits , moving allextremities and pain that is well controlled.2. Cardiovascular: The patient was brought to the ICU onNeosynephrine , epinephrine and milrinone drips. The milrinone wasinitially given a weaning trial , but his mixed venous oxygensaturations dropped to the high 40s and low 50s and the milrinonewas restarted. The Neosynephrine was the first drip to bediscontinued and the patient remained on milrinone andepinephrine. Both of these were slowly weaned , the epinephrinecoming off first and the milrinone coming off two days prior totransfer out of the ICU. He was in rapid atrial fibrillation andwas initially loaded with digoxin , which did improve the ratetransiently. He continued to have marginal mixed venous oxygensaturation and poor cardiac performance as assessed by cardiacoutput and cardiac index. Postoperatively , he had an intraaorticballoon pump. The intraaortic balloon pump remained in untilpostoperative day# 9 when it was discontinued. Slowly the dripswere weaned. He was started on an afterload reducing agent ,first a drip of sodium nitroprusside , after he had had a trial ofesmolol. The esmolol did improve his rates slightly but did notsignificantly improve his cardiac output or his mixed venousoxygen saturation. He did seem to have improvement with theafterload reducing agent of sodium nitroprusside. His rapidatrial fibrillation remained refractory to medical treatment. Hewas given trial of ibutilide , which did not significantly changehis rate or convert him into sinus rhythm. He was loaded withamiodarone in spite of his prior history of pulmonary and hepatictoxicity with plan to use a short course of amiodarone to improvethe rate. His rate did improve. He remained in atrialfibrillation and did not convert to sinus. On postoperative day8 , he was taken to the operating room and cardiovertedsuccessfully to sinus rhythm. Transesophageal echocardiogramshowed an ejection fraction of 30% and no clots in the atrialventricles. He remained in a sinus rhythm for approximatelythree days until postoperative day 11 when he switched back intoatrial fibrillation that was refractory to ibutilide. Attemptedcardioversion was done the following day , which failed , and heremained in atrial fibrillation on transfer to the floor. Hisrate was better controlled in the 80s to 90s and he was on aregimen of digoxin , afterload-reducing agent Captopril 25 mg q.6h. and low-dose Lopressor 6.25 mg q.i.d. His pulmonary arterycatheter was discontinued prior to transfer to the floor , and ontransfer to the floor , his mixed venous oxygen saturation wasimproved in the high 50s to low 60s.3. Pulmonary: Initially , the patient required BIPAP while inthe Intensive Care Unit. He needed an aggressive diuresis toimprove his pulmonary status but transfer to the floor , he wasdown to 3 L nasal cannula and he was able to ambulate and get outof bed.4. GI: The patient was initially started on clear liquids andwas taking very minimal p.o.'s because he had a significant BIPAPrequirement. As the BIPAP was weaned , his diet was advanced andhe was tolerating a regular diet on transfer to floor. He didhave several episodes of diarrhea. Fecal leukocytes andClostridium difficile were sent and were negative and thediarrhea was resolving on transfer to the floor.5. GU: The patient was aggressively diuresed with a Lasix dripand with Diuril boluses. His creatinine tolerated theaggressively diuresis. His sodium remained low in the 130s andhe was transitioned off the Lasix drip to p.o. Lasix andcontinued to be negative on transfer to the floor.6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes andhypothyroidism. He was maintained on dose of Synthroid initiallyIV. Then , that was transitioned to p.o. when he was toleratingp.o.'s. He was on subcutaneous insulin and his sugars were wellcontrolled. Initially , he was on Portland protocol and was thentransitioned to subcutaneous insulin.7. Heme: The patient was anticoagulated with heparin initiallyfor the intraaortic balloon pump and atrial fibrillation. He didhave a marked drop in his platelets and was positive forheparin-induced thrombocytopenia. He was started on argatrobanand bridged to Coumadin. On transfer to the floor , he remains onargatroban with a goal PTT of 50 to 70 and he is getting Coumadinwith goal INR 2 to 3.8. Infectious Disease: The patient had an elevated while bloodcell count throughout the course of his ICU hospital stay. Hehad the intraaortic balloon pump in place for nine days. He wasseen by ID and his only positive blood culture was acoag-negative staph that was believe to be a contaminant. He wason vancomycin for many days that was not discontinued. He doeshave a history of right knee gout , which did flare while he wasin the Intensive Care Unit and part of his elevated blood cellcount was attributed to that. He was started on colchicine andAllopurinol.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: On transfer to the floor , the patient wason following medications:1. Captopril 25 mg p.o. q.6 h.2. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.i.d.3. Digoxin 0.125 mg daily.4. Lasix 40 mg p.o. t.i.d.5. Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily.6. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.7. Clonazepam 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.8. Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. daily.9. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.10. Regular insulin sliding scale.11. Synthroid 50 mcg p.o. daily.12. Magnesium and potassium scales.13. Ambien 5 mg p.o. at bedtime.14. Nexium 40 mg p.o. daily.15. Lantus 12 units subcutaneously at bedtime.16. Darbepoetin alfa 40 mcg subcutaneous.17.

611169412 | TH | 40069618 | | 2027166 | 4/10/2004 12:00:00 AM | CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 2/10/2004 Report Status: SignedDischarge Date: 6/23/2004ATTENDING: RAYMUNDO RODRIUEZ MDThe patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease with the last FEV1 of 0.42 ,congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately40% , who was transferred from Bradpark Hospital for continuedtreatment for worsening shortness of breath. The patient reportsthat one week prior to her admission to the Daspe I Health ,two days before transfer to the Ordma Medical Center , thepatient felt more dyspneic on exertion. She noted that she ishaving a hard time even getting to the bathroom. Ordinarily , athome , her baseline using 1.5 liters of oxygen at rest , but ableto get around the house and upstairs. She went to Lahorn Mulg Medical Center on Sunday. She reports that she had a dry cough withoutany sputum production. No fever or chills. No sick contacts.No hemoptysis. No runny nose or sore throat. This is differentfrom her usual COPD excerebration , in which it is no longerproceeded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection.In addition , the history reveals that the patient usually usestwo pillows to sleep , but recently had been using two pillowsfolded and felt short of breath if she lay down more than that.She would wakeup in the middle of the night when she was short ofbreath , but there was no change in that symptom over the previousmonths.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has gained 15 pounds in one yearprior to admission. She believes that it was due to previoussteroid use. She also notes that she had some diarrhea that was"like pudding" 1-3 times per day. Not watery , not bloody , andnot black. No recent antibiotic use.ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to aminophyllin. She hashypotension and arrhythmias from that. She has a reaction tobeta-blockers in which she has worsening breathing.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. COPD in August , 2004. The patient had a FEV1 of 0.42 andFVC of 1.95.2. Congestive heart failure , April 2003. An echocardiogramshowed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% , inferiorhypokinesis. The ventricle is normal. There is mild aorticinsufficiency , mild mitral regurgitation , normal atria , andnormal tricuspid valve.3. Cerebrovascular accident.4. Type II diabetes when she takes steroids.5. Hypertension.6. Osteoarthritis.7. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.8. Depression and anxiety.MEDICATIONS: On admission ,1. Advair 250/50 mg.2. Albuterol.3. Atacand 4 mg each day.4. Celexa 60 mg each day.5. Clonazepam 0.5 mg two times a day.6. Coumadin 2.5 mg on Monday and Sunday , and 5 mg on other days.7. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg a day.8. Folate 1 mg a day.9. Fosamax 70 mg per week.10. Lasix 40-60 mg each morning , which the patient had not beentaking because it made her pee too much.11. Atrovent inhaler.12. Ritalin 5 mg every morning and at lunch , although she doesnot feel that it was benefiting her.13. Prilosec 20 mg a day.14. Probenecid 250 mg two times a day.15. Tylenol No.3 q.6h. as needed.16. Vioxx 25 mg each day.17. Home oxygen 1.5 liters at rest.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature was 96.4 degreesFahrenheit , heart rate was 120 and regular , blood pressure was142/60 , respiratory rate was 24 , and sating 95% on 2 liters ofnasal cannula. General: The patient was talking 2-3 words at atime. She cannot speak in full sentences. She is usingaccessory muscles for breathing. Her jugular venous pressure waselevated , but with significant respiratory phasic variation. Thepatient's hand veins also revealed an increased venous pressure.The patient had no pallor and no jaundice. Her extraocularmotions were intact. Her pupils were equal and reactive tolight. The patient's oropharynx revealed thrush on the tongue.Chest exam: There were decreased breath sounds. They were softand expiratory wheezes at the bases. No crackles and no rhonchi.Cardiovascularly , the rhythm was regular , tachycardiac , with a1-2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. The abdomen was soft , ,nontender , and nondistended. There were bowel sounds.Extremities: There was no edema , nontender. Symmetricextremities. No clubbing.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband of 43 years.They have no children. The patient has not used tobacco since1984. She has occasional alcohol use. She notes that she drinksone drink every month approximately.At the outside hospital the patient's labs were as follows. Herwhite count was 12 with 75% neutrophils , 3 eosinophils , and 6-12bands forms. Hematocrit was 45. Her platelet count was 290 , 000.Her PTT was 42. Her INR was 2.2. Her Chem-7 and her sodium was139. Her potassium was 4.5. Her chloride 101 and bicarbonatewas 31 and BUN was 20. Her creatine was 1.1. Her glucose was118. Her total protein was 7.7 with an albumin of 4.2 , AST of29 , ALT of 43 , and alkaline phosphatase of 104. Total bilirubinis 0.3. Her pH was 7.38 with the carbon dioxide of 54 and anoxygen of 37 on 20% FiO2 , which is ambient air. This was notedto be an arterial blood gas. Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia at120 beats per minutes. QRS width was approximately 120milliseconds in a left bundle branch pattern with normal axis.No left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage. She had 1-2 mmST-depression in 2 , 3 and AVF with T-wave inversions in thoseleads , also T-wave inversions with 1 mm ST depression in V5 andV6. The only change from the January , 2004 , EKG is that ofT-wave inversion in V5 , otherwise stable.IMPRESSION: At the time of admission , the patient was thought tobe a 60-year-old woman with severe COPD and CHF , who presentedwith worsening shortness of breath consistent with a COPDexcerebration. However , this was unlike many of her previousexacerbations in that she did not experience any upperrespiratory tract infection , and in addition , her jugular venouspressure was elevated , so it was considered that she might behaving a congestive heart failure exacerbation , as well.1. Pulmonary: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation ,with prednisone 60 mg by mouth each morning , Atrovent andalbuterol nebulizers q.4h. and albuterol and Atrovent nebulizersas needed. She was also continued on levofloxacin. Initially ,the patient received 500 mg of levofloxacin a day. As her renalfunction worsened that was changed to 150 mg a day and when herrenal function improved again her levofloxacin was once againincreased to 500 mg a day. This should be continued for a 10-daycourse. There is little concern for pulmonary embolism , giventhe patient's elevated INR. However , she did have a decreased O2saturation and her CO2 was not very elevated at the outsidehospital. A D-dimer was sent which was less than 200 , which isnegative , suggestive very highly for a pulmonary embolism. Thepatient's pulmonary status improved throughout her stay , and byMay , 2004 , she was sating in the 90% range on 2 liters nasalcannula , almost at baseline. It was thought by the physicaltherapy that the patient would benefit from further pulmonaryrehabilitation. As this dictation is being done , the plan is forher either to go to pulmonary rehabilitation or to stay at thehospital until she is fully ready and safe to go home , and is notat an increased fall risk given her severe osteoporosis.2. Cardiovascular:A. Pump: Initially , the patient was thought to possibly bevolume overloaded given the fact that she was not taking herLasix and that her JVP appeared elevated. In addition , there wassome question whether she might has been having increasingparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or at least orthopnea. She wasinitially diuresed aggressively with 60 mg of IV Lasix , twotimes. However , lab results suggested that congestive heartfailure was not a large part of her presentation. First , thebrain natriuretic peptide that was sent , showed a value ofproximally 134 , which is approximately a baseline of 141 ,suggesting that she was not having an acute exacerbation of herheart failure. In addition , the patient's creatinine increasedfrom her outside hospital value of 1.0. When it was firstchecked at 1:00 in the morning on January , 2004 , at Clinchau Hospital , it was 1.7. She received her two doses ofLasix , one on the night of November , 2004 , and then again in themorning of January , 2004. Her creatinine in the afternoon of March , 2004 , increased to 2.2. Urine electrolytes were sent and theacute renal failure workup will be discussed below under therenal section. In terms of her heart failure , the patient wasgiven IV fluids and did not have any further symptoms of heartfailure. Her normal dose of 40 mg of Lasix p.o. every morningwas restarted on September , 2004 , and she will be continued on thatdose.B. Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry and after hersinus tachycardia her heart rate came down as her hyperoxemiaimproved and she had no further issues.C. Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin HMG-COAreductase inhibitor. She was continued on her folic acid , aswell. She was not put on a beta-blocker given her bronchospasticresponse to that , but she was continued on her angiotensinreceptor blocker after her acute renal failure resolved.3. Renal: The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.0from the outside hospital and 1.71 when she first presented. Herbaseline is in the low 1's; 1.0-1.5 as her baseline. The peakcreatinine during her stay was January , 2004 , at 5:00 p.m. and itwas 2.2. Her BUN at that time was 55. Urine electrolytes weresent , which showed a urine sodium of 39 , and creatinine of 137 ,and that was only 12 hours after the patient got her last dose ofLasix. It was felt that the patient had prerenal azotemia andwas given IV fluids. Her creatinine improved , and on May ,2004 , the patient's creatinine was 1.3 , approximately herbaseline. Her BUN at that time was 30 , increased from 23 on April , 2004. The patient will be monitored as an outpatient to makesure that her Lasix dose is not too high.4. Musculoskeletal: The patient's creatine kinase was elevatedon admission to 574. It was rechecked on April , 2004 , and itwas 1967. It was felt that this was due to two factors.Increased release from the muscle , as the patient's MB-fractionwas only 33.5 , which was less than 5% and the troponin wasnegative. So this was felt to be due to her increased work ofbreathing and release from the muscle and exacerbated by heracute renal failure and retention of the creatine kinase. Hercreatine kinase decreased by July , 2004 , to 1195. Therefore ,it was not felt that the patient had rhabdomyolysis causing renalfailure , but rather renal failure causing retention of creatinekinase disease from increased work of breathing.5. Hematology: The patient was continued on her Coumadin. Thepatient's INR throughout her stay remained therapeutic between2.4 and 2.6. On May , 2004 , it was 2.5. She was continued onher home dose. The patient's white blood cell count was elevatedat admission at the outside hospital with a left shift. She wasstarted on levofloxacin and steroids. Therefore , it is difficultto interpret her white count deferential. Her white countremained elevated between 15 and 20 throughout her stay. Herneutrophil count remained between 70 and 78% of that. Aurinalysis was sent , which did not suggest that the patient had aurinary tract infection.6. The patient's TSH was 0.46 with a normal T4 of 7.8. She willbe followed up as an outpatient , as this may representsubclinical hyperthyroidism. In addition to her thyroid , thepatient's osteoporosis was continued to be treated with calciumcarbonate , vitamin D , and Fosamax during her stay.7. Rheumatology: The patient was continued on her probenecid250 mg two times a day. She has no symptoms of gout.8. Psychiatry: The patient was continued on her clonazepam andCelexa. She was not continued on Ritalin and will not bedischarged on her Ritalin given her tachycardia. In addition ,the patient did not feel that the Ritalin was helping her.9. Pain. The patient's Vioxx was discontinued because of herrenal issues. This will also not be one of her dischargemedications and it should be reassessed by her primary caredoctor. The benefits may outweigh the risks , but this should beup to Dr. Satterfield , who has a long-term relationship with thepatient.10. Infectious disease: The patient had blood cultures sent ,which were negative. At admission , in addition , her urinalysisshowed many red blood cells. It did have some white blood cellsand leucocyte esterase. This is most likely just because thepatient had bleeding , secondary to her Foley catheter.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Please use the patient's discharge sheetfor discharge medications.eScription document: 1-0714061 EMSSten TelDictated By: BARUS , BERNARDAttending: WULFF , THADDEUSDictation ID 6384681D: 1/9/04T: 1/9/04

IDIOPATHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.2. ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old woman whohas lived in Tall Dis Thou since 1993.She has a history of chest pain and has a baseline EKG with anintraventricular conduction delay , QRS interval of 0.10. Hercardiac history includes: In February 1988 , she underwent anexercise tolerance test for chest pain. The patient went 7 minutes35 seconds and had a maximum heart rate of 100 , maximum bloodpressure not recorded. She developed a left bundle branch blockwith exercise. A thallium scan showed no evidence of ischemia. InSeptember 1992 , she had an exercise tolerance test for chest pain andshortness of breath. She went 9 minutes 0 seconds and had amaximum heart rate of 167 with maximum blood pressure 138/60. Shedeveloped angina during the test. The SPECT scan showed a moderatefixed defect in the apicolateral wall. In 2/6 , she had an EKGdone which showed normal sinus rhythm with a QRS interval of 0.10and moderate LVH. In 1995 , the patient states that she had acardiac catheterization in Auriend Road , Kane Cho , Mississippi 13286 which showed no coronarydisease , although she was told that she had a cardiomyopathy. Thepatient reports feeling well until the day of admission without anychest pain , shortness of breath , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , ororthopnea in the recent past. On the afternoon of admission , atabout 2 o'clock in the afternoon , she was watching television. Shearose from the couch and went to the kitchen to get a cup ofcoffee. She recalls filling her cup with water , then recallsnothing else until she awoke with her grandchildren lying on halfof her on the floor and crying. The patient was oriented uponawakening and recognized her grandchildren immediately. She didnot have any incontinence or tongue biting. She denied muscleaches , somnolence , confusion , or weakness. She went to the couchto sit down and had nausea and vomiting about five minutes afterher syncopal episode. She also noted a bump on the right side ofher head and subsequently developed a headache. She did not haveany neurologic symptoms , denied any chest pain or shortness ofbreath. She was diaphoretic at the time that she was sitting onthe cough , nauseous and vomiting afterwards. She had nopalpitations and she had no presyncopal sensation or dizziness atany time. She does report having a history of palpitations in thepast , but none on the day of admission. She had no fevers , chills ,or other sick contacts. She had no prior history of syncope orloss of consciousness. She had no history of seizures or transientneurologic symptoms. In addition , she does report that she has ahistory of chest pain. The last time was more than a year prior toadmission. She has no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no pedaledema , no orthopnea , and no change in exercise tolerance recently.She climbs stairs without any problems.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. Chest pain , lastepisode approximately one year prior toadmission. 3. Palpitations. 4. Question of cardiomyopathy ,diagnosed by cardiac catheterization in Sa in 1995.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Vasotec 10 mg p.o. q.day. 2. Digoxin0.25 mg p.o. q.day. 3. Lasix 20 mg q.day.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease , stroke ,diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and sudden death.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient does not smoke , does not drinkalcohol , and does not use IV drugs. She liveswith her daughter in Co Ville at this time of year. She works in anoutreach program as a nurse. She came from Ige Pkwy , Norfsta Olk Mer , New Hampshire 25909 where shehas been since 1993. Prior to that time , she was living in Birhamstonroand receiving medical care at the Cla Du Rencein Hospital .PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs included a blood pressure of130/70 , pulse 62 ( the patient had a bloodpressure of 200/100 when initially seen in the EmergencyDepartment ). She was an elderly woman in no apparent distress.Her HEENT examination was remarkable for having poor dentition.Her JVP was at 8 cm. Her chest was clear. Her cardiovascularexamination revealed an S1 , S2 and intermittent S3 , no murmurs ,with regular rate. Her abdomen was soft and nontender. Herextremities were warm without any cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.Neurological examination was unremarkable. Her mental status wasentirely intact. Cranial nerve examination was grossly intact.Her reflexes were 2+ throughout and her toes did not respond to theBabinski stimulation.LABORATORY DATA: She had a CK of 119 , magnesium 2.2. Her digoxinlevel was 0.7. Troponin I was 0. Electrolyteswere entirely within normal limits , as were BUN and creatinine.White blood cell count was 10.3 , hematocrit 36.5 , and plateletcount 298. Urinalysis revealed 0-1 white cells , 0-1 red cells , 1+bacteria , and 1+ epithelial cells. Chest x-ray revealed noevidence of congestive heart failure or infiltrate. EKG , at thetime of admission , showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 93 withintervals of 0.183 , 0.15 , and 0.417. She had a left bundle branchblock which was new since her 1993 EKG.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for work up of hersyncopal episode. By hospital day one , thepatient underwent a rule out for myocardial infarction. Herenzymes were flat and her EKG showed no changes consistent withacute myocardial infarction. In addition , she underwent anechocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 30%-35%. Shealso had anterolateral wall motion abnormalities. On the followingday , the patient underwent a right sided heart catheterization ,which revealed that her coronary arteries were completely clean.She underwent an EP study which was entirely normal. On thefollowing hospital day , she underwent an exercise tolerance test ,and no arrhythmias were triggered by her exercise. Carotidnoninvasive studies revealed minimal disease bilaterally , and theneurology service was consulted. The patient also underwent a tilttable study , which was entirely normal , with no suggestion of avasovagal response. At the time of discharge , the patient had hadno further symptoms and no further episodes of syncope while inhospital. Her Holter monitor results are pending. The feeling isthat her syncopal event was most likely cardiac related , probablyrelated to a tachycardic arrhythmia. However , her neurologic workup is still underway. She is to have an MRI/MRA as an outpatientand to follow up in DISPAN NI TI HOSPITAL clinic , as well as with Dr. Triche forfurther discussion as to whether AICD placement might be in order.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.day. 2. Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.day. 3.Vasotec 15 mg p.o. q.day. 4. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.day. 5. Atenolol12.5 mg p.o. q.day.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home to follow up inI MINVIC MEDICAL CENTER clinic with me ( Leo Paponetti ) on 4/29/97 .  Shewill have an MRA/MRI of her brain scheduled as an outpatient. Inaddition , she will be set up with an ECG loop recorder for furthermonitoring of events at home.Dictated By: CHADWICK METTA , M.D. BT34Attending: STANTON H.

She had previously declined aortic valve replacement inthe year prior to her admission. She had an echo performed atoutside hospital just prior to admission to Lumca Hospital showed an EF of 55-60% with severe aortic stenosis , anaortic valve area of 0.6 cm square as well as 1+ mitral regurgand 1-2+ tricuspid regurg. She was admitted to the medicalservice at MH where she was aggressively diuresed. She was alsoprepared for urgent aortic valve replacement and possiblecoronary artery bypass grafting. At the time of her admission ,her past medical history included hypertension , peripheralvascular disease , history of stroke with left upper extremitysensory loss , diabetes type 2 , hypothyroidism ,hypercholesterolemia , renal failure with bilateral renal arterystenosis , parkinsonianism , iron-deficiency anemia , vitamin B12deficiency , obstructive sleep apnea , seizure disorder and coloncancer status post resection in 1987. She is unable to elaborateon the details of that resection. She also had renal arterystenting in 2005.ALLERGIES: Stated allergies at the time of admission includedLipitor for which she had myalgias and an erythromycin with areaction of which was unknown.MEDICATIONS: Her admission medications include labetolol 150p.o. daily , amlodipine 5 mg p.o. daily , Isordil 30 mg p.o.t.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , Coumadin 5p.o. daily , Lasix 60 mg twice a day , Colace 100 mg twice a day ,iron sulfate 325 once a day , folic acid 1 mg p.o. once day ,hydralazine 25 mg daily and Synthroid 88 mcg daily as well asDilantin 300 mg p.o. twice a day.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , her physicalexam showed a woman 5 feet 1 inches tall , weighing 94 kilos inobvious mild respiratory distress. Her temperature was 97 and heartrate was 83 and sinus. Her blood pressure in the right arm was120/63 , in the left arm was 109/53. She was on 5L of nasalcannula while satting 99%. The remainder of her physical exam wasnotable only for a loud holosystolic murmur at the right uppersternal border and radiation to her both carotid arteries. HerAllen's test showed severely dampened waveform in both left andright radial arteries. Her chest sounded congested with ralespresent bilaterally and her extremities showed 1-2+ bilaterallower extremity edema. Her carotid , radial and femoral arterieswere all 2+ , but her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial werepresent only by Doppler bilaterally.LABORATORY DATA: Notable lab data at the time of admissionincluded a BUN and creatinine of 79 and 3.1 respectively and abeta natriuretic peptide of 39 , 085. Cardiac catheterization performed on9/10/06 showed 60% lesion of the ostial LAD as well as an 80% proximal LADlesion. She also had 90% ostial D1 and a 40% ostial OM1 lesion and rightdominant circulation. Her echo on 5/26/06 showed an ejection fraction of60% , severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 60 mmHg and apeak gradient of 99 mmHg. Again her calculated valve area is 0.6cm square. Her chest x-ray on 5/26/06 was consistent withcongestive heart failure and appeared very fluid overloaded. Shewas taken on 9/10/06 to the operating room where aortic valvereplacement with aortic root patch was performed , 21 Biocorporcine graft was inserted. She also had a two-vessel coronaryartery bypass grafting using vein to her left anterior descendingand vein grafting to her D1 vessel. She tolerated the procedurerelatively well , but her ensuing ICU course was protracted andvery complicated and will be summarized systematically.Neurologically , the patient suffered no acute complicationspostoperatively; however , her state of consciousness waxed andwaned with her overall condition.From a cardiovascular standpoint , the patient suffered a perioperative MI inthe late hours of 9/10/06 and on to the early hours of 5/17/06 .  She alsowent into atrial fibrillation on postoperative day two andsuffered rhythm abnormalities for the remainder of herpostoperative course. Multiple conversion attempts were madeboth pharmaceutically as well as with electrocardioversion , butshe occasionally did covert to normal sinus rhythm. Ultimately ,she reverted back into atrial fibrillation. The thirdpostoperative day , she became hypotensive and asystolic. Chestcompressions were initiated for less than one minute at whichtime atrial pacing was initiated and her rhythm was regained withadequate blood pressure , though she was returned on to severaldays of active drips to support her blood pressure. From thispoint , Ms. Pavick developed dependence on pressors and inotropicagents to support her blood pressure and cardiovascular system.After several months with no real recovery of her cardiovascularstatus , the family decided to withdraw care and put her oncomfort measures only. She ultimately suffered a cardiac arreston 1/16/07 .From a pulmonary perspective , while she was extubated on the morning ofpostoperative day #2 , she was ultimately reintubated and several pulmonarycomplications required multiple bronchoscopies , multiple thoracentesis on bothchest for recurrent effusions and several chest tubes had to be placed foraforementioned effusions. She was ultimately trached by the thirdweek and although she did occasionally come off the ventilator attimes , she never displayed adequate pulmonary function to be freefrom vent dependence for any length of time.From a GI perspective , with her trach , she underwent a percutaneousendoscopic gastrostomy tube for enteral feeds and at times needed to beplaced on total parenteral nutrition as she only occassionally toleratedtube feeds. She did develop a Clostridium difficile infectionand had to be placed on long-term TPN until resolution of thatinfection.Her renal status at baseline was poor , though she was not on dialysis.Postoperatively , she never recovered any meaningful renal function of her own.She was placed on continuous venovenous hemodialysis by the thirdweek ultimately became anuric , requiring triweekly hemodialysis on Monday ,Wednesday and Friday , a schedule she was managed on until the time of herdeath.From an ID standpoint , she developed many bacteremias and GIinfections as previously discussed. The Infectious Disease Teamwas involved in her care and there recommendations were followedthroughout her hospitalization. For the greater duration of herICU course , she was maintained on vancomycin , levofloxacin andFlagyl on and off for multiple infections.From an endocrine standpoint , she was maintained on her Synthroid dosing andwas on a CZI drip for blood sugar control throughout her ICU course.Hematologically , the patient was transfused many many bloodproducts over the course of her ICU stay. She also developedheparin-induced thrombocytopenia and subsequent clots to her leftlower extremity requiring vascular surgery intervention. She hadembolectomy and thrombectomy of her left common femoral artery aswell as a left common femoral endarterectomy with patchangioplasty on 3/13/06 .  She was maintained on bivalirudin andCoumadin throughout her ICU course.Given her preoperative status and multiple medical comorbidities as well as heroverall poor prognosis through many postsurgical complications , a familymeeting on 10/12/07 resulted in decision to withdraw support and providecomfort measures only. At that time , tube feeds were stopped , hemodialysis wasstoppedand the patient was made comfortable with morphine until herultimate cardiac arrest at 0235 am on 1/16/07 .eScription document: 6-6942755 CSSten TelDictated By: RAMRIREZ , WILBURNAttending: DOBRE , JASPER ELLIOTTDictation ID 2244694D: 1/1/07T: 8/19/07

The patient reports that while he wasaway , he felt as good as he has ever felt , was able to walkgreater than longer distances and over all felt much stronger.However , he states that on Thursday night , he noticed thatinstead of urinating as normal of 4-5 times per night , he wasfound to only urinate 2-3 times. He did not urinate at all onsubsequent days and then put out merely a point of urine on theday prior to admission. He reported that his urinary stream wasnot the usual strength. He did not report dysuria or sensationof being incomplete voiding. In addition , he noted that hisweight usually fluctuated approximately 4-6 pounds per day , butthat he had gained approximately 12 pounds since his oliguriapresented. He notes that his legs are swollen more than usualand he denies chest pain , palpitations , or shortness or breath.MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's medical history is notable forCAD , status post CABG , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , CHF ,obstructive sleep apnea , insulin-dependent diabetes and a hiatalhernia.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , his vital signs werestable with a temperature of 95.8 , heart rate of 60 , bloodpressure 90/50 and saturating 99% on room air. The patient wasan obese male. He was normocephalic and atraumatic with equal ,round and reactive pupils. His hearing and vision were grosslyintact. His neck exam was significant for JVD of 8 cm. He hadno carotid bruits. His pulmonary exam was clear to auscultationbilaterally. He had a normal PMI. No right ventricular heave.His rate and rhythm were normal. He had a normal S1 and S2.Midsystolic and holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex 3 outof 6. His abdomen was notable for multiple abdominal scars and alarge abdominal hernia. He had positive bowel sounds. Hisabdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities were significantfor 1-2+ pitting edema to ankles. There was no erythema , warmth ,or calf tenderness. His neurologic exam was nonfocal.His significant labs on admission was hyponatremia , sodium of 130and potassium of 2.9. A creatinine of 3.0 , BUN of 99 and aglucose of 80. His white cells were 9.7. His hematocrit was36.0. His platelet count was 212 , 000. His UA was negative. Hisrenal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis. No obstruction and aleft renal cyst. His chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly. Noeffusions or no evidence of pneumonia.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:Renal. The patient's presentation consistent with acute onchronic renal failure , which was attributed to low-effectivearterial blood volume and extensive cardiac history notable fordiastolic heart failure in addition to hypertension ,atherosclerosis , most likely contributed to his chronic kidneydisease with a baseline creatinine in October 2005 of 1.6. Hewas initially aggressively treated with diuresis with IVfurosemide on admission. His ACE inhibitor was held due toincreased renal perfusion. His urine output increased over hisinitial two days of admission and his weight decreased from 261pounds upon admission to 254 pounds , three days later. Hisbaseline weight prior to this episode of oliguria was 249 pounds.His diurese were held per recommendations of the renal consultteam in order to allow for further decrease in his creatininebefore he was given them again. He continued diurese and beganhis ACE inhibitor therapy prior to discharge.Cardiovascular: During his hospital stay , Mr. Sperandioexperienced multiple episodes of his typical anginal symptoms aswell as a more pronounced episode of 10 out of 10 chest pain onhospital day #3. During each event , the patient was noted tohave no significant EKG changes and his cardiac enzymes werealways negative. He underwent an echocardiographic exam duringthis admission , which was essentially unchanged from his previousecho on October of 2005. His ejection fraction had increased infact to 75%. There was minimal left ventricular hypertrophy. Hewas continued on his regimen of isosorbide mononitrate 240 mgp.o. q.a.m. , which actually was changed from 240 mg q.a.m. to 120mg b.i.d. for more continuous coverage. He also received hishome regimen of aspirin , statins , Plavix and was started onheparin for prophylaxis. In addition , his magnesium andpotassium were repleted as necessary. The patient continued hishome regimen of Lantus , Humalog and Regular Insulin byfingersticks and then self-administering what he needed tocoverage levels. He continued his Synthroid for hypothyroidismand his TSH was within normal limits during this admission. Thepatient's discharge medications included aspirin 325 mg p.o.daily , allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily , Regular Insulin slidingscale , which he self-administers , levothyroxine , sodium 50 mcgp.o. daily , Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d. , Humalog sliding scale , whichhe administers to himself daily , Plavix 75 mg , p.o. daily , Lantus45 units subcu q.p.m. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. daily , nitroglycerinesublinguals p.r.n. for chest pain and Lotrel 5/20 mg p.o. daily ,Imdur 240 mg p.o. daily and Lipitor 40 mg p.o. daily.

Her initial EKG showed .5-1 mm ST depressionsin leads 1 and aVL , 1 mm ST elevations in leads V1 and V2 ,flattened T waves in leads 1 , aVL , V2 , and V3.SUMMARY: This is a 42-year-old morbidly obese female with ahistory of insulin-dependent diabetes mellituscomplicated by BKA on two prior occasions , who was admitted to theMICU with a BKA in the setting of urosepsis and a non-Q-wave MI.HOSPITAL COURSE: Her hospital course by systems is as follows:1. ENDOCRINE: As noted above , the patientpresented with BKA in the setting of urosepsis and a non-Q-wave MI.She was placed on an insulin drip and hydrated with intravenousfluids , with improvement. She was eventually transitioned to NPHwith insulin sliding scale coverage. Despite escalating her doseof NPH up to 65 U subcu b.i.d. on the day of discharge , shecontinued to have elevated blood sugars >200 and required coveragewith insulin sliding scale. This issue will need to be addressedas an outpatient.2. PULMONARY: Posthydration , the patient was noted to haveincreasing respiratory rates and O2 requirements and rales on exam.As her creatinine had improved concurrent with hydration , she wasgently diuresed. An echocardiogram was obtained to assess her leftventricular function in the context of her non-Q-wave MI , which wasnotable for normal left ventricular function , with an EF of 50% ,hypokinesis of the inferior septum , a right ventricle that wasmildly enlarged , with mildly decreased systolic function , normalaortic valve , mild TR , and mild MR , and a pulmonary artery pressureof 39 mm of mercury plus right atrial pressure consistent withpulmonary hypertension and no pericardial effusion. With her bodyhabitus putting her at risk for DVT and PE , an echocardiogram whichshowed evidence of pulmonary hypertension raised the concern for PEbeing responsible for her symptoms of tachypnea and tachycardia. Aspiral CT was obtained that was nondiagnostic secondary to her bodyhabitus. A VQ scan was obtained , which was read as low probabilityfor PE. In addition , she also had negative LENIs. These studiestaken together alleviated the concern of PE or DVT in her. It wasfelt that the patient likely had obstructive sleep apnea secondaryto her body habitus. She was maintained on CPAP during herhospitalization stay; however , the patient informed the treatingteam that she would not be using a CPAP machine once she returnedhome secondary to the inconvenience and discomfort.3. ID: On admission to MICU , given her positive urinalysis , shewas placed on cefotaxime for gram negative coverage. Both herblood cultures and urine cultures grew out E. coli which weresensitive to cefotaxime and gentamycin. As she initially continuedto be febrile and continued to have positive blood cultures , onedose of gentamycin was given for synergy. Subsequently , sheimproved. She remains on IV cefotaxime for the 7-day period thatshe was in the MICU. On transfer to the floor , she was switched top.o. levofloxacin and will take 7 days of p.o. levofloxacin tocomplete a total 14-day course of antibiotics for urosepsis.4. CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient ruled in for a non-Q-wave MI by EKGand enzymes. Her peak CK was 1200 , with a troponin of 1.52. Shewas initially placed on aspirin , heparin , and a beta blocker. Onceher creatinine normalized , an ACE inhibitor was also added.Heparin was discontinued once the concern for PE was alleviated.Her beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated up for a goalsystolic blood pressure of <140 and a pulse of <70. She wastransferred to the floor on hospital day 7 , where she remainedstable. Another guanosine MIBI was obtained , as the patientreported that she would be unable to exercise , given her chroniclow back pain and sciatica. A planar study was done secondary toher body habitus , which revealed a moderate sized area of priormyocardial infarction throughout the mid LAD coronary territory ,with moderate residual peri-infarct ischemia. The CardiologyService did not feel that the degree of this lesion warrantedcatheterization , given the sizable risk of catheterization in her.5. RENAL: On presentation , the patient had a creatinine of 2.1 ,up from her baseline of 1.4. She was felt to have acute renalfailure , secondary dehydration , in the setting of diabeticketoacidosis. She was rehydrated and concurrent with this hercreatinine returned to her baseline and remained stable thereafter.6. GI: On admission to the MICU , the patient was placed on GIprophylaxis with Carafate. Once she was tolerating p.o.'s , she wasplaced on an ADA diet and her Carafate was discontinued prior todischarge. Once transferred to the floor , the patient complainedof diarrhea; however , the nurses did not witness and were unable toobtain a stool sample to check for C. diff toxin. Patient wastreated symptomatically with Imodium p.r.n. diarrhea. Prior todischarge , the patient was counseled by the Nutrition Serviceregarding an appropriate diabetic and coronary artery disease diet.7. PAIN: On admission , the patient was on several pain medicines ,including amitriptyline , Flexeril , and Valium for reported historyof sciatica and low back pain. On this hospitalization , thesemedications were discontinued and she was placed on Neurontin forlikely diabetic neuropathy.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,NPH Humulin insulin 65 U subcu b.i.d. ,human insulin sliding scale: for blood sugars 151-200 give 4 U ,for blood sugars 201-250 give 6 U , for blood sugars 251-300 give 8U , for blood sugars 301-350 give 10 U , Imodium 2 mg p.o. q. 6 hrs.p.r.n. diarrhea , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150one tab sublingual q. 5 min. x 3 p.r.n. chest pain , multivitaminone tab p.o. q.d. , simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Neurontin 600 mgp.o. t.i.d. , levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x 5 days , Toprol XL 400mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.DISPOSITION: Prior to discharge , the patient was evaluated by thephysical therapist , who noted her to walk around thehospital Eldsche St , Lake Corp Ver , Alaska 29176 without significant problems. They felt that shewould be safe to discharge to home and did not need home PT , butagreed that she would benefit from cardiac rehab , for which she wasreferred. Patient was discharged to home on hospital day 9 , withVNA , who will monitor her blood pressure , pulse , and blood sugar ,and contact her PCP with any concerns or questions. She willfollow up with her PCP , Dr. Carmine Guillebeau , at WNDH in one week'stime , and she will follow up with Dr. Sammie Derobertis of cardiologyat Gons Landgilesnyton Dralvail in April .Dictated By: DAMIAN TABISOLA , M.D. XAttending: BRODERICK TURPEN , M.D. CV26  FG399/011428Batch: 62101 Index No. WKKUHG9QRE D: 4/18/01T: 4/18/01

M.D.PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: Acute coronary syndrome.DIAGNOSIS AT DISCHARGE: Includes the following; ST elevationacute myocardial infarction.OTHER DIAGNOSIS AT DISCHARGE: Post-MI pericarditis , muralthrombus , type II diabetes mellitus , colonoscopy with colonpolypectomy in 1991 , hypercholesterolemia , status post umbilicalhernia repair , and questionable hypertension.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Scorzelli is72-year-old female with a history of hypercholesterolemia , typeII diabetes mellitus , past smoking , and questionablehypertension , but no known cardiac disease , who presented to thishospital with vague epigastric pain/chest pain exacerbated bydeep inspiration and on lying flat. The pain persisted for morethan 48 hours , 10/10 in intensity and prevented her from sleepfinally leading to her presentation to the emergency departmenton July , 2005 , where EKG showed Q waves in the anteriorleads with ST elevation in inferior leads II , III , and aVF. Shehad elevated enzymes. Her troponin peaked to 20. A bedsidetransthoracic echo showed anterior wall motion abnormality. Shewas started on aspirin , heparin , Plavix , Integrilin , andLopressor , and the patient was taken to the catheterization labwhere she was found to have a 100% proximal LAD lesion and a hazy90% lesion to the ramus. Two Cypher stents were deployed to theLAD. The procedure is complicated by no-reflow phenomenon. OneCypher stent was placed in the ramus branch. Right heartcatheterization revealed RA of 12 , RV 36/7 , PA 38/18 , and nostep-up in oxygenation in the right heart. The patient wastransferred to the CCU where her chest pain persisted. The painwas positional , increased by deep inspiration and it was felt tobe likely post-MI pericarditis. Her EKG changes persisted , buther enzymes clearly were trending downwards. The diagnosis ofpost-MI pericarditis is consistent with echo findings showingadhesions between the myocardium and pericardium. Anechocardiogram obtained after the percutaneous coronaryintervention showed an LVEF of 35%. The left ventricular sizewas normal. The right ventricle was normal in size and thethickness of the right ventricle was also normal. There was mildtricuspid regurgitation. There was mild pericardial thickeningwith the areas of adhesions at the pericardium near the apex andthere was a trivial pericardial effusion. Also , a mural sessilethrombus was observed near the apex of the heart. Her EKGchanges continued to show ST elevation in lead II , III , aVF , V2through V6 , Q waves in D2 , D3 , and aVF , and she also intermittentright bundle-branch block morphology. She was treated forischemia with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers titrated toachieve a pulse in the 70s to 80s. We did not increase itfurther because of her low ejection fraction she was unlikely totolerate such high doses. She was started on aspirin and Plavix ,which she continued for her myocardial function. She was placedon eplerenone and Lasix to achieve a dry weight estimated to be78 kilograms. This should be her goal weight. She has also beenreceiving captopril , ACE inhibitors , for left ventricularremodeling. Rhythm wise , there has been no arrhythmia noted ontelemetry on which she has been throughout her hospital stay.For her pericarditis , she initially received 650 mg of aspirin 4times a day. She was continued on this , but later the dose wasreduced as other anticoagulants were started. She was giventramadol for her pain with improvement of her pericarditis pain.Given her mural thrombus , she was anticoagulated initially withheparin achieving the therapeutic PTT of 80 secondsapproximately. She was later bridged to Coumadin with a targetINR of 2. A higher INR should be avoided thus to avoidhemopericardium. Endocrine wise , she was treated for herdiabetes with an insulin regimen that consists of Lantus andRegular Insulin. A cardiac MRI was obtained on February , 2005 ,with following findings. She had moderate to global leftventricular dysfunction with basal to distal and anteroseptalakinesis , apical akinesis , and distal inferior dyskinesis. Herestimated EF was 38%. There is full-thickness delayedenhancement of the myocardium indicating a 7th segment , out ofthe total of 17 segments , myocardial infarction. There was alarge area of no-reflow within the myocardial infarction , whichis consistent with microvascular thrombosis. The distal or thefree wall is also hypokinetic raising the possibility of rightventricular involvement from the myocardia l infarction. Aconcentric moderate-sized pericardial effusion with exudativefeatures was also seen. The thickest area of the pericardialeffusion appears to be on the dependent aspect measuring 12 mm inthickness. There is no right ventricular or right atrialcollapse or compression. Renal wise , she had no issues. Hercreatinine was always below 1 , mostly 0.7 or 0.8.DISPOSITION: Her plan for disposition is to go to rehab. Shehas been evaluated by physical therapy.An addendum will be dictated with the current status of thepatient and her discharge medications at the time that she isactually discharged from the hospital.eScription document: 2-5864714 ISSten TelDictated By: PIQUETTE , AVERY SHELDON JAMIEAttending: CARRINO , STEFAN S.Dictation ID 7002690D: 7/9/05T: 7/9/05

The patient wasrunning up and down the steps on the day of admission when hedeveloped an 8/10 substernal chest pain radiating to his leftarm. The patient denies any associated shortness of breath , buthe did note diaphoresis. The pain persisted for about 20minutes. The patient called the EMS but by time he was callingEMS the pain was dissipating. The patient reports no chest painsince his last non-ST elevation MI in 2001. Of note , the patientis a very poor historian and has no recollection of past medicalhistory or medications. In the emergency room , the patient waspresented with the blood pressure of 172/79 , heart rate of 88 ,and was given IV metoprolol and aspirin. The patient's bloodpressure was difficult to control and he received additional IVLopressor , hydralazine , and nitro paste.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Hypertension.2. CAD status post MI in 2001.3.

The patient denies any drug use.FAMILY HISTORY: The patient has a sister with heart disease inher 40s.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital Signs: Temperature97.4 , heart rate 69 , blood pressure 160/70 , respiratory rate 14 ,sating 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula. In general , the patientwas awake , alert , and in no acute distress , but answered thequestions slowly and had an unusual affect. HEENT: Pupils wereequal , round , and reactive to light. Mucous membranes were moistand oropharynx was clear. Neck: JVP less than 10 cm , supple , nolymphadenopathy. Pulmonary exam: Lungs were clear toauscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam revealed normalS1 , S2 with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen was obese ,soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds.Extremities were warm and well perfused without edema. Thepatient had 1+ distal pulses bilaterally. Neurologic examrevealed cranial nerves II-XII were intact. Exam was otherwisenonfocal.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: The basic metabolic panel ( BMP )was notable for BUN and creatinine of 28 and 1.6 , magnesium of1.5. CBC revealed a white count of 7.6 with a hematocrit of 43.6and platelet count 194. Cardiac enzymes were as follows , thepatient initially had a CPK of 84 with an MB fraction of 1.4 , andtroponin level was less than assay. The patient's desat had atotal CK of 88 and a CK-MB of 2.1 and troponin was 0.58. Chestx-ray had no infiltrates , no effusions. EKG revealed normalsinus rhythm with PACs , normal axis intervals , with some T-waveflattening in V5 , V6 , 1 and aVL.IMPRESSION: The patient is a 75-year-old male with known CADstatus post MI in 2001 status post an RCA stent at that time. Itwas thought unlikely that the patient had flow-limiting coronaryartery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Cardiovascular:Ischemia: The patient's chest pain was concerning forflow-limiting coronary artery disease. The patient was continuedon aspirin and loaded with Plavix upon admission. The patientwas anticoagulated with 1 mg/kg doses of Lovenox q.12h. Thepatient was started on a beta-blocker and given 80 mg of Lipitor.The patient underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization onthe day of admission , which showed a right dominant system withno significant left main lesions. The patient did have aproximal 90% LAD lesion as well as a proximal left circumflexlesion estimated to be about 80%. The patient also had midcircumflex lesion that was also estimated at 80%. The rightcoronary artery had a proximal 50% diffuse lesion and a distal40% tubular lesion. Right PDA had a tubular 90% lesion in themid portion as well as a 90% discrete lesion in the proximal PA.As the patient was found to have three-vessel disease and ahistory of diabetes , surgical revascularization was considered.The patient was evaluated by the cardiothoracic surgical servicewho discussed the case at length with the attending cardiologiston service. In the end , it was decided by both the attendingcardiologist and the attending cardiothoracic surgeon in contactwith the patient and his wife that the best option at this timewas for percutaneous intervention as it was thought that thepatient would have significant difficulty postoperatively becauseof his significant dementia. We felt that the patient would havea difficult time with the necessary rehabilitation following CABGand that percutaneous intervention would indeed be the bestoption. Therefore , the patient underwent a repeat cardiaccatheterization. The patient had a Cypher stent placed to themid LAD lesion. The OM2 lesion was also stented with a Cypherstent across the non-diseased ostium of OM1 and then the proximalleft circumflex lesion was also stented with a Cypher stent. Thefinal angiograms during this catheterization showed no residualstenosis or dissection. The plan was for the patient to returnon an outpatient basis for potential percutaneous intervention tothe PDA/PLV and a stenting of the left renal artery which wasfound to be stenotic and likely contributing to the patient'srefractory hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The patientdid well following his percutaneous interventions and he wasdischarged on a regimen including aspirin , Plavix , Toprol , andZocor. The patient will follow up with Dr. Ruud in thenext few weeks for possible repeat percutaneous intervention.Pump: The patient has no history of CHF. An echocardiogramduring this admission revealed moderate concentric LVH with basalanterior septum basal inferior segment hypokinesis. Ejectionfraction was estimated at 60%. The patient remained euvolemicfor the remainder of the admission. The patient was continued onhis dose of ACE inhibitor. The patient has a long history ofrefractory hypertension. The patient's hypertension was likelyexacerbated by a left renal artery stenosis found on his cardiaccatheterization. The patient was continued on his home bloodpressure regimen and additional agents were used as needed tocontrol his blood pressure. The patient was discharged on ablood pressure regimen that include felodipine 10 mg p.o. oncedaily , Toprol-XL 150 p.o. once daily , isosorbide dinitrate 20 mgp.o. q.8h. , and Monopril 40 mg p.o. once daily. Of note , thepatient was on hydrochlorothiazide as an outpatient but this washeld as he recently received multiple doses of IV contrast. Thepatient's hydrochlorothiazide can be restarted by his primarycare physician after ensuring that his creatinine is okay.Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry during thisadmission and had no issues.2. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic kidney diseasewith a baseline creatinine 1.3 to 1.6. The patient receivedMucomyst and sodium bicarbonate. Continue IV fluids in the pericatheterization period. The patient's creatinine remained withinhis baseline range throughout this admission. The creatinine atthe time of discharge was 1.5.3.

The patient's cardiac history dates back to the fallof 1989 when the patient began to experience exertional angina.The patient has been followed for his angina since that time.Currently , the patient experiences angina at the end of most workdays. In light of his young age , he was referred for cardiaccatheterization and probable coronary artery bypass grafting.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent cardiac catheterizationon 6/25/91 .  This showed severe triple vesseldisease with an essentially normal left ventricle. Thus , thepatient was taken to the Operating Room on 6/13/91 .  Under generalendotracheal anesthesia , the patient underwent coronary arterybypass grafting times three with bilateral internal mammaryarteries. The left internal mammary was taken to the left anteriordescending and the right internal mammary artery was taken to theright coronary artery. The saphenous vein graft was taken to thefirst obtuse marginal branch. The patient was found to haveextremely pronounced atherosclerosis of his coronary arteries.There were no apparent complications and the patient was taken tothe Intensive Care Unit in stable condition. Postoperatively , thepatient had an entirely smooth postoperative course. He wasmaintained on low molecular weight Dextran for 48 hours for hisendarterectomy. The patient was started on enteric coated aspirinon the first day of his operation. The patient was extubated andall his chest tubes and mediastinal tubes were removed. Thepatient diuresed very well and was started on beta blockers. Thepatient remained in normal sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia forthe entire postoperative course.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition.MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Tenormin , 75 mgpo q day; enteric coated aspirin , one po q day; Carafate , 1 gram poq.i.d.; iron sulfate , 325 mg po q day; Percocet and Colace.VP617/0884DORIAN L.

He also has had multiple surgeries inthe past as well as hyperbaric oxygen and has been refractory tothese treatments. He has had a recent flare in 3/16 and hasbeen treated at Eltham Medical Center .  At that time the wound grewout methicillin resistant staph aureus and e. coli. Theseorganisms have been treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn. However ,an MRI at that time was thought to be consistent withosteomyelitis. The patient presented for treatment of thisissue.Additionally , the patient has had some left shoulder pain and wasadmitted at Otjo Goldtion Hospital on 1/26/2003 . There was concern forsepsis at the sternoclavicular joint or perhaps at theglenohumeral joint. The patient had an MRI at the outsidehospital which is not available to us but was concerning for someabnormal process at the sternoclavicular joint. The patientstates he still has some shoulder pain that localizes to thesternoclavicular joint. This seems to be improving over time.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left heel ulcer and calcanealosteomyelitis , BPH status post TURP in 1984 , insulin diabetesmellitus , hypertension , coronary artery disease status post an MIin 1991 , cataracts.ALLERGIES: To codeine.MEDICATIONS: The patient takes insulin NPH 40 q.a.m. and 30q.p.m. , Humalog 20 in the morning 60 at night , Norvasc 5 once aday , Allopril ( sp? ) 40 once a day , Prilosec 20 once a day , K-Dur10 once a day , Lasix 40 once a day , enteric coated aspirin 80once a day , Protonix 40 once a day , Reglan 5 twice a day , Xanax0.25 q.h.s.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs on admission arestable with a temperature of 98.4.

An MRIwas obtained which was read with a bone radiologist andconsistent with osteomyelitis. The patient was taken fordebridement to the operating room , after preoperative clearanceby the medicine team , for debridement of calcaneal osteomyelitison 7/6/2003 ( see _____ of the procedure ). Postoperatively thepatient was continued on Vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl perthe infectious disease recommendations. The cultures from theprimary debridement ( in which the wound was able to be closed )was methicillin resistant staph aureus.The patient did well inhouse. His wound to the foot was changedwhile inhouse and looked intact , clean and dry without drainage.The drain was removed on postoperative day #4.Regarding the patient's left sternoclavicular joint , CT scan wasobtained which was concerning for infection at thesternoclavicular joint. An MRI was obtained to better image thearea and to determine whether or not there is some involvement ofthe clavicle. On the CT scan there was no obvious collectionamenable to surgical decompression. At the time of thisdictation the MRI was pending.The patient had also had a preoperative consult with the PlasticSurgery team but this was not necessary at the patient's woundwas able to be closed in the OR.

Of note , the patient has been in the ED two daysprior to admission on 3/17/2007 for abdominal pain anddistention , at which time labs were within normal limits ,including no white count , LFTs , but he did have ammonia of 81.Plan was for paracentesis , but the patient refused and he leftAMA before follow up with his GI doctor could be arranged. Hisfamily was unable to contact him on the evening on 6/11/2007 . Afriend was sent and checked him out in the following morning on1/13/2006 and the patient was found alone in his apartment andunresponsive. He was taken to the Charl Lubspi Hospital by EMS on 10/28/2007 , and the patient was tachycardic andfebrile to 100.2 , and only able to open eyes to commands ,otherwise noncommunicative per report. A diagnostic andtherapeutic paracentesis of 4 liters was performed , which wasnegative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. His systolicblood pressure dropped to the 80's post-paracentesis and he hadelevated cardiac enzymes with troponin of 0.49. The patient'scourse at the outside hospital was also complicated by UTI ,status post two days or ciprofloxacin and an acute renal failurein the setting of diuresis ( creatinine rising from 0.8 and 1.5 ).Given the patient's extensive history of cardiac/GI treatment atthe Systems/leaj Memorial Hospital , he was transferred to the Nonwelle Geshall Hospital Of on 4/8/2007 .PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.

Hepatic encephalopathy: On transfer , Mr. Davern is alert andoriented , but still very confused with limited verbalcommunication. Baseline ammonia on 1/26/2007 was 66. He wascontinued on lactulose and rifaximin , which were titrated to agoal to 3-4 bowel movements per day. During his hospitalization ,the patient was noncompliant with lactulose regimen due toconfusion and had two episodes of decreased responsiveness. During theseepisodes , there were no EKG or ABG changes suspicious for ischemia orhypercapnia or hypoxia. Given his agitation , the patient was placed onrestraints after whichhis mental status improved , inflicting a possible voluntary andmetabolic component is decompensation. He was able to contractwith healthcare team as his mental status improved and continuedto be compliant with his regimen. At discharge , he continues tobe alert and oriented , appropriately interactive , and anammonia of 16. Plans were to follow up with Dr. Chhuon forcontinued evaluation of his possible liver transplant andmanagement of his hepatic encephalopathy. He should continue onhis lactulose regimen and rifaximin.2. Ascites: Mr. Angeles 's intake weight was 225 pounds. Heunderwent diagnostic therapeutic paracenteses x4. The first twoand fourth procedures removed 6 liters while the third procedureremoved 1.2 liters. Before and after each tap , the patient wasinfused with IV albumin at 8 g/liter of ascites fluid removed.Analysis of ascites fluid showed a SAAG of 1.4 , 2.7 , 3 , and 2.8respectively , which is consistent with portal hypertension. Theascites fluid was also negative for spontaneous bacterialperitonitis. Following each procedure , Mr. Records remainedhemodynamically stable with blood pressures of 80-90/40-50. Hisblood pressure and weights remained stable followingparacentesis , reflecting limited reaccumulation fluid.Discharge weight is 299.9 pounds. He should continue ondiuretics to maintain his ascites at a reasonable level includingLasix 80 mg p.o. daily and Aldactone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.3. Renal insufficiency: Lasix and Aldactone were initiallystarted on Mr. Selim 's stay at the KVGH , but they werediscontinued after increasing in serum creatinine from baselineof 0.8 to 1.4 at the time of transfer. The patient's renalinsufficiency was likely secondary to hypotension with consequentrenal hypoperfusion. Renal ultrasound at the outside hospitalwas negative. Following transfer , Mr. Dayhoff was given empirichydration challenge with IV normal saline and albumin. He provedresponsive to this treatment with creatinine dropping from 1.4to 1.1. He was restarted on Lasix 20 mg p.o. and Aldactone 50 mgp.o. , and gradually titrated up to a discharge dose of Lasix 80mg p.o. daily and Aldactone 200 mg p.o. daily. His serumcreatinine has remained stable at 0.7 to 0.9. He will follow upwith Dr. Averbeck .4. Hypotension: Mr. Boger had been hypotensive at the outsidehospital following paracentesis with normal saline placement.His regimen of lisinopril and nifedipine were consequently heldand discontinued. Given his systolic blood pressures of 80's to90's , nadolol was also discontinued at the time of transfer.Throughout his current hospitalization , Mr. Veroeven 's bloodpressures have remained stable in the 80-90/40-50.5. Troponin leak: Mr. Swogger 's troponin leak at the outsidehospital is likely due to hypovolemic hypoperfusion. He wascontinued on aspirin , Plavix , and Zocor at the outside hospitalas he has status post stents and CABG. At the time of transfer ,his troponin had decreased from 0.49 to 0.15. He has maintainedon aspirin , Plavix , and Zocor , remained stable and asymptomaticthroughout the stay. A repeat troponin performed on 1/26/2007was less than 0.1 ( less than assay ).6. UTI: Mr. Couvertier had positive urinalysis at the outsidehospital. He was treated with 3-day course of Cipro. Aurinalysis performed during this admission was negative.7. Guaiac-positive stool: Likely secondary to straining ,esophageal , and anorectal varices. The patient's hematocrit hadbeen stable at 35 to 43. At discharge , recommended workup in EGDas an outpatient with Dr. Graniela .8. Contact dermatitis: On hospital day #9 , the patientdeveloped a contact dermatitis on inner aspect of his thighs ,thought to be secondary to his urinary and fecal incontinence.He was treated with topical hydrocortisone and miconazole. Healso developed an infected skin tag on his back , which wastreated with topical bacitracin. These should be continued to betreated at rehab and followed up by his PCP.9. Diabetes mellitus: Throughout his hospitalization , Mr.Lynne blood glucose levels were well controlled withfingerstick showing blood sugars to 100 to 190. The patient'smetformin and Avandia were held and he was started on insulinsliding scale , but required minimal coverage. At discharge fromrehab , he should be restarted on his p.o. regimen of Avandia andmetformin. He will follow up with his PCP , Dr. Orizetti .10. Heme: On admission , INR was 1.7 , likely due to decreasedsynthetic function of his liver. He was given a 3-day course ofvitamin K with a good response. At the time of discharge , the patient'sINR was 1.6.11. Code status: Full code.12. Disposition: To rehab.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , albuterol inhaler two puffs b.i.d.p.r.n. wheezing , bacitracin topical b.i.d. applied to affectedarea , Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , Nexium 40 mgp.o. daily , Advair Diskus 250/50 two puffs inhaler b.i.d. , Lasix80 mg p.o. daily , heparin 5000 units subq q.8 h. , hydrocortisone1% cream topical b.i.d. , applied to affected areas , insulinaspart sliding scale , lactulose 45 mL p.o. t.i.d. , miconazolenitrate 2% powder topical , applied to affected areas b.i.d. ,rifaximin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. , simvastatin 40 mg p.o. at bedtime ,Aldactone 200 mg p.o. daily , and multivitamin one tablet p.o.daily.FOLLOW-UP PLAN:1.

NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA.2. HODGKIN'S DISEASE , STATUS POST MECHLORETHAMINE , VINCRISTINE ,PROCARBAZINE , AND PREDNISONE CHEMOTHERAPY TEN YEARS AGO.3. HYPERTENSION.4. STATUS POST TOTAL ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY.CHIEF COMPLAINT: Three days of shortness of breath.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kayser is an African Americanfemale who is 72 years of age with ahistory of Hodgkin's disease status post MOPP chemotherapy , andmore recently diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for which sheis being treated with CHOP chemotherapy. She was tolerating thechemotherapy without complications until developing symptoms offatigue as well as shortness of breath over a three to four dayperiod prior to admission. In July 1997 , Ms. Vanzile presented tothe Oncology Clinic with a biliary obstruction that was shown to bea peripancreatic mass and a left subclavicular lymph node. Biopsyof the subclavicular lymph node revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ,for which she was treated with CHOP chemotherapy. Given herprevious exposure to Adriamycin for treatment of Hodgkin's diseaseten years previously , the patient's cardiac function was followedand serial echocardiograms over the past six months. The previousthree cycles of CHOP chemotherapy were complicated with aperipancreatic abscess which was treated with intravenous then oralantibiotics with good resolution. She , subsequently , three morecycles of CHOP chemotherapy and was in near complete remission bygallium scan; however , a persistent abdominal mass was stilldetected on Computerized Tomography scan. Her therapy was stoppedafter five cycle of CHOP due to the maximum Adriamycin dose of 460mg/m2. The patient was being restaged and was found to developacute shortness of breath over the weekend , denying any chest pain ,nausea or vomiting , or light-headedness. The patient denies anychanges in her activities except for becoming more tired withexertion and wakening up suddenly the night prior to admissionfeeling short of breath.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , Hodgkin'sdisease , hypertension , and a total abdominalhysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals a well-developed , well-nourishedelderly woman who is able to speak completesentences , but with some difficulty. Her vital signs were a heartrate of 140; respiration rate of 32 to 36. Oxygen saturation of92% on room air and is afebrile. The neck examination revealed ajugular venous pressure of 8 centimeters. No thyromegaly orlymphadenopathy was appreciated. Chest examination revealedbilateral lower lobe rales , no rhonchi or wheezes were appreciated.Coronary examination revealed tachycardic rate and rhythm with apositive S3. The abdomen was benign. There is no edema at thelower extremities.LABORATORY: Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia at 130 ,normal axes and intervals. No ST or T wave changes.Her profile-7 is remarkable for a potassium of 3.3 , otherwiseunremarkable. The patient has an elevated LDH. Cholesterol levelwas 243 and elevated triglyceride level of 197. Complete bloodcount was significant for an elevated white count of 11 , 600;hematocrit of 39.9 with an MCV of 91.2; and platelet count of131 , 000. There was a normal differential of the complete bloodcount. Her coags are also within normal parameters. Theurinalysis was benign.HOSPITAL COURSE: Problem number one is the patient's shortness ofbreath. Given the acute onset of shortness ofbreath and dyspnea upon exertion , causes contributing to the changein pulmonary status included pulmonary embolism , congestive heartfailure , and pneumonia. Of note , the patient's chest x-rayrevealed bilateral pleural effusions. However , the patient wasafebrile. Therefore , our suspicion for pneumonia was low. Thepatient received an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function.The echocardiogram on June , 1997 , revealed a mildly enlargedventricle with moderately decreased systolic function. Estimatedejection fraction was 30%. Global hypokinesis was identified alongwith a marked significant involvement of the apex as well as theanterior septal and inferior regions of the heart. Normal rightventricular systolic function was observed. Also noted is thatthere was a small pericardial effusion with an elevated PA pressureof 36. There was also the existence of mild to moderate mitralregurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation. All of this hadlittle change from the echocardiogram taken on May , 1997 ,which revealed an ejection fraction of 30% to 35% along withhypokinesis and a small pericardial effusion. This was markedlydifferent from the patient's echocardiogram in January 1997 withrevealed an ejection fraction of 67% with normal left ventricularfunction and no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was startedon a Lasix regimen in order to start diuresis with good response tointravenous Lasix. The patient also was less dependent on oxygensupplements , however , the patient still reported episodes ofdyspnea upon minor activity. A cardiology consultation wasobtained to evaluate the deterioration in the patient's cardiacfunction. This deterioration was associated with the toxicity ofAdriamycin. A repeat echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate thepericardial effusion as well as an abnormality identified on theMay , 1997 , echocardiogram consistent with a possible ruptureof one of the chordae tendineae. There was little differencebetween the echocardiogram from May , 1997 , June , 1997 ,and February , 1997. The patient was maintained on a regimen ofLasix as well as Ace inhibitors. Initially , the addition ofionatrope was considered. However , given the patient's history ofpotassium and magnesium wasting , it was decided to add digoxin tothe patient's medical regimen.The patient was also evaluated for the possibility of developing apulmonary embolus. Lower extremity noninvasive examinationsrevealed patent vasculature , but no indication of a lower extremitydeep venous thrombosis. The patient also received a VQ scan whichrevealed a low probability of the presence of a pulmonary embolus.After the obtaining of a VQ scan which was negative , the heparinthat was initially stated upon admission of the patient , wasstopped.The patient was discharged on a regimen of enalapril as well asLasix in order to manage the congestive heart failure. Theetiology of the congestive heart failure was thought to theAdriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient has a history ofa potassium and magnesium wasting. Serial profile-7s were obtainedand potassium and magnesium were regularly supplemented. Thepatient was discharged with a daily regimen of potassium.DISPOSITION: The patient showed marked clinical improvement withdiuresis as well as actively reduction with an Ace inhibitor. Thepatient was warned that she needed to watch her salt intake. Ofnote , the patient was noted not to be compliant with a low-saltdiet. Three days before admission , the patient admitted to havinga Chinese food dinner which may have contributed to the patient'selement of congestive heart failure.The patient was discharged with the following medications: Colace100 mg b.i.d.; Vasotec 10 mg q.d.; Lasix 20 mg q.d.; KCl 10 mEqq.d.; and magnesium gluconate 500 mg q.d.The patient was discharged in stable condition , with followup withDr. Gransberry of Lourdesko Memorial Hospital Oncology.Dictated By: TOD RIGGIO , M.D. EN41Attending: DEWEY N.

Myocardial infarction.2. Ventricular fibrillation arrest.OTHER DIAGNOSES:1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.2. Diabetes type 2.3. Peripheral vascular disease.4. Chronic renal insufficiency.5. Depression.6. Hypercholesterolemia.7. COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ).8. History of GI bleed.9. Obstructive sleep apnea.10. Status post cholecystectomy.11. Status post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valvereplacement.12. History of transfusion reaction.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old malewith coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypassgraft in 1982 , also status post Bjork-Shiley aortic valvereplacement for bicuspid aortic valve , status post redo CABG in1995 with SVG to OM2 and SVG to LAD , who presented to Nalcon Memorial Hospital after developing chest pain unrefractory tonitroglycerin. En route to the ER , he suffered a ventricularfibrillation arrest , was defibrillated x1 with 120 Joules to arhythm of pulseless electrical activity. He then received fluidsand lidocaine bolus and he recovered his pulse and blood pressureand was intubated in the field.Of note , the patient had an AVR Bjork-Shiley and saphenous veingraft to LAD and left circumflex sequential grafting , originalsurgery in 1982. In 1985 , he underwent reoperation withsaphenous vein graft to LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM2. Hehas had multiple admissions to Estatewentlung Lufirm Community Medical Center in the pastyear. In September 2003 , he was admitted with chest pain. He ruled infor a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and was taken to thecatheterization lab. At the cath lab in September 2003 , at Dotonh/ Medical Center he had a left main with a tight ostial lesion.He had saphenous vein graft to LAD , it was patent , saphenous veingraft to OM2 was patent with a tight 95% stenosis proximally inOM2 at the touchdown site inhibiting retrograde profusion. Itwas determined at this point that PCI would be inappropriate. Atthat time and echo showed an EF of 25% with moderate mitralregurgitation and right ventricular systolic pressures of 47. Hewas medically managed on nitrates , an ACE inhibitor ,beta-blocker , digoxin , and Lasix. Per his wife , he had beendoing well since April of 2003 , only sublingual nitrogens onoccasion , but today , on the day of admission he ate lunch withhis son and then developed his typical substernal chest pain , butthis time did not have relief with sublingual nitrogen x 3. Hecalled EMS who arrived at the scene and he had the following codestatus mentioned above with a VF arrest and then a PEA arrest.On arrival to Tonwa Medical Center he had a heart rate of 132 , bloodpressure 89/61 , and respiratory rate 28. He was given normalsaline 2 liters , dopamine drip , Lopressor 5 mg IV push , and hewas paralyzed , at which point it was determined that the patientwould likely need urgent cardiac catheterization for suspectedmyocardial infarction. He was transferred the Specce Health Care Cardiac Cath lab emergently.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Coronary artery disease , status post CABG as noted above; historyof multiple non-Q-wave MIs in 1985 and subsequently history ofdiabetes type 2 , peripheral vascular disease , depression , chronicrenal insufficiency , hypercholesterolemia , COPD , history of GIbleed , peptic ulcer disease , obstructive sleep apnea , atrialfibrillation with rapid ventricular response , status postcholecystectomy , status post aortobifem bypass graft in 1987 ,history of transfusion reaction resulting in hemolysis.ALLERGIES: He has no known medical allergies.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included insulin , Isordil , digoxin ,aspirin , folate , Lasix , Lipitor , lisinopril , metoprolol ,Protonix , and Coumadin.SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a current smoker. He is a retired truckdriver and he is married.FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease anddiabetes.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On presentation to Thara Healthcare , he had a pulse of 70 , blood pressure 87/54. He wasintubated and had a saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. He wasintubated and sedated. His JVP was 12 cm of water. He had aregular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. No murmurs , rubs ,or gallops. He had a mechanical S2. His abdomen was soft ,nontender , and nondistended. Bilateral lower extremities werecool and clammy with 1+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally. He hadecchymosis as a result of his Coumadin use.Initial labs were significant for a glucose of 220 , a CK of 565with an MB of 74 and troponin of 14.0. Hematocrit was 48. HisINR was 1.7. Chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate.EKG with sinus rhythm and a left bundle-branch block with rightaxis deviation. Also with inferior T-wave inversions and 1-mm STelevation in V3 and 1-mm ST depressions in I and O.Echocardiogram previously on 3/3 revealed an EF of 39% withinferior HK and AK , lateral HK , inferoapical DK. He had mild MRand aortic radiant of 27/16. The right ventricular systolicfunction is normal.In summary , the patient is a 60-year-old male with chroniccoronary artery disease , now status post a VF arrest in thesetting of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with isolated STelevation in V3. He was admitted for critical care to theCardiac Intensive Care Unit at Lungken Medical Center .HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was transferredemergently to the cardiac catheterization lab wherecatheterization revealed severe native 3VD and vein graftdisease. His left main is moderately sized with a distal 60%lesion. The mid LAD was proximally occluded after the firstsepta. His left circumference is proximally occluded. Thedistal LAD after vein graft is without significant disease andthe distal OM branch after the vein graft is diffusely diseasedwith focal 99% lesion after the distal anastomosis. Saphenousvein graft to LAD is patent , saphenous vein graft to OM has 99%lesion in distal anastomosis with _____ flow and a tilting diskaortic valve that appears to be functioning normally. Insummary , the patient had what was considered to be anonintervenable coronary artery disease and thus he was admittedfor medical management. He received optimal medical managementfor his acute myocardial infarction including aspirin and Plavix ,statin , beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor as tolerated. His ischemicEKG changes have resolved at the time of transfer out of theCoronary Care Unit and he has been chest pain-free for theremainder of that day. His CK peaked at 1090 on 6/17/03 . Pump:The patient was anticoagulated with heparin for a goal PTT of6084 for his Bjork-Shiley valve. His Coumadin was held in thesetting. He had a TTE on 6/17/03 , which showed a leftventricular ejection fraction of 25% with inferoposterior HK ,left atrial enlargement , mild to moderate MR , and well-seatedAVR. The patient was rapidly weaned off dopamine andNeo-Synephrine during his ICU stay and he was transferred out tothe floor , once he was considered to be euvolemic. Rhythm: Asnoted above , the patient admitted with status post VF arrest. Hewas successfully defibrillated out of that with shock x 1.However , his course was complicated by an episode of atrialfibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to the 160sassociated with hypotension for which he was electivelycardioverted with shock x 1 to normal sinus rhythm after which hewas loaded with a 10-g amio load , and he has remained in normalsinus rhythm since that episode. However , after the patient hadbeen transferred to the floor and was stable , he received asingle lead AICD given his history of dilated cardiomyopathy ,coronary artery disease , and status post VF arrest.Pulmonary: The patient was initially intubated in the CCU forairway protection. He was rapidly weaned on the sedation. Hewas successfully extubated on 1/28/03 . However , his chest x-raywas complicated by left lower lobe infiltrate , which wasconcerning for pneumonia. He ultimately has sputum culture thatgrew out pseudomonas and he has been treated with a 14-day coursefor pseudomonal pneumonia. Please see ID section below for moredetails.Infectious Disease: The patient with hypotension and question ofsepsis , septic physiology on 1/28/03 . He was started on empiriclevofloxacin and Flagyl for question aspiration pneumonia bychest x-ray. He was also given one dose of gentamicin and thencovered his broad into ceftaz , vanc , levo , and Flagyl whileawaiting results. He ultimately had no growth from any bloodcultures , although did have on sputum culture positive forpseudomonas which was sensitive to ceftazidime , but resistant tolevofloxacin. He was ultimately switched over to single agentceftazidime for a total of 14-day course for pseudomonalpneumonia/bronchitis.Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with abaseline creatinine of 1.6 and 2.0. In the Intensive Care Unit ,he had a rise of his creatinine up to a peak of 2.8. At the timeof discharge , he still has slightly elevated creatinine at 2.2 ,although it seems to be normalizing. It is likely that this iscontributed by his Dilaudid received at the time ofcatheterization.Heme: The patient anticoagulated at home with Coumadin and thenduring his hospitalization with unfractionated heparin for hisBjork-Shiley valve with a goal PTT of 60 to 80. At the time ofdischarge , he is being recoumadinized with a goal INR of 2.5 to3.5. Previously , his home dose of Coumadin had been 2 mg p.o.q.d. He will need to have his heparin dripped to 10 unitstherapeutically with PTT 60 to 80 until his INR is therapeutic onCoumadin. Hematology continued the patient also with amacrocytic anemia , currently on folate therapy. At the time ofdischarge , his labs were pending for a B12 level , methylmalonicacid , and homocysteine did need to be followed up while thepatient is at rehab.Endocrine: The patient with diabetes. He was continued on NPHwith a Regular Insulin sliding scale with good control of hissugars. At the time of discharge , he should remain on his NPHwith sliding scale coverage.FEN: The patient was placed on ADA diet and his electrolytes wererepleted p.r.n.Prophylaxis: The patient on therapeutic anticoagulation. He wasalso placed on a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic GERD.Tubes , lines , and drains: The patient had an NG tube for a shorttime during his Intensive Care Unit stay while was intubated forenteral feeding. This was subsequently removed and the patienthas been able to take adequate p.o. intake. However , he has adual lumen peripherally inserted central catheter placed in hisright antecubital fossa on 3/9/03 for intravenous access for IVheparin as well as to continue his 14-day course of ceftazidime.Pertinent labs at the time of discharge include a BUN of 53 ,creatinine of 2.2 , white blood cell count of 11.4 with 73% polys ,20% lymphocytes , 6% monos , 2% eosinophils , and 1% basophils.Hematocrit of 33.3 , which is stable , platelets of 175. His MCVwas 96.8 and his RDW was 18.0. His last PTT was 66.1 and INR was1.3.MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:1.

He had typical chest pain for angina and chest tightnessat peak exercise which was relieved with rest. There were noelectrocardiogram changes. He remained in sinus rhythm. Mibiimages showed a mixed MI in basilar half of the inferior wall in4/20 segments , mild peri-infarct ischemia in 3/20 segments in theright coronary artery territory. He had normal left ventricularfunction , normal left ventricular volume , and global systolic leftventricular function with left ventricular ejection fraction of 55percent , wall motion abnormalities and severe inferior wallhypokinesis and mild septal hypokinesis. Based on the results ofthe exercise tolerance test mibi , the patient underwent cardiaccatheterization on April , 1999 which revealed a normal leftmain , left anterior descending artery with minor irregularities ,left circumflex with 90 percent in-stent restenosis in proximalsegment with a dominant left circumflex , and right coronary arterywith a mid 50 percent lesion. The patient underwent successfulpercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the in-stentrestenosis. He was subsequently continued on aspirin. TheElectrophysiology Service recommended that the patient'sprocainamide be stopped. Of note , the patient's QT interval wasnot prolonged while on procainamide. After the procainamide washeld , the patient underwent electrophysiology study on October ,1999 revealing normal sinus node recovery time , impaired AV nodalconduction , no inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia , and noinducible supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. Thepatient was discharged to home with plans to follow-up with hisprimary cardiologist , perhaps with a Holter or event monitor.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: 1. Aspirin 325 mg q.d. 2.Captopril 75 mg t.i.d. 3. NPH Humulin insulin 18 units q.a.m. and8 units q.p.m. 4. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. 5. VitaminE. 6.

MAROTTI M.D.SERVICE: Cardiology.ADMISSION INFORMATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 83-year-old womanwith a history of coronary artery disease , status post remote IMI( catheterization in 1989 with RCA occlusion ) , diabetes ,hypercholesteremia , hypertension , admitted on 5/1/2005 forchest pain. The patient experienced substernal chest painradiating to her left arm and shoulder while moving sofa. Shehad associated diaphoresis and nausea but no shortness of breath.She took 1 sublingual nitroglycerin and 2 aspirin. She wassubsequently transferred to the emergency department. There , hervital signs were stable. She was found to have new rightbundle-branch block and ST elevations in leads I , aVL , and V2through V6 as well as ST depressions in leads II , III , and aVF.She was treated with 5 sublingual nitroglycerin tablets , aspirin ,heparin , Lopressor , and morphine. She was subsequently taken tothe cardiac catheterization lab , then transferred to the CCU forfurther management.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CVA ( remote ) , CAD ( status post remote IMI;catheterization in 1989 with RCA occlusion ) , diabetes mellitus ,hypercholesteremia , hypertension , diverticulosis , spinalstenosis , disk disease , osteoarthritis , status post total kneereplacement , positive PPD in the past.HOME MEDICATIONS: Medications unknown to patient ( patientreceives care at Tion Medical Center ).ALLERGIES: Tetanus toxoid.ADMISSION EXAM: Pulse 70 , blood pressure 155/77. GeneralAppearance: Well-nourished woman. Neck: JVP 12 cm. Lungs:Right-sided wheezes. Cardiovascular: S1 , S2 regular in the 70s ,2/6 systolic ejection murmur. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,nondistended. Extremities: Right groin hematoma withsuperficial ecchymosis. Extremities warm with 2+ pulses.ADMISSION LABS: White blood cell count 13 , hematocrit 44.8 ,platelets 247 , 000. Coags within normal limits. Sodium 133 ,potassium 4.0 , chloride 97 , CO2 23 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.9 ,glucose 221.Baseline EKG , 2001 , normal sinus rhythm , 82 beats per minute ,first-degree A-V block , Q waves in leads II , III , and aVF.Admission EKG , 5/1/2005 , precatheterization: Normal sinusrhythm , 98 beats per minutes , first-degree A-V block , rightbundle-branch block , Q waves in leads II , III , and aVF , STelevations in leads 1 , aVL , V2 through V6.Admission chest x-ray , mild cardiomegaly , pulmonary vascularengorgement and cephalization.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Anterolateral ST-elevation MI - On5/1/2005 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization whichrevealed 100% stenosis of the LAD , 60% stenosis of the leftcircumflex , 80% stenosis of the first marginal , and 100% stenosisof the RCA , with collateral flow from the LAD to the RCA. HerLAD was stented. She was treated with Integrilin , aspirin ,Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , and Lipitor. Her peak cardiacmarkers were on 8/29/2005 and were as follows: CK 3344 , MB386.4 , troponin I 191.4. Her EKG changes were slow to resolve.Her admission EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm , first-degree A-Vblock , and new right bundle-branch block. On 8/29/2005 , thepatient developed transient complete heart block. Gel pads wereplaced , but the patient regained her native rhythm. A temporarywire was placed. On 4/21/2005 , the temporary wire failed tocapture and was adjusted. On 1/23/2005 , the patient was takenback to the cardiac catheterization lab with the idea ofprecluding any further ischemic triggers to complete heart block.A stent was placed in the first marginal. On 10/4/2005 , earlyin the morning , the patient aroused from bed ( despite bed-restprecautions ). Her temporary wire was apparently dislodged. Thiswire was then pulled. The patient developed chest pain withoutEKG changes. She subsequently developed hypotension. There wasclinical evidence of tamponade including distant heart sounds andcool extremities. The patient was taken emergently to thecardiac catheterization lab. A stat echo performed in thecardiac catheterization lab revealed a large pericardial effusionwith diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right ventricle.A pericardiocentesis was performed for 600 mL of bloody fluid.It was thought that the temporary wire had perforated the rightventricle and that the whole failed on its own. In the cardiaccatheterization lab , the patient developed asystole. A temporarywire was replaced. On 8/3/2005 and 10/22/2005 , echocardiogramshowed no evidence of pericardial effusion reaccumulation. Thepatient's ejection fraction was preserved at 45 to 50%. Therewas evidence of hypokinesis of the apical , inferoseptal , andbasal and mid inferior walls. On 10/22/2005 , the patient'ssecond temporary wire was pulled. The patient remained in hernative rhythm. She had rare runs of asymptomatic NSVT rangingfrom 5 to 11 beats. She was without chest pain or shortness ofbreath for the duration of her hospital stay. It was thoughtthat the patient did not require a permanent pacemaker or AICDplacement at the present time. The patient was discharged onaspirin , Plavix , Toprol , lisinopril , and Lipitor. She had notbeen on a statin previously. Her LFTs will require monitoring.Notably , her fasting lipids included total cholesterol of 136 , anHDL of 38 , an LDL of 98 , and triglycerides of 149.2. PULMONARY: The patient required oxygen by nasal cannuladuring her hospitalization. Status post pericardiocentesis , shewas weaned off oxygen. On the day of discharge , she was able toambulate on room air without desaturating.3. ENDOCRINE: Diabetes mellitus. The patient was on oralantihyperglycemics at home. In-house , she was treated standingLantus as well as Novolog standing and sliding scale q.a.c. Shewas discharged on metformin. She has a normal creatinineclearance.4. HEME: Hematocrit. The patient's hematocrit dropped downfrom the low 40s on admission to the low 30s on discharge. Thisdrop was attributed largely to blood loss ( right groin hematomastatus post 5/1/2005 cardiac catheterization - subsequentlystabilized; and pericardiocentesis on 10/4/2005 ). There was adesire to keep the patient's hematocrit above 30 given her acutecoronary syndrome; however , the patient refused for transfusion.In the days prior to discharge , the patient's hematocritstabilized. If her hematocrit remains low , she might benefitfrom outpatient anemia workup , including iron studies , B12 ,folate , reticulocyte count , and smear.5. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Urinary tract infection. The patientdeveloped a urinary tract infection. Urine culture on 8/29/2005showed greater than 100 , 000 proteus. She was treated initiallywith levofloxacin , then Bactrim. A urine culture from 8/3/2005showed no growth.6. POSTPROCEDURE PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was treatedtransiently with Ancef status post temporary wire placement.Blood cultures on admission were negative. Blood cultures werenot rechecked given that the patient remained afebrile withoutsigns of bacteremia.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mgp.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 ( 0.4 mg ) 1 tab sublingual every5 minutes x3 doses , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily , Plavix 75 mg p.o.daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. daily ,metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to take hermedications as directed , particularly the Plavix. The patientwas instructed to follow up with Dr. Vanbelle in clinic on6/24/2005 and with Dr. Bradly Moerke at the Medwinds Hospital .  She was instructed to call her doctor and presentto the emergency room if she experienced any chest pain ,shortness of breath , palpitations , fainting , or any othersymptoms concerning to her.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with homeservices.eScription document: 1-2429268 HFDictated By: RASAVONG , BARTAttending: AGUEDA , DEWITT J.Dictation ID 6667106D: 1/30/05T: 1/30/05

Shehas a known history of syncope which dates as far back as the late1960s. In 1970 she had an episode of loss of consciousness with 30seconds of generalized tonic convulsions witnessed by her daughter.An EEG at that time showed diffuse theta waves but was nonfocal.The patient was treated with Dilantin for less than a year. In1972 she had another episode of syncope associated withhyperventilation. In 1983 she had yet another episode of syncopeand a 24 hour Holter started after the event showed a heart ratethat went as low as 38 but was not associated with any symptoms. In1987 she had a vasovagal event which was later aggravated when herneighbor gave her a nitroglycerin tablet. Throughout this time shehas had multiple other episodes of syncope. Her last episode wasin 1989 , when she was admitted to the Cardiology Team for workup.Her EKG was unremarkable , 24 hour Holter was normal , anechocardiogram was normal , and she underwent an exercise stresstest which did not show ischemic changes. In October of 1992 , shehad carotid ultrasounds for symptoms of right hand and legnumbness. They did not show significant stenosis. In October of1992 , she was admitted and ruled out for a myocardial infarctionand was started on Isordil and Lopressor empirically but these werelater discontinued. In February of 1992 she had a clinic visit withDr. Ed Ville who is her CALL MEDICAL CENTER doctor. The patient indicatesthat she has stable exertional angina without limitation of dailyactivity , chest pain is relieved with nitroglycerin and her mostrecent episode was last week. She has also been on a stable doseof Micronase for the last couple of years. On the morning ofadmission , the patient awoke and felt fine , and was getting readyto have coffee with her friends upstairs. She was reaching forsomething across the table and suddenly felt a sharp pain in herback and fell unconscious into the chair. Estimated loss ofconsciousness was 6-7 minutes. She awoke confused , did not knowher name and had a little bit of difficulty seeing. It was unclearby her history whether her vision was blurry or whether she feltthat there was a shade across her eyes. She denies any doublevision. Prior to this event she did not experience any prodrome oraura. She also denied chest pain , shortness of breath orpalpitations. There was no loss of bladder or bowel functionduring the event. The patient was given orange juice after theepisode and gradually she regained awareness of her surroundings.Her vital signs were stable. She was brought to Tia Medical Centerfor evaluation. There was a question of upper extremity twitchingby report from observers. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertensiondating at least 10 years back and is presently not requiring anytreatment. She has a history , as mentioned , of recurrent syncopalevents. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with adult onsetdiabetes and has been on a stable dose of Micronase. The patientalso has a history of multiple colonic polyps and in 1983 underwenta left hemicolectomy for multiple polyps. In 1988 she underwent anileal resection for large inflammatory polyps leading to a smallbowel obstruction. She has had a cholecystectomy and anappendectomy in the distant past. The patient also a history ofglaucoma. In 1973 and 1976 she had a right lower extremity DVT ,etiology was unclear. The patient does not smoke , drink or use anydrugs. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION include aspirin one tablet q d ,Questran one pack q d , Micronase 5 mg po q d , Betaxolol eye dropsbid to each eye , Pilocarpine eye drops tid to each eye ,eye drops bid to each eye. The patient receives monthly VitaminB12 injections. She also takes nitroglycerin with chest pain.FAMILY HISTORY is significant for a brother who suffered a strokeat the age of 74. There is also a family history of heart attacks.No family history of gastrointestinal cancer. SOCIAL HISTORY: Thepatient is separated and lives by herself in Hutmill Rd. , Bock Tonlake Son , North Dakota 32472 She haseight children with many grandchildren. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS isnotable for episodes of sweats and nervousness over the last weekwhich she describes as being similar to the hot flashes ofmenopause which she had at age 49. These episodes are occurring afew times a day but do not in any way coincide with her syncopalevents. She is also complaining of right hand and foot numbnesswhich have increased in frequency. The numbness occasionally wakesher up at night. She denies any motor weakness whatsoever.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is an elderly , mildly obese female , inno apparent distress. She was afebrile , witha blood pressure of 126/70 , a heart rate of 60 , and a respiratoryrate of 18. HEENT exam was notable for pinpoint constriction ofher pupils secondary to her glaucoma eyedrops. Her pupils werereactive. Her throat was benign. She had dentures. Her neck wassupple , without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. Chest examrevealed bibasilar , coarse crackles. On cardiac exam she had nojugular venous distention , and carotids were normal without bruits.She had a regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2 , and an occasionalS4. There were no murmurs. Abdominal exam was benign. The patientwas guaiac negative. Extremities were without edema and there wasno calf tenderness. The neurologic exam was entirely nonfocal.LABORATORY DATA: Includes a sodium of 143 , potassium of 4.3 ,chloride of 109 , bicarbonate of 20 , BUN of 21;creatinine was 1.0. The glucose was 160. Her calcium andphosphate were normal. Her hematocrit was 43.4 , her white count6.45 with a normal differential. Her coagulation factors werenormal. Her liver function tests were normal. A chest X rayshowed a calcific aorta but was otherwise clear. C spine X ray andhead CT on admission were also negative. The EKG showed no changesfrom her baseline.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was placed on a cardiac monitor , andher Micronase was held. In fact , her fingerstickglucose went as low as 80 that evening. On day two of admission ,the patient had syncopal event while in house. She was apparentlywalking about after having washed her face and was reaching to pullthe curtain when she began feeling lightheaded. She told the nurseimmediately , who tried to get her on the bed , and the patientcollapsed on the bed , was limp and lost consciousness for about 3-5minutes. She had a systolic blood pressure of 200/105 and a heartrate of 90. There were no changes on the cardiac monitor , and thepatient was noted to maintain a strong pulse at all times. She wasgiven Nitro Paste and 1 amp of D50. Fingerstick glucose was thennoted to be 232. The patient was witnessed to have mild twitchingof her jaw and eyelids and after five minutes , she opened her eyesbut was not able to respond. When asked to give her name , she wasnot able to answer. The confusion subsided over the next couple ofminutes , and the patient was able to respond and was alert andoriented. However , she had no recollection of the event. Furtherworkup included a head MRI , MR angiogram of her vertebrobasilarcirculation , a sleep deprived EEG , a cardiac echo , and a 24 hourHolter. All of the above were negative. We also applied carotidsinus stimulation and she showed no change in heart rate to eitherside. The etiology of her syncopal event is not completely clear.It appears that the patient does have a history of a witnessedseizure but also has had syncopal events consistent with eitherbradycardia or a vasovagal event.DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home with plans for arepeat 24 hour Holter as an outpatient. FOLLOW UP:She will follow up with Dr. Danilo Mcquaid in the THERPLEA HOSPITAL Clinic.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.

He had recently developedbacteremia after a colonoscopy and never felt that he had quiterecovered. He was being treated with atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. atthe time for his coronary artery disease. His wife and son , whoare a nurse and a PA , respectively , felt his pulse and it wasfrequently in the 30s , but was also occasionally normal. Hedecreased his atenolol to 25 mg once a day but his symptomspersisted. He was seen as an outpatient and found to have frequentPVCs on EKG.Over the past few months the patient has also noticed increasedangina , both with and without activity. He has had increaseddifficulty walking up the stairs causing chest pain and shortnessof breath that are relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. Then twodays prior to admission the patient also noticed pain at rest butwas again relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. On the morning ofadmission he felt chest heaviness that woke him up from sleep. Hedid not take any nitroglycerin but his wife told him that he was"gasping for breath". Over the past month he had been seeing hiscardiologist , Dr. Verdun . Because of his shortness of breath hewas started on Lasix for 3-4 days but this also did not relieve hissymptoms. He had Holter monitoring with exercise , going up anddown the stairs , at clinic and this also showed frequent PVCs. Hehad an electrocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 30%.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. He had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1974 and 1982. He hadPCI of his left main coronary artery 6/18 and PTCA andbrachytherapy secondary to in-stent restenosis in April , 2002.Intervention 6/18 his left main was radiated. His bypassvessels are LIMA/LAD , SVG/marginal 1 , LIMA/LAD , SVG/RPDA.2. He had a significant GI bleed secondary to aspirin andPlavix in 2002. His hematocrit went to 17. The patient hasremained on aspirin and Plavix secondary to his coronaryartery disease.3. History of prostate cancer treated with radiation , complicatedby radiation prostatitis.4. Diabetes.5. Status post right carotid endarterectomy. No history of TIAsor strokes.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg; Plavix 75 mg; atenolol 25mg once a day; Isordil 60 mg twice aday; lisinopril 20 mg once a day; Norvasc 5 mg once a day; Lipitor10 mg once a day; gemfibrozil 600 mg twice a day; hydroxyzine 25 mgtwice a day; Glyburide 10 mg twice a day; metformin 1 , 000 mg twicea day; Nexium 40 mg once a day; iron sulfate 300 mg once a day;calcium 1250 twice a day; multivitamin once a day; vitamin E; folicacid; Colace.FAMILY HISTORY: He has several siblings with coronary arterydisease in their 60s.SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a former engineer for Ssand Lare , butstopped working when he was in his 40s because ofhis coronary artery disease. He denies any tobacco , alcohol , ordrug use. He lives with his wife.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Two-pillow orthopnea that is stable , nopalpitations.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 95.1 , heart rate58 , blood pressure 112/50 , breathing 22 ,satting 98% on room air. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact.Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation. JVPwas 10.0 cm with a right carotid endarterectomy scar.CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal S1S2. LUNGS: Clear to auscultationbilaterally. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , positivebowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No lower extremity edema. NEURO:Cranial nerves II-XII intact.LABORATORY DATA: On admission. Sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 ,chloride 104 , bicarb 23 , BUN 35 , creatinine 1.5his baseline is 1.4 , glucose 148 , white count 9.0 , hematocrit 37 ,platelets 297. Liver function tests were within normal limits. CK125 , MB 1.6 , troponin 0.02.Electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block and 2-3 beats ofnormal sinus rhythm interspersed with NSVT.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: Ischemia: It was unclearwhether the patient's worsening chest pain wasfrom progression of his coronary artery disease or whether this wasdemand ischemia from his frequent NSVT. He was ruled out for amyocardial infarction by enzymes but given the persistence of hisarrhythmia , he was taken for catheterization. His catheterizationshowed an LAD 100% lesion , diag 1 80% lesion , left circumflex 100%lesion , the ramus was widely patent , RCA showed a 100% lesion ,right PDA 100% lesion. Overall , his LIMA graft to the LAD waswidely patent , his SVG graft to marginal 1 and SVG graft to RCAwere both occluded but had collaterals. What was new from hisprevious catheterization was disease in his PDA. It was determinedto further treat the patient's coronary artery disease with medicalmanagement. After his heart rate was controlled with amiodaroneand with a pacemaker , he did however continue to have some fatigueand shortness of breath. As a result he had an adenosine MIBI toevaluate for functional ischemia given the findings on hiscatheterization. The MIBI showed a moderate sized perfusion defectthroughout the inferior and basal inferoseptal and inferolateralwalls showing a moderate amount of reversibility. His ejectionfraction was estimated at 50% with akinesis of the inferior andinferoseptal walls with reduced thickening. He did not have anyEKG changes during the procedure. His beta blockade was increasedto Lopressor 50 b.i.d. and he continued on his nitrates. He wasactually able to tolerate ambulation without feeling any pain orshortness of breath. It is possible that the symptoms that he hadlater on in the hospitalization were secondary to volume overloadwhich responded well to diuresis. He will follow up with Dr.Rafi . It is unlikely that any intervention will be able to bedone but he will explore this as an outpatient.2 ) Pump: The patient did experience some shortness of breathseveral days into his admission. He had been approximately fourliters positive over several days. He was given 20 mg of IV Lasixand responded well. He was sent home with 20 mg of Lasix q. Mondayand Thursday.3 ) Rhythm: The patient's electrocardiogram and telemetry stripswere concerning because while he was technically in normal sinusrhythm , he was usually only in normal sinus rhythm for 3-4 beats ata time at most , and in between that , had several runs of NSVT. TheNSVT never progressed to sustained V-TAC and the patient was alwayshemodynamically stable. However , there was concern that this couldultimately progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Hewas loaded on amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. which he toleratedwell. He also required an additional 150 mg IV x 1 load tostabilize his rhythm. He had an ICD and DDI pacemaker placed on7/26 without complication. After the pacemaker was placed he wasstill experiencing some fatigue and it was thought that he may havebeen overpaced. As a result his settings were adjusted to increasehis AV delayed 240 and he was changed to DDD mode. He also had anumber of beats shortened that would be required to detect the VT ,to 24. By the time of discharge his amiodarone was decreased to400 mg q.d. This may ultimately be decreased even further to 200but will be decided by Dr. Swymer .4 ) Endocrinology: The patient has a history of diabetes. We heldhis metformin on admission because of his catheterization butrestarted it upon discharge. Any elevated blood sugars werecovered with an insulin sliding scale.5 ) Pulmonary: As mentioned above the patient did have someshortness of breath which was likely due to volume overload. Heresponded well to 20 mg IV Lasix. He always maintained his oxygensaturations. He will have pulmonary function tests as anoutpatient to establish a baseline given his new treatment withamiodarone.6 ) Heme: The patient does have a history of a GI bleed on aspirinand Plavix. We monitored his hematocrit closely. He came in at37. It did decrease to 31. During his hospitalization he had anepisode of bright red blood per rectum. Given his history ofradiation proctitis and proctatitis it is not surprising that hehad this. He always remained hemodynamically stable and did notrequire any transfusions. At baseline his hematocrit is probablycloser to 33 and it is likely that the 37 was an elevation fromdecreased p.o. intake. Follow up stools were guaiac-negative.FOLLOWUP: He will follow up as an outpatient with Dr. Halvorson andFabus on 4/4/03 . He will also have pulmonaryfunction tests on 5/8 .DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.q.d.; aspirin 81 mgp.o.q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 p.o.b.i.d.; Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; iron sulfate 300 q.d.; folate400 mcg q.d.; gemfibrozil 600 b.i.d.; Glyburide 10 mg b.i.d.;hydroxyzine 25 b.i.d.; lisinopril 20 q.d.; Lopressor 50 b.i.d.;M.V.I. q.d.; vitamin E 1 , 000 units q.d.; Norvasc 5 mg q.d.; Imdur60 b.i.d.; Plavix 75 q.d.; Nexium 40 q.d.; Lipitor 10 q.d.;metformin 1 , 000 b.i.d.; Lasix 20 mg q.

LFTs were within normal limits. Hemogramshowed a mildly depressed hematocrit of 32 , troponin elevated at14.4 , CK 364 , and CKMB 28.3. EKG upon admission showed normalsinus rhythm at 83 , normal axis , ST depressions noted in leads IIV5 , and V6. No ST elevations. Q waves in III and F. T waveinversions noted in I through III , F , V6 , poor R-waveprogression.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 61-year-old female with a historyof multiple vasculopathies , who presented with a non-ST elevationMI. The patient was noted to have markedly elevated troponin andprogressive T-wave inversions laterally.1. Cardiovascular ischemia , following admission , the patient wasinitiated on aspirin , Plavix , nitroglycerin drip , oxygen p.r.n. ,and the beta-blocker was titrated up as tolerated. ACE inhibitoras well as hydralazine were held. Over the first night ofadmission , the patient noted increasing chest discomfort. Thenitroglycerin was titrated up. EKG showed continued T waveinversions laterally as well as marked increase in troponin up toan elevation of 105. Cardiac fellow was contacted and thepatient was titrated up further on her nitroglycerin to a max of200. The patient did not have chest pain on the night ofadmission , however was noted to have EKG changes and elevatedtroponin as mentioned. On the morning following admission , on11/8/05 , the patient was noted to have new onset of chestdiscomfort and at that time was noted to have ST elevations inher inferior leads III and F as well as V6 and L. At that time ,due to the continued chest discomfort and new ST elevation , thepatient was taken to the cath lab , at which time , she underwent acardiac catheterization and was noted to have a three-vesseldisease status post CABG. She was noted to have 90% of occlusionof the SVG graft to RTPDA status post PDA. These lesions wereintervened upon with drug eluding stents x 3. Following thecatheterization , the patient was continued on her medicalmanagement. She remained chest pain free and the nitroglycerindrip was discontinued. Following the cath , the patient'stroponins trended down and she had mild ST elevations thatpersisted inferiorly but were diminished prior to discharge.Preventive measures including nutrition and smoking sensationwere obtained. The patient appears reluctant to quit smoking.Cardiovascular pump , the patient has a history of hypertension ,which was well controlled throughout her hospitalization.Isordil and hydralazine were initially held on admission while onthe nitroglycerin drip. The ACE inhibitor was held secondary toacute renal insufficiency. Therefore , the beta-blocker wastitrated up. Upon discharge , the patient may reinitiate onlow-dose hydralazine and Isordil as well as reinitiation of theACE as tolerated with renal function. In addition , the patienthas a history of diastolic dysfunction , which is likely due toher history of hypertension. An echocardiogram from October 2005during a prior admission for heat failure showed an EF of 60% , aswell as inferior apical hypokinesis , mild elevated LVEDP. Thepatient appeared mildly hypervolemic during her hospitalizationbut did not show any signs of acute congestive heart failure.Initially diuresis was held secondary to acute renalinsufficiency. However , she received Lasix 40 mg IV x1 on2/16/05 due to abdominal discomfort and distention due to mildvolume overload. Cardiovascular rhythm , the patient wascontinued on telemetry throughout her hospitalization. She hasno history of arrhythmias and no events were noted on hertelemetry. She obtained EKGs , which showed no significant changeor nodal blockage.2. Endocrine , the patient has a history of insulin-dependentdiabetes , which was moderately well controlled throughout herhospitalization. She has a history of hemoglobin A1c of 7.3 asof February 2005. Upon admission , glyburide was held and thepatient was continued on Lantus as well as a sliding scale ofRegular Insulin. She obtained fingers sticks a.c. and h.s.Glipizide was initiated on 2/16/05 and will be titrated up astolerated as an outpatient.3. Respiratory , this system was stable throughout admission.The patient had crackles on exam , but no significant pulmonaryedema on chest x-ray. Abdominal CT on 7/16/05 was notable formoderate right and trace left pleural effusions. The patientmaintained excellent pulse oximetry on room air without anyrespiratory compromise.4. Renal , upon admission , the patient was noted to have acuterenal insufficiency with a creatinine of 3.2. The patient has ahistory of chronic renal insufficiency secondary to hypertensivenephropathy , diabetic nephropathy , and likely renal arterystenosis. Prior renal ultrasound showed an atrophic left kidneywith mild decrease in perfusion. Following admission , thepatient was initiated on D5W with 3 ampules of bicarb as well asMucomyst in preparation for likely cardiac catheterization. Shewas continued on IV fluids following the catheterization.Despite these preventive measures , the patient had a markedincrease in her creatinine following cardiac cath with a highcreatinine of 5 on 7/20/05 . Renal consult was obtained andadvised continued treatment. A urine sediment was obtained whichwas consistent with ATN. An abdominal CT showed evidence againof an atrophic left kidney. Creatinine was noted to begin todecrease on 7/16/05 and was 4.2 the day before discharge. Thepatient will follow up with Dr. Lamantia in Nephrology within threemonths' time.5. GI , the patient was noted to have right upper quadrantabdominal pain on 7/20/05 . She had had mild elevations in herLFTs , most notably an alk phos of 293. However , these valuesstabilized throughout the remainder of the hospitalization. Anabdominal CT was obtained without contrast that showed no sign ofobstruction , hepatobiliary disease , but was notable for a ventralhernia that was not strangulated or incarcerated. The patientcontinued to pass and had regular bowel movements. She wascontinued on bowel regimen. The pain was thought to be likelysecondary to ventral hernia with increased volume status.Therefore , she was given a mild diuresis to decrease volumeoverload.6. ID was stable.7. Heme , the patient was noted to have a hematocrit drop priorto cath. She dropped from 32 to 26. She was transfused twounits of packed red blood cells prior to catheterization in orderto keep the hematocrit greater than 30. There was no acutesource of blood loss noted. Guaiac stools were negative. Thereis likely a component of anemia of chronic disease secondary tochronic renal insufficiency. The patient's hematocrit continuedto trend down and on 7/16/05 , an abdominal CT was obtained torule out retroperitoneal bleed , which was negative. The patientwas transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on 7/16/05 .She will likely require a further anemia workup as an outpatient.8. FEN , the patient was not given any electrolyte scalessecondary to her acute renal insufficiency. She was noted tohave hyponatremia with a lowest of 123 and was therefore placedon free water 1.5-liter restriction with adequate resolution.The patient was also placed on a less than 2-gm salt restrictionto decrease volume overload. She was noted to have an increasedphosphorous level and was started on PhosLo. She had elevatedpotassiums , but this did not exceed 5. The patient was continuedon a cardiac/renal 1800 ADA diet. Prophylaxis included SCD andPneumoboots in the setting of anemia. She was continued on aproton pump inhibitor.CODE: The patient is DNR/DNI.DISPOSITION: Upon discharge , the patient was in stable conditionand will be discharged home without service. She was able toambulate without chest pain or shortness of breath toleratingp.o. intake well. She will have follow-up as noted in theaddendum. The patient was instructed not to smoke and to takedaily weights and if she gained more than 2 pounds per day or 5pounds in a week , she was instructed to call her doctor. Sheshould seek medical attention for worsening shortness of breath ,chest pain , weight gain , dizziness , worsening abdominal pain , orany other concerns.PLAN:1. Follow up with Dr. Chesebro , monitor for continued decrease increatinine. Consider reinitiating the ACE inhibitor withresolution of acute renal insufficiency. Titrate thebeta-blocker and restart nitrates as tolerated. Titrate upglipizide as needed. Consider further anemia workup. Encouragesmoking sensation. Continue to monitor abdominal pain/LFTs andconsider further evaluation of ventral hernia. Check LFTs withrecent addition of Lipitor.2. Follow up with Dr. Burkle post MI management.3. Follow up with Dr. Bottrell for management of chronic renalinsufficiency.eScription document: 3-4867035 CSSten TelDictated By: MERANTO , JOHNIEAttending: RICOTTA , JOHNATHANDictation ID 9210960D: 2/16/05T: 2/16/05

GASTROPARESIS.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Egelhoff is a 66-year-oldwoman who presented with one week ofincreasing shortness of breath with exertion , increasing peripheraledema , and increasing abdominal distention. She denies any chestpain , palpitations , chest pressure , nausea , vomiting , ordiaphoresis. She thought that her abdominal distention wassecondary to chronic constipation and her last bowel movement wasfour days prior to admission. She felt that her abdominaldistention was contributing to her shortness of breath because shewas unable to take deep breaths. In addition , she has a longhistory of chronic anemia with no clear diagnosis. She denied anymelena or bright red blood per rectum. She also has a long historyof low back pain , so she does not lie flat to sleep. In addition ,she complains of some early satiety. She denies fevers , chills ,chest pain , palpitations , lightheadedness , nausea , vomiting , weightloss , or known weight gain.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Poorly controlled diabetes with intoleranceto Humulin insulin ( she believes this madeher retinopathy worse ) , peripheral neuropathy , gastroparesis ,coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease , status post aleft femoral popliteal bypass surgery , chronic constipation , carpaltunnel syndrome , history of Acinetobacter pneumonia in 1997 ,chronic anemia , Charcot foot , status post open reduction internalfixation of a left ankle fracture , status post cholecystectomy ,history of C. difficile colitis , echocardiogram in 1997 revealingleft ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 55% ,Persantine thallium in October of 1994 revealing moderate anteriorischemia in the left anterior descending territory.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: NPH pork insulin , 42 units q.a.m.;Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.; Vaseretic10/25 mg q. day; aspirin 325 mg q. day; Senokot; Niferex 150b.i.d.; diazepam 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Avandia 4 mg p.o. q. day.ALLERGIES: Aldomet , Procardia , Darvocet causes drowsiness ,Percocet causes vomiting.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. Her son is involved in hercare. Occasionally she lives with him. She doesnot smoke or drink. Her husband died of complications of acoronary artery bypass graft about one year prior to admission.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Uncomfortable secondary todistended abdomen. Temperature97.3 , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 172/68 , respiratory rate 18 ,96% on room air. Her HEENT exam revealed a clear oropharynx ,nonicteric sclerae. Extraocular movements were full. Her neck wassupple with 2+ carotid upstrokes and a faint left carotid bruit.Jugular venous pressure was difficult to assess secondary to bodyhabitus. She has bibasilar crackles in her lung fields. Her heartwas regular rate with a normal S1 and somewhat loud S2. She has nomurmurs , rubs , or gallops. Her abdomen was soft , slightlydistended , and obese. She had no shifting dullness and nohepatosplenomegaly. Her extremities were remarkable for 2+ pittingedema , right greater than left. She had weak pulses bilaterally ,weaker on the left than the right.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 135 , potassium 4.2 ,chloride 95 , bicarb 30 , BUN 34 ,creatinine 1.3 , glucose 212 , ALT 15 , AST 14 , alkalinephosphatase 76 , total bilirubin 0.4 , CK 53 , troponin I - 0.00 ,albumin 4. White blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 28.3 , MCV 86 ,RDW 13.3 , platelets 303. Urinalysis revealed 3+ leuk esterase withtrace blood , too numerous to count white blood cells , and 10-15 redblood cells. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats perminute with normal intervals and axis. She had an isolated Q wavein lead III. She also had T wave inversions in V5 and V6 whichwere unchanged from prior comparison EKG in 1998.HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Genna was initially admitted to theshort stay unit for blood transfusion , workup ofher chronic anemia , and diuresis for new onset congestive heartfailure. On hospital day #2 , she developed what appeared to be a32 beat run of ventricular tachycardia. She was thus transferredto the general medicine service for further management and workup.Her hospital course by systems is as follows:1. NEUROLOGIC. Mrs. Byfield continued to complain of low backpain which has been a chronic problem and forwhich she is followed by Dr. Petrocelli in spine clinic here at Go Tyredd Egebrat .  She reports that he has already madearrangements for her to undergo an open MRI at the Taha Memorial Hospital , as we do not have these facilities here , andwill follow up with him in clinic after she has this test. In thepast she has had cortisone injections without benefits , and it wasfelt that since she has no acute exacerbation of this chronicproblem and already had followup in place , further consultation wasnot necessary during this hospitalization. She was reinitiated onNeurontin 300 mg q.h.s. , then increased to b.i.d. , and to beincreased to t.i.d. as an outpatient. She reports that with thisregimen she finally was able to sleep at night and reports asignificant improvement in her neuropathic pain secondary todiabetic neuropathy as well as sciatica.2. CARDIOVASCULAR. Mrs. Sloas was aggressively diuresed forfluid overload in the setting of newcongestive heart failure. She responded well to IV Lasix. She hada cardiology consultation , and they determined that the ventriculartachycardia noted on the monitor was actually an artifact and notreal. A long discussion between the patient , her son , and herprimary care doctor was undertaken. Mrs. Glicken expressed herfervent desire not to undergo cardiac catheterization or coronaryartery bypass grafting because of her husband's traumaticexperience with these procedures. Given her reluctance to undergointervention , further diagnostic studies were deferred , such asstress testing. Her medical management was further optimized. Shewas continued on enteric coated aspirin. Her beta blocker dose wasincreased to 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. of atenolol with heart rate control.Her ACE inhibitor dose was also increased. Simvastatin 40 mg p.o.q.h.s. was added for LDL cholesterol of 184. In addition , Isordilwas added to her cardiac regimen to decrease preload. She will bedischarged on 160 mg p.o. q. day of Lasix. She was told that herdose may change , depending on her daily weights at home , and thisshould be coordinated with the visiting nurse as well as herprimary care doctor.3. GASTROINTESTINAL. Mrs. Jannetti continued to complain ofnonspecific abdominal pain as well asconstipation while in the hospital. She also had a significantbout of nausea and vomiting. She was given an aggressive bowelregimen including enemas , with good response. On 3/23 , becauseof persistent abdominal pain and a somewhat more firm abdomen , aKUB and upright was performed which was within normal limits. Thenext day her pain , nausea , and vomiting had significantly resolvedwith the addition of Reglan to her medical regimen for presumeddiabetic gastroparesis.4. ENDOCRINE. A hemoglobin A1c was checked during this admissionand was 9.5. Because of persistently high morningsugars , 8 units of NPH at night was begun in addition to her 45units q.a.m. Her blood sugars remained under 200 with thisregimen.5. HEMATOLOGIC. Mrs. Penington initially presented with a drop inher hematocrit to 28. She was transfused twounits of packed red blood cells with an appropriate increase in herhematocrit. Iron studies as well as B12 and folate levels werechecked and were within normal limits. LDH , bilirubin , andhaptoglobin were also within normal limits. Her hematocritremained stable throughout the further course of herhospitalization.6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Mrs. Loparco received a total of threedays of levofloxacin for a urinary tractinfection.7. Finally , she was seen both by physical therapy and occupationaltherapy and home referrals were put in place.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.q. day; atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.;Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Lasix 160 mg p.o. q. day; Lactulose30 cc p.o. b.i.d. , and can increase to q.i.d. as needed; lisinopril40 mg p.o. q. day; Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.i.d.; Niferex 150 , 150 mgp.o. b.i.d.; Senna tablets , two tabs p.o. b.i.d.; simvastatin40 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. x2 days , and thenincrease to 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.; NPH insulin ( pork ) 45 units subcuq.a.m. , 8 units subcu q.p.m.; diazepam 1 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.anxiety; nitroglycerin 1/150 , one tab sublingual q.5min. x3 p.r.n.chest pain; Oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. back pain , not toexceed four tablets per day; Motrin 600 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. backpain , not to exceed four tablets per day.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with homeservices.

She came in with aninferior/posterior myocardial infarction and was transferred to theCoronary Care Unit after initiation of TPA. Her cardiac riskfactors included tobacco , a question of hypercholesterolemia ,negative for diabetes , hypertension , and family history. Thepatient was a generally healthy female who smoked and had a historyof palpitations and atrial tachyarrhythmia as well as a junctionalrhythm and AIVR but no prior symptoms of coronary artery disease.She had been followed by Dr. Ulven for complaints of dizzinesswith palpitations and a work-up including a 24-hour Holter in 8/5with frequent atrial premature beats , short bursts ofsupraventricular tachycardia with occasional periods of junctionaltachyarrhythmia , and AIVR which correlated with the symptoms. Anecho in 8/5 showed a normal LVF with minimal mitral regurgitationand systolic bowing. On exercise tolerance test at the time , shewent seven minutes stopping with symptoms of fatigue. Her maximalheart rate was 76% and she had 1 mm ST elevations consistent withbut not diagnostic of ischemia. She was then managed on Procanalone with good result for her arrhythmia. She was previously ondigoxin but no longer on it. She was active at baseline able towalk two miles a day without chest pain , dyspnea on exertion ,orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , ankle edema , claudicationsymptoms , or other symptoms of cerebrovascular disease. Themorning of February , 1995 , she was in her usual state of health.She awoke at 11 p.m. on 11/27/95 with 5/10 substernal chest pain ,no shortness of breath , palpitations , diaphoresis , or lightheadedness , and no prior similar events. She became nauseated anddiaphoretic without radiation to the arms or back and no pleuriticor positional changes. They called the EMT and her blood pressurewas 116/62 , heart rate of 50 with her chest pain , she had NGT spraytimes two en route , and in the Emergency Ward , she complained ofsubsternal chest pain with her vital signs unchanged. There was noevidence of congestive heart failure. Her EKG showed 0.5 to 1 mmST elevations in II , III , aVF , and V6. There was no recent surgeryand no history of bleeds or cerebrovascular accident. TPA wasinitiated within less than thirty minutes following arrival. Shewas put on intravenous nitroglycerin , Heparin , morphine , andaspirin. She had a resolution of her pain within 45 minutesfollowing the TPA with return to baseline of her ST segments. Shewas transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further care.PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Atrial tachyarrhythmias ,hypothyroidism , and status postspinal fusion in 11/19 .ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission included Synthroid 0.125 mg andProcan SR 500 mg q.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: She had a twenty pack year history of smoking ,currently smoking half a pack a day , and noalcohol. She lived with her husband and her brother.FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died at 94 from cancer.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature was 97.5 , blood pressure 91/48 ,heart rate of 48 , O2 saturation 99% on threeliters , and weight 115 pounds. She was alert , oriented , andresponsive. NECK: Supple , 2+ carotids without bruits , and jugularvenous pressure was 5 cm. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: She had anon-displaced point of maximal intensity , regular rate and rhythm ,and normal S1 and S2 without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN:Soft , non-tender , and non-distended. RECTAL: Guaiac negative inthe Emergency Ward. EXTREMITIES: Negative for cyanosis and edemaand 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. NEUROLOGICAL:Non-contributory.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her sodium was 141 , potassium of 4.5 ,creatinine of 0.7 , her LDH was 290 , herfirst CPK was 53 , cholesterol was 222 , PA was less than assay , herNAPA was 1.0 , chest x-ray showed no evidence of congestive heartfailure or cardiomegaly , and her EKG in the Coronary Care Unit wasnormal sinus with 0.15/0.08/0.2 , 0.5 mm ST elevations in F , and noQ or flipped T waves.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit ,put on aspirin q.d. , and kept on Heparin. Weheld off on a beta blockade given her heart rate which was oftenless than 50 with a systolic blood pressure of 80 to 90. Herintravenous nitroglycerin was weaned off and she was given somefluid boluses secondary to the low blood pressure. We started heron simvastatin for her cholesterol and discussed smoking cessation.She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. Her peak CK was 789 withan MB fraction of 79.2 and her troponin was 20. Over the course ofseveral days , her CPK drifted down to 695 to 604 with MB fractionof 46.9%. Heparin was discontinued on 8/5/96 and the patient , on2/23/96 , had been encouraged to get up and walk around. She didso without any evidence of chest pain , she had no recurrence ofchest pain after this point , and on 8/5/96 , the Heparin wasdiscontinued and she continued to be pain free with ambulation. Onthe morning of 2/27/96 , she had an exercise tolerance test , amodified Bruce , which was positive. She went seven minutes andtwenty seconds stopping due to chest pain. There was no change inher blood pressure , her maximal heart rate was 89 , and the EKGshowed 2 mm ST downsloping depressions in V4 and V5 that developedwith exercise and persisted into recovery which was highlypredictive of coronary artery disease. She came back up to thefloor and we discussed doing a catheterization with her. At thetime , we kept her NPO. An hour later , she developed 8/10 chestpain that was relieved with one sublingual and she was pain freebefore the EKG could be done , however , thirty minutes after that ,she again developed 8/10 chest pain. An EKG showed 2-3 mm STelevations in V4 through V6 with pseudonormalization of T waves inII , III , aVF , and V3 through V6. Her pain decreased to 6/10 , shehad been restarted on Heparin , and put on intravenous nitroglycerinwith her blood pressure tolerating it. She was given sixsublinguals and 8 mg of morphine without relief of pain , heart ratewas 60 , and blood pressure was 100/60. She was taken to theCatheterization Laboratory. The catheterization showed rightatrial pressure of 1 , right ventricle 24/4 , pulmonary capillarywedge of 8 , arterial 110/70 , she had a 50% stenosis in her leftanterior descending , and a subtotal occlusion of her leftcircumflex which was opened with PTCA to 20%. She was kept onHeparin for another 24 hours following the PTCA and then theHeparin was discontinued. She remained pain free after her cardiaccatheterization/PTCA and was discharged home on 8/9/96 withfollow-up with Dr. Rumphol . Her TSH level was checked given herhistory of hypothyroidism and her TSH was 1.0.DISPOSITION: Patient's hospital course was without complication.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin , ECASA , 325 mg q.d. , Synthroid 125micrograms q.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150sublingually one tablet q.5 minutes times three , and simvastatin 20mg q.h.s.FOLLOW-UP: Patient is to follow-up with Dr. Stikeleather in two tothree weeks.Dictated By: ERIN B.

In October of 1999 , shehad endometrial biopsy done that showed secondary endometrium. Shewas prescribed Provera and oral contraceptive pills without relief.She had a dilation and curettage performed at the Nesbot Strafound Hospital on April which showed normal pathology. Shecontinued bleeding and was prescribed Lupron. Office hysteroscopyshowed submucosal myomas with ultrasound showing a 2.5 x 1.8 cmintracavitary mass. She was told she could have a hysteroscopy ,but she is in desire to have an abdominal hysterectomy.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , not well controlled. Historyof heart murmur with normal echocardiogramin 1996.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Right herniorrhaphy in 1994.OB: She had normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries.SOCIAL HISTORY: Smoking two to three cigarettes per day. Deniesalcohol. She is a recovered cocaine abuser ,stating she has not used in six months. She had positive PPD inthe past and she was treated with INH for a year.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Lupron.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 1/30/99 and had atotal abdominal hysterectomy and bilateralsalpingo-oophorectomy with a blood loss of 300 cc. She was thenadmitted to the postoperative recovery unit and then to the floorin stable condition. On postoperative day one , she complained of alot of pain and was given much pain medication in response to this.On her examination , she only had superficial tenderness topalpation and to light to touch to skin. The patient absolutelyrefused to get out of bed for the first two and a halfpostoperative days. She was warned of the risk of deep venousthrombosis and pneumonia but still refused to get out of the bed.Her postoperative hematocrit was 28.0 , down from 30 on herpreoperative hematocrit. She complained of being unable to eat andstill refused to get out of bed on postoperative day three , sophysical therapy was consulted to help with mobilization. She didhave temperature of 101 on 7/13/99 and blood cultures , urineculture , and CBC was sent. Her white count was 7.9. Urine cultureswere 10 , 000. The next urinalysis was negative and blood culturesshowed no growth. She continued to have temperatures without goodambulation. A chest x-ray was performed which was clear. Thepatient's affect suggested some secondary game for delayingdischarge from hospital. She was receiving empiric clindamycin andgentamicin for approximately two days before discharge.She had been afebrile for greater than 24 hours at the time ofdischarge. A pelvic ultrasound performed on the day of dischargewas normal. She was eating well , eating French toast and eggs onthe day of discharge without problems.Dictated By: MASON SWOPES , M.D. RH50Attending: BRUCE RAXTER , M.D. UH75  WR079/4622Batch: 54718 Index No. X1PDPSRO3 D: 4/13/99T: 3/28/99

Neurology consultrecommended that we get an MRI/MRA of the brain with gadoliniumcontrast to look for leptomeningeal disease and other sources forincreased somnolence which are treatable. They also recommendedan EEG be done. The EEG was done and showed no seizure activity.The MRI/MRA was done and showed only a right MCA infarct , whichwas known and old with no interval change. Gadolinium contrastwas not given because the patient became too agitated and wasmoving too much during the study for an effective study to beobtained. They also recommended that we check certain labsincluding folate , B12 , TSH and RPR all of which were essentiallynormal. TSH was elevated but patient has a history ofhypothyroidism and is on Synthroid. Neurology was consulted onthe day of discharge and they agreed that no further evaluationof the somnolence is necessary at this time. If the somnolencecontinues into the near future further evaluation may benecessary. Leptomeningeal disease is unlikely given the lack ofnew neurological findings , and since the patient is scheduled fora PET scan of the chest to evaluate for spread of her known lungcancer , if there is no interval change in her oncological processthe likeliness of leptomeningeal disease is quite low.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily ,vitamin B12 1000 mcg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,Synthroid 100 mcg p.o. daily , Niferex-150 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,Senna two tablets p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. nightly ,Neurontin 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lovenox 40 mg subcu daily , Lamictal200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Seroquel 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Nexium 20 mgp.o. daily , Lidoderm 5% patch topically daily , NovoLog slidingscale , Cymbalta 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. daily.DISCHARGE EXAM: On the day of discharge , the patient wasafebrile with a temperature of 96.7. She remained slightlyhypertensive with a blood pressure range of 103 to 152 systolicand 54 to 90 diastolic. Her heart rate , respirations and oxygensaturations were all normal. She was urinating on her ownwithout a Foley catheter. Her blood sugars were stable. Aone-to-one sitter which had been placed prior during her hospitalcourse was discontinued. Her ciprofloxacin course for herurinary tract infection was discontinued because she had beentreated fully and her Lopressor was changed to Toprol-XL theextended release formulation for improved compliance andconvenience. At discharge , Ms. Klein 's mental statusremained at baseline and she showed no signs of agitation at thetime of my exam.FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: She has an appointment with her primarycare physician Dr. Baney , phone number is 010-743-1248 on10/26/06 at 10:40 a.m. She also has an appointment withNeurology Dr. Duplaga , phone number is 891-850-7392 and that ison 11/18/06 at 12:30 p.m. She has a PET study of her chest ,which has been scheduled on 8/21/06 at 08:30 a.m.PATIENT'S ONCOLOGIST: Rusty Magnall , MD at Purcmount Catstic Hospital CancerInstitute , phone number 763-624-6925.

He was initially admitted to the ENT service at that timewith lingual tonsillitis that was complicated by difficultyhandling secretions. During this admission he had an episode ofdesaturation which prompted transfer to the MICU on May , 2001.He was also febrile at that time with a productive cough. He wastreated with clinda and levo and intubated on October . He had anacute course of prolonged intubation with extubation finally on January .  Post extubation he was heavily sedated , with waxing and waningalertness , but gradually became more able to follow commands.The patient was discharged to Vancor on 10/10 with still somedepressed level of mental status. On the day of admission hedeveloped increased respiratory difficulty and increasedsecretions. This was new since his discharge. He became acutelytachypneic to the 40s and his oxygen saturation dropped into the80s on 100% nonrebreather. His mother reported that his lungs"sounded junky." He spiked a fever. Hypotension to a systolicblood pressure of 70 was also noted. For this reason he wastransferred to Cirygene Hospital for further management.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.( 2 ) Status post CVA with residualright-sided weakness.

Hematocrit 34.5 , white count 16.05 , platelets 226.INR - 1.5.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Pulmonary. The patient arrived at the Anall Health intubated. He had a history of pulmonary hemorrhageon his previous admission. However he was more easily extubated on10/27/01 and after that time continued to exhibit and inability tohandle his secretions. He did , however , maintain good saturationson progressively diminishing amounts of oxygen via nasal cannula.By the time of discharge , he was able to maintain an adequateoxygen saturation on room air. He underwent placement of a PEGtube on 2/3/01 in order to feed him without aspiration after aspeech and swallow study showed that he had problems withaspiration.2. Cardiovascular. The patient was managed with metoprolol andCaptopril , which was titrated up during this admission. Hisblood pressure was well controlled at the time of discharge. Hishypotension that characterized his presentation did not recur atall during his hospitalization.3. Infectious Disease. The patient was to complete a 21 daycourse of vancomycin from his prior admission but had ongoingfever and positive blood cultures for Staph epi. He completed anadditional seven days of vancomycin and was treated with Flagyl forseven days for his aspiration pneumonia. He was briefly alsotreated with ampicillin early in his hospitalization. By the timehe completed his 28 day course of vanco , the patient haddefervesced and had no signs of infection.4. Heme. The patient came to Jeunerah Memorial Hospitalanticoagulated with Coumadin. He however was transitioned toheparin so that he might be more able to get procedures if needed.He continued on heparin with an easily managed PTT. After his PEGtube placement , he was transitioned to Lovenox and Coumadin. Hewill be discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin. He will need to betransitioned to Coumadin alone once his INR is therapeutic.5. Neuro. The patient continued on his seizures medicines -Valproic Acid and Neurontin - during his admission. He had noevidence of seizure activity. His mental status improvedprogressively after intubation , however it was clear that he haddeficits in swallowing , significant enough to require the PEG tube.On discharge he was awake and alert and interactive.6.

ALLERGY: Patient was admitted with abdominal pain that was similar innature to prior episodes of hereditary angioedema flare. She was treatedwith ffp x 2units on admission with benadryl premedication. She diddevelop a few facial hives without any respiratory distress by the end ofthe second unit of FFP. This resolved after FFP infusion stopped and shewas given additional benadryl. She tolerated benadryl well , yet had asensation of restlessness afterwards. On 4/4 she got another 2 units FFPwith premedication of benadyrl 25 iv prior to each bag as well as ativan0.5 mg po prior to transfusions. This was a good combination as she didnot get hives , nor the anxiety that accompanies benadryl. By 8/21 , herabdominal distension had improved markedly and her pain had largelysubsided. Given the fact that prior episodes have taken a few days forcomplete resolution of distension , she was discharged with instructions tocontact her immunologist should symptoms worsen or persist.She will be discharged on a stanozolol taper as outlined byallergy/immuno. Please see patient instructions full regimen..During the hospital stay , she had no upper air way symptoms and was giventracheostomy care..ELEVATED HCT: On admission , HCT was 59 ( baselin is low 40's ). Part of theelevation was attributed to intravascular volume depletion. Lasix washeld for 3 days and HCT was 42% on discharge. No prior documented historyof polycythemia. Please consider further evaluation as outpatient forthis erythrocytosis..AFib: continued on digoxin and atenolol with good rate control ( HR 70-80sthroughout hospital stay. )CODE: Discussed with patient.

Cardiac examrevealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs orgallops. Abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds , some mildtenderness , question enlarged liver edge. There was positiveinguinal lymphadenopathy. Extremities revealed no clubbing ,cyanosis or edema , positive lichen planus. Neurological exam wasnonfocal. Rectal exam was deferred.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen by both InfectiousDisease Service and Hematology Oncology Service.The patient had an ANA which was negative. Rheumatoid factor wasnegative. Lyme titer was 4.5. Hepatitis C was negative. CT scanof the abdomen and pelvis done on 10/11 showed essentially no changewith multiple retroperitoneal lymph nodes , possible increased sizeof the left external inguinal lymph node. The ultrasound of theabdomen was negative for gallstones or biliary duct dilatation butshowed an abdominal aortic aneurysm of 2.5 cm. The patient had abone marrow biopsy which showed large atypical cells infiltratingwith fibrosis , a picture consistent with Hodgkin's diseaseinvolving the bone marrow. The patient had defervesced and wasscheduled for discharge on the day which the bone marrow biopsyresults were received.

He has an 80 pack year history ofsmoking. He was noted to have upper respiratory symptoms threedays prior to admission. One day prior to admission , he had somepink sputum and shortness of breath. He was admitted to Cox Hospitalwith possible COPD flare. At that time , he had massive hemoptysis ,was intubated and transferred to BUOHC for further management.Initially , he was seen by anesthesia and intubated with a doublelumen ETT for airway protection. He was taken to the O.R. thefollowing day and found to have an endobronchial lesion at the leftbifurcation of the upper and lower lobes. Samples were taken whichsubsequently revealed clot. An endobronchial blocker was placed.He had no further episodes of hemoptysis. On 3/15 , he had abronchoscopic Wang needle biopsy which was nondiagnostic but showedcells suspicious for non small cell lung cell cancer versussquamous metaplasia. He was easily extubated in the evening of3/15 without event.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes , alcohol , PAF , BPH ,glaucoma , osteoarthritis , DVTs , CVA of totalright internal carotid and 80% of the left internal carotid artery ,pilonidal cyst.ALLERGIES: To Keflex.MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Zestril 30 , NPH , aspirin.MEDS ON TRANSFER: Also include Diltiazem , levo. and prednisone ,Nexium , Nitropaste , trazodone , Ativan , Heparin ,Zestril.SOCIAL HISTORY: 80 pack years of tobacco. Alcohol in the past.FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: 1. Pulmonary: The patient had norepeat episodes of hemoptysis on thisadmission. He received a total body bone scan with no skeletalmetastasis found. CT of the chest on 2/10 revealed consolidationimproved since admission , no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathyand low attenuation areas of enlargement within both adrenalglands , unchanged from the admission CT. An abdominal CT showedcalcified gallstone , a left apical adrenal nodule needing furtherimaging and a tiny , hypoattenuating liver lesion in the right liverlobe. A CT scan of the head was negative for metastasis disease.Because of the finding in the adrenal glands , an MRI of the abdomenwithout contrast was also completed on the day prior to discharge.Results of the study are pending. The case was discussed with Dr.Doogan and Dr. Amoa and Dr. Hartt at length. It was decidedthat if there was no evidence of metastatic disease , the patientwould possibly be offered left upper lobectomy for both diagnosticand therapeutic purposes. If there were evidence of metastaticdisease on biopsy of a visible adrenal nodule , then potentialmedical therapy would include chemotherapy and radiation. Thepatient did well on the floor with O2 sats remaining in the upper90s on room air. At one point , two days prior to discharge , he diddevelop some mild inspiratory stridor. There was a question ofaspiration pneumonia; however , chest PA and lateral was negative.2. Cardiovascular: The patient developed atrial fibrillation inthe setting of hemoptysis. He was loaded with IV amiodarone andsubsequently returned to normal sinus rhythm. He was onmaintenance dose of 200 mg p.o. q. d. and remained in normal sinusrhythm. He also had hypertension and was started on Captopril andLopressor for better blood pressure control. Amiodarone willlikely be stopped at the time of discharge.3. Renal: Creatinine has been stable throughout hospital course.4. ID: The patient has been on levo. and Flagyl for presumedaspiration pneumonia. He completed a two week course of thesemedications. PPD was negative. BAL was negative for infectiousorganisms.5. GI: Was on Nexium for GI prophylaxis. Because the patient wasintubated for several days , he had significant swallowingdifficulties with possible aspiration. A video fluoroscopy studyrevealed penetration and aspiration of all consistencies secondaryto decreased epiglottic deflection and moderate residue in thepiriform sinuses. Thus the patient received an NG tube andreceived all feeds and pills through it. He is to remain NPO untila repeat video fluoroscopy is performed.6. Heme: The patient received one unit of packed red blood cellsduring his stay and his hematocrit remained stable thereafter.7.

The patientpresented from her nursing home on responses status post witnessseizure activity and new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR. Thepatient recently admitted on 10/22 with proteus UTI requiringintubation , discharged to rehabilitation and extensive courses ofcefpodoxime. As per the EMS , the patient had tonic-clonicseizure activity with tachycardiac to 180s and desaturated to70%. Notable studies at that time , chest x-ray without obviousinfiltrate , head CT without acute changes or left MCA territoryinfarct was noted. Urinalysis is notable for grossly infectedurine. The patient was admitted to the MICU where the patientwas aggressively resuscitated with normalization of bloodpressure. The patient's urine culture grew enterococcus and shewas treated with ceftazidime and vancomycin given her history ofMRSA and proteus UTI.

He had an upperendoscopy which showed an ulcer in the distal esophagus andproximal stomach. He had a repeat EGD and biopsies of the ulcerwhich showed adenocarcinoma of the proximal stomach and distalesophagus. Metastatic workup showed only thickening at the GEjunction and one enlarged lymph node in the periportal region 3.4x 1.6 cm. The patient was referred to Dr. Dunks for resectionand was planned for an esophagectomy.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history includeshypertension , ischemic cardiomyopathy , noninsulin dependentdiabetes , kidney stones , status post laser lithotripsy , historyof hyponatremia , myocardial infarction six years ago ,hypercholesterolemia , and an infrarenal abdominal aorticaneurysm.HOME MEDICATIONS: Prevacid 30 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 10 mg q.day ,Toprol-XL 50 mg q.day , Glyburide 2.5 mg q.day , Zestril 5 mgq.day , aspirin 325 mg q.day and Coumadin alternating 5 and 2.5 mgp.o. q.d.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient came into the hospital , afteradmission was taken to the operating room on 9/5/03 . In theoperating room he underwent exploratory laparotomy biopsy of aportacaval lymph node. Uterolithotomy on the right side , liverbiopsy , cystoscopy , placement of double J ureteral stent on theright side and open nephrolithotomy. The large right ureteralstone was found upon exploration and urology was called for anintraoperative consult. Please see both Dr. Moriarity and Dr.Cushard dictated reports for more information. There was avery high amount of blood loss approximately 17 litersintraoperatively from venous plexus bleeding of the pelvis andkidney and the patient was closed after stomach mobilizationwithout resection of his tumor and admitted to the Angeles Vandie Morepa surgicalintensive care unit. The patient was left intubated due to hislarge fluid and blood product replacement and surrounding facialedema. He was kept intubated , paralyzed and sedated , started onLopressor , put on a rule out MI protocol , kept NPO with anNG-tube. His electrolytes , CBC and coagulation labs werecorrected. The patient had multiple abdominal drains and waskept on triple antibiotics. Over the next several days , thepatient was kept intubated and sedated. His chest x-raysrevealed some early ARDS and he continued to need blood productincluding red cell and platelet and FFP transfusions. Heunderwent bronchoscopy in the intensive care unit and was slowlyweaned on his valve dilatory settings. Over postop day 4 , 5 and6 the patient began to spike some fevers up to 102. He had beenweaned to pressure support ventilation and was beginning to autodiurese. He then started on tube feeds of small amounts whichwere increased as tolerated.Over the next couple of days as the patient's sedation was weanedand he woke up more , it was noticed that he had decreasedmovement of his left lower extremity and upon examination andgiven his recurrent fevers , there was a question of an epiduralhematoma. He was scheduled for an MRI to assess this. He wastolerating tube feeds well and these were increased and his labswere stabilizing. Neurosurgery was consulted and it wasascertained that the patient did have an epidural hematoma ,therefore his epidural was removed and this was deemed likely tobe secondary to trauma from the epidural. It was decided thatthe patient would benefit from evacuation of epidural hematomaand the patient was made NPO and taken back to the operating roomon 8/18/03 . He underwent a T5-T8 laminectomy with evacuation ofthe epidural hematoma. Please see the dictated operative reportfor more information , but a handful of clot was removed from thearea. The patient was transferred back to Or Ox Nor , intubated andstable having tolerated the procedure well.Thereafter , the patient was more awake and alert and more quicklyweaned off his ventilatory support. His fingersticks were moredifficult to control and he was therefore started on theHeartland protocol and was seen by the Diabetes ManagementService. The patient was extubated on 9/11/03 and was doing wellon a face mask on that day. His tube feeds were restarted andspeech and swallow was consulted to evaluate the patient. Hebegan to be seen by physical therapy for his lower extremityweakness. The Cardiology Service was consulted on 8/18 and askedto optimize medical management of the patient's ischemiccardiomyopathy. They recommended discontinuing and titrating thepatient's Lopressor. He had been somewhat tachycardic previouslyand this resolved shortly. Speech and swallow saw the patientand initially cleared him for soft foods and thickened foods andthis was likely just due to endotracheal tube trauma. Afteranother day or two they cleared him for all regular foodsincluding thin liquids without any restrictions.For the patient's epidural hematoma , he had been started onVancomycin and it was decided that he would get a total of athree week course of Vancomycin. Urology continued to followedthe patient and wanted at least one Blake drain kept in place andthe Foley catheter kept in place. The patient did have a CT scanon 10/19/03 which demonstrated no urine leak on the CT urogram.The patient continued to be seen by physical therapy every dayand was doing very well. It was very difficulty initially tonormalize him but by the time of discharge he was up walking withthe walker with physical therapy and doing quite well.Infectious disease was consulted to confirm the three week courseof Vancomycin was appropriate for the patient's epiduralhematoma , and they agreed and thought no other interventions ortreatment as needed at the time. The patient was transferred outof the intensive care unit on 10/19/03 .Neuro: At this time he was getting increasingly more oriented.He had had some ICU psychosis and confusion and he was taking nopain medication. He was stable from his neurosurgery procedureand neurosurgery was following him.Pulmonary: His lungs were clear. He was now stable on room air.From a cardiovascular standpoint , he was stable and continued onhis low dose Lopressor.Gastroenterology: He was tolerating a house diet , eating smallamounts.GU: As stated , the urologist wanted to keep the Foley catheterand keep one of the Blake drains upon discharge.From a hematology standpoint , the patient had a stablehematocrit. From an infectious disease standpoint , the patientwas continued on IV Vancomycin for three weeks. He had a PICCline placed on 9/22/03 which was put in good position.From an endocrine standpoint , he was placed on glyburide ,continued to be followed by diabetes and also on a humalog scale.From an activity standpoint , he was seen by physical therapyevery day.Over the ensuing few days he was begun on calorie counts to seehow much of the diet he was tolerating and he continued to workwith physical therapy. His glyburide and insulin doses weretweaked a little bit by the diabetes management service and hewas improving every day as was his mental status. He had beendischarged from the unit with a one-to-one sitter but this wasvery soon thereafter stopped on 10/21/03 . He was stable medicallyabout 3/11 or 2/4/03 for discharge and was ______ for arehabilitation facility appropriately. He was accepted to arehab facility near his home on 5/16/03 , Dis University Hospital and was readyto go.From a neurologic standpoint , he is awake and oriented x3 most ofhis time. His back limbs are stable. The staples have beenremoved by neurosurgery and he will follow up with Dr. Ochwatfrom Neurosurgery in a couple of weeks.

Her symptoms areconsistent with a viral bronchitis with some reactive airway disease.She got relief from duoneb and was discharged with a new albuterolinhaler. She will also be treated with an empiric course of protonix totreat reflux which may exacerbate reactive airway disease or in itselfcause night time cough. There was no evidence of pneumonia on CXR.-Sputum gram stain and culture pending at discharge.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted with concerning changes on your EKG and chest pressure.Numerous studies were performed and show that your heart gets adequateblood flow during rest and exercise. You did not have any evidence ofheart attack either. Your cough and chest discomfort are most likely dueto an upper respiratory tract infection. This may also make your asthmaworse. We would recommend using your asthma inhaler during the day forcough and wheeze. Also we would recommend trying a low dose of stomachacid reducer ( protonix ) as acid reflux can also make cough worse..KEY MEDICATION CHANGES:Continue all medicines that you were taking before with the followingchanges:1. Atenolol. Take 100 mg daily ( increase from 75 mg daily. ) You werenoted to have high blood pressure even on your current dose.2. Prilosec. Take as directed for 2 weeks. This may help your chroniccough.3. Albuterol inhaler ( Ventolin. ) Please take as directed.4. Robitussion , sugar free. Take as directed for cough..Please return to your doctor to check in on how you are doing in the next2 weeks. Return to the ER if you are having difficulty breathing ,recurrent chest pain , or other concerning symptoms.DISCHARGE CONDITION: StableTO DO/PLAN:1. Followup sputum gram stain/culture.2.

The patient was very cooperative while in the hospitaland showed no signs of being febrile or other signs of activeinfection. No other signs of pulmonaryinfection were identified that could account for hemoptysis.It also did not appear that the patient had any form of possible lungmalignancy because he did not report weight loss or other suggestive featuresTo further work-up this up however , the patientreceived a spiral CT scan of his chest which showed no focalabnormalities and was notable for clear lung fields and no signs oftuberculosis. As this was the case , the patient was subsequentlydischarged home having been ruled out for tuberculosis.

She had some mild distal left upper extremity andproximal left lower extremity weakness. Gentle range of motionof her left hip caused pain.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 1/9/05 forinitiation of IV antibiotic therapy at the request of theInfectious Disease Service under the direction of Dr. Willy H Kirkey . Prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy , she hadblood cultures drawn , which ultimately showed no growth. Givenher neck pain and slight weakness , she also had an MRI of hercervical spine performed , which showed no evidence ofosteomyelitis. Preoperatively , she was seen by both theInfectious Disease Consult Service as well as the Medical ConsultService. She was placed on a low-dose beta-blocker at therecommendation of the Medical Consult Service. On the morning ofhospital day 2 , the beta-blocker was then discontinued under therecommendation of the Medical Consult Service , as it was felt tolikely add little benefit. She did receive one dose of Coumadinthe night before surgery in preparation for DVT prophylaxis. Shewas ultimately taken to the operating room on hospital day 2where she underwent removal of her left total hip replacementwith irrigation , debridement and placement of an antibioticspacer. Estimated blood loss was 2.5 L. She received six unitsof packed red blood cells , 9 L of crystalloid and 1 L of albumin.Intraoperatively , gross pus was found. Intraoperative cultureswere sent , which ultimately grew MRSA. The patient receivedperioperative stress dose hydrocortisone. Postoperatively , shewas taken to the surgical intensive care unit and intubated. Herpostoperative hematocrit was 29.2. The morning of postoperativeday 1 , the patient remained intubated but was able to open hereyes and follow commands. She was neurovascularly intact in theleft lower extremity. She was treated with Lovenox onlyinitially given that she did not initially have an NG tube sothat p.o. medications including Coumadin could be administered.She was continued on the vancomycin. The patient remainedintubated throughout the remainder of postoperative day 1 andinto the morning of postoperative day 2. Her hematocrit haddrifted down to 22.4 on postoperative day #1 for which she wastransfused two units with her hematocrit up to 26.2. Shecontinued to remain hemodynamically stable and neurovascularlyintact. An NG tube had been placed on postoperative day 1 , sothat p.o. medications including her Mestinon could be given forher myasthenia gravis. She was ultimately extubated mid morningon postoperative day 2. Her dressing was changed at that timeand the incision was clean and intact without any erythema. Thepatient remained in the surgical ICU until postoperative day 3 ,mainly with continued pain issues. She had been on a fentanyldrip and was transitioned over to Dilaudid PCA. She was startedon clear diet on postoperative day 3 and transitioned over toregular insulin sliding scale from the insulin drip that she hadbeen on to the early a.m. hours of postoperative day 3. Herhematocrit remained stable in the high 20s. Her right IJ centralline was changed out over a wire under sterile technique in theICU on postoperative day 3 prior to transfer to the floor. Shewas transferred to the floor in stable condition lat in the dayon postoperative day 3. She was taking p.o.'s at that time andher home medications were restarted including her homeprednisone. Postoperative day 4 , pain continued to be her mainissue and she was seen by the Chronic Pain Service forrecommendations on transitioning her off of the high-doseDilaudid PCA. PCA was discontinued and she was started on p.r.n.oxycodone in addition to her home a fentanyl patch and OxyContin.Physical Therapy worked with the patient throughout her hospitalstay and were able to first sit her up on the edge of the bed onpostoperative day 4. She continued to remain afebrile ,hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact throughout theremainder of her hospitalization. Her hematocrit was stable inthe high 20s. She had a PICC line placed on postoperative day 5for administration of her long-term IV vancomycin. The PainService continued to see the patient and titrate her painmedications with gradually improving effect. The Foley wasdiscontinued the morning of postoperative day 6 , as the patientbegan to be able to move around a little more easily. Bypostoperative day 7 , she was more comfortable , was tolerating aregular diet and voiding q. shift without a Foley. She wasafebrile , hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact. Shewas continued on both Coumadin and Lovenox given that her INR wasstill not therapeutic. She should continue on the Coumadin witha Lovenox bridge until the INR is therapeutic.

On the morning of admission , thepatient had had intractable explosive diarrhea. He does have ahistory of chronic diarrhea but the diarrhea on the date ofadmission was significantly more severe than usual.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denied any chest pain , nausea ,vomiting , urinary tract infection , or decreasein his p.o. intake.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for congestive heart failurewith an ejection fraction of 50% , coronaryartery disease status post five vessel coronary artery bypass graftin October 2002 , myelodysplastic syndrome , peripheral vasculardisease , gastrointestinal bleed status post right colectomy ,prostate cancer status post transurethral resection of theprostate , and macular degeneration.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: At the time of admission included opiumtincture , aspirin , Lomotil , Lasix , Ditropan ,Lopid , Zocor , Atapryl , and iron.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of admission , patient wasafebrile , his heart rate was 60 , his bloodpressure was 145/68 , and he was saturating 95% on room air. Hisphysical examination was notable for a jugular venous pressure at 5cm , moist mucous membranes , and soft , nontender , nondistendedabdominal examination. On rectal examination , the patient wasnoted to have guaiac positive brown stool.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Head CT at the time of admission wasnegative for any acute change , chest x-raywas negative for any evidence of pneumonia , and the patient's EKGwas reviewed and shown to be without change from prior studies.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Neurological - The patient's mental statusimproved quickly on admission. As noted above ,his head CT was negative. It was thought that his mental statuschanges were likely secondary to dehydration and were resolved atthe time of discharge.2. Pulmonary - During resuscitation of the patient's dehydration ,he developed an O2 requirement although chest x-ray did not showany evidence for fluid overload or infiltrates. Occasional wheezeswere appreciated on examination and the patient's symptoms improvedsignificantly with occasional nebulizer treatments of Albuterol andAtrovent. At the time of discharge , the patient was oxygenatingwell.3. Cardiovascular - There were no acute cardiac issues during thishospitalization. Patient's losartan was held at admission givenhis acute renal failure but other outpatient medications werecontinued.4. Hematology - The patient had a history of MDS and was a patientof Dr. Boivin . At the time of admission , the patient's hematocritdropped 10 points but was thought to be likely due to hydration.Since that time , the patient's hematocrit has remained stable at35.5. Infectious disease - At the time of admission , the patient'sblood cultures , urine cultures , and stool cultures were allnegative. Chest x-ray on January , 2003 was clear. It was feltthat the most likely etiology of his acute worsening of hisdiarrhea was viral gastroenteritis. He also did receive a 7-daycourse of levofloxacin and Flagyl for empiric abdominal coverage.The patient remained afebrile since the time of his antibiotics.6. Gastrointestinal - The patient is status post righthemicolectomy. He has a long history of diarrhea and presented tothis admission with explosive diarrhea and guaiac positive brownstool. At the time of admission , Kaopectate and Lomotil werestarted. On July , 2003 , he was noted to have increaseddistention but a KUB was negative at that time for partialobstruction or impaction. There were concerns that the patient'sabdominal symptoms might be secondary to ischemia so an MRI wasobtained which showed proximal disease in the SMA , IMA , and celiacbut overall with good distal flow. An abdominal CT was obtainedwhich showed a thick small bowel and dilated gallbladder withstranding but no evidence for ischemia. Gastrointestinalconsultation was obtained and on November , 2003 , andesophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which revealed grade IVgastritis. As a result , the patient was started on Nexium 40b.i.d.7. Renal - The patient has a history of chronic renalinsufficiency. The entire hospitalization , his BUN was in thefifties with a creatinine of 2.2. His FENA was less than 0.1% andthe patient was thought to be extremely intervascularly dry. Withgentle hydration , the patient's creatinine eventually improved to1.9 at the time of this dictation.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Included esophagogastroduodenoscopyrevealing gastritis as discussed above.DISPOSITION: Diet includes that the patient is discharged on afull p.o. diet. He was also instructed to supplementhis diet with high nutrition Boost shakes. Nutrition followed thepatient closely during the admission and thought that he would needclose follow-up as an outpatient for his nutrition status.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Will be dictated in an Addendum to thisDischarge Summary.FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Venzor followingdischarge.Dictated By: LUCIO MAN GRAMS , M.D. QA501Attending: ERASMO N.

924727476 | CG | 42816438 | | 7011259 | 8/6/2006 12:00:00 AM | RIGHT CHRONIC LEG ULCER | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 3/6/2006 Report Status: SignedDischarge Date: 1/16/2006Date of Admission: 3/6/2006ATTENDING: DEROCHER , SHAUN ANTONIO MDADDENDUM:ADMISSION TO THE ICU: 2/8/06 .This will be the hospital course and plan as well as thedischarge medications.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Lower extremity wounds: The patient had several left lowerextremity wounds which by report had been chronic as well as adeeper acute onset right lower extremity wound which wasulcerated to the level of muscle. It was thought that this woundhad occurred as a result of a hematoma after incision anddrainage by Surgical Service one to two weeks prior to admission.There was no obvious evidence of infection , however , it iscertainly possible that there is a soft tissue surrounding thatulcer. There was some thought of whether that could beosteomyelitis underlying the ulcer. The patient had tibial andfibula films which at first there was some consideration ofwhether there was abnormality to the bone. On furtherconsideration , it was felt this is most likely not the case ,however , to evaluate more specifically a bone scan was performed.There was no uptake in the area of that ulcer , however , therewas some mild uptake at the left Achilles tendon calcanealinsertion and marked uptake in the T9 thoracic 9th vertebrae. ACAT scan of the spine was performed which revealed no evidence ofinfection or neoplasm but there was evidence of osteopenia andpossibly a microfracture but no evidence of real compressionfracture. The patient was seen and examined by the VascularSurgery Consult Service and Dr. Smallidge , her primary vascularsurgeon. Their recommendation in terms of wound dressing wasthree times a day , wet-to-dry dressing changes with 4 x 8 gauzesponges. It was recommended that the patient follow up with Dr.Goolden in mid 9/6 .  Please call Dr. Usman 's office for anappointment. The recommendation for three times a day wet-to-drydressings without additional ointments or treatments. Thepatient should be followed by wound care service. In addition ,the patient has small necrotic regions on her heels. Theseshould be treated with Panafil. In terms of her sacral decubitusulcer , the patient was seen by the Plastic Surgery Service , theydebrided the wound twice , there was minimal amount of superficialnecrotic tissue which was excised. Their recommendations forfurther care were to apply one-quarter strength Dakin's solutionsoaked wet-to-dry dressings to be changed twice a day for 48hours that will be for 36 hours from discharge and then thistreatment should be changed to standard wet-to-dry dressingstwice daily to that sacral decubitus ulcer. They recommend thatshe be placed on an air mattress. She should have turns at leastevery 2 hours. They also recommend that her weight be kept offthe sacrum and that her nutrition be optimized. She was placedon a multivitamin , continued on calcium , started on zinc , vitaminC supplements as well. The patient should follow up with Dr.Roscoe Szymonik as an outpatient. This should be scheduled bycalling 390-948-8630.2. Infectious disease: The patient was initially admitted witha low-grade temperature. It was unclear whether she had aprimary infection and what the source of that infection was.Cultures were taken from blood , urine , and sputum. All bloodcultures were negative. Urine culture grew extended spectrumbeta-lactamase resistant Klebsiella pneumonia which wasintermediate to ciprofloxacin and sensitive to levofloxacin.Because the patient has so little urine output it was unclearwhether at first this was a colonizer or an actual infection.Infectious disease consultation was requested. Theirrecommendations were to start ciprofloxacin and then this waschanged to levofloxacin when the final susceptibilities came backand they continued that for a two-week course. She is currentlyon levofloxacin 500 mg IV q.48h. This course will finish on9/4/06 . Sputum cultures grew multidrug resistant Pseudomonasaeruginosa as well as a few Acinetobacter which were alsoresistant to many antibiotics. After close consultation withInfectious Disease Consultation Service it was decided that thesewere most likely colonizers. There was no evidence of an acutepneumonia or tracheobronchitis and the patient was not treatedfor her colonization with Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. In thepast she has had multiple other multiple drug resistant organismsthat grew from her sputum cultures at other institutions and itwas felt that unless she demonstrated evidence of clinicalpulmonary infection these should not be treated. Overall , herhemodynamic status was stable and she was afebrile throughout hercourse. Several days into her admission , however , she did haveone episode of low blood pressure initially treated withintravenous fluids and then norepinephrine infusion for shortperiod of time. However , on repeat cuff pressure manually it wasrevealed that her blood pressure actually was normal and thatthere was dysfunction possibly because of her obesity of theautomatic cuff , therefore it was thought that this low bloodpressure was spurious and probably an artifact of the cuff thatwas being used. So in conclusion the only medication ondischarge will be levofloxacin 500 mg q.48h. through 9/4/06 .3. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of coronary arterydisease and atrial fibrillation. She was on Toprol 12.5 mg bymouth two times a day throughout her stay. Her heart rate rangedfrom 120s-130s when she was first admitted to 50s-60s ondischarge. This should be readdressed regularly in terms of herneed for rate control. At this point , she will be discharged onthat low dose of beta-blocker. Otherwise , she was admitted onCoumadin with a INR of 2-3 for her St. Jude's aortic valve. HerINR was therapeutic on admission. This was actually discontinuedafter a couple of days in anticipation of a possible procedure.It was restarted three days prior to discharge. She was onheparin as a bridge for anticoagulation in the meantime. Sheshould be continued on the heparin with a goal PTT of 50-70 untilher INR is therapeutic at 2-3 and this should be rechecked tomake sure that her INR remains therapeutic. Her care wasdiscussed with her primary cardiologist , Dr. Sean Mesa .4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes.Her diabetes was controlled with insulin NPH 35 unitssubcutaneous every morning with a regular insulin sliding scaleevery 6 hours as well. This should be continued and fingersticksshould be done every 6 hours. The patient also has a history ofhypothyroidism. Her thyroid stimulating hormone level waschecked and was found to be elevated at 14.5. Her thyroidreplacement dose was increased from 75 mcg per day to 88 mcg aday. Her thyroid stimulating hormone level should be checkedagain in four to six weeks and dose adjustment accordingly.5. Pulmonary: The patient was continued on her mechanicalventilation. There were attempts at lower pressure support andeven spontaneously breathing trials. She was not able totolerate these for a long period of time , however , it does seemthat she has improved to some degree in terms of her ventilatorymechanics. She is currently on pressure support ventilation at15 of pressure support and 5 of positive end expiratory pressurewith an FIO2 of 0.4. We believe that she could probably beweaned slowly to significantly decreased pressure support and Ibelieve most likely she will be able at some point to be takenoff the ventilator , although this is certainly not certain. Shewill be continued on her nebulizer treatments.6. Nutrition: The patient was continued on tube feeds. She ison full strength Nepro at 50 cc per hour. In addition , she isgetting vitamin C supplementation , ascorbic acid 500 mg by mouthtwo times a day , Nephrocaps , zinc sulfate 220 mg by mouth dailyand these should be continued as indicated for her renal failureand wound healing.7. Psychiatric: The patient was continued on her home dose offluoxetine 20 mg by G tube daily and on Zyprexa 10 mg by G tubeat bedtime.8. Prophylaxis: Throughout her stay , the patient was continuedon her home esomeprazole 40 mg by G tube twice a day and for deepvenous thrombosis prophylaxis , her INR on Coumadin remained above1.4 and her PTT was kept therapeutic on intravenous heparin.Intravenous heparin should be continued with PTT checks onadmission and then every 6 hours unit they were fairly stablebetween 50 and 70 and that should be monitored at least dailyuntil her INR is stably therapeutic. It will be very importantto monitor her INR carefully while she is on levofloxacin aswell.9. Access: The patient has a left-sided midline which wasplaced in mid 8/6 .  This should be removed within the nextone week and another line placed as preferred by therehabilitation physician. In addition , the patient's dialysiscatheter while functional does seem to have eroded through theskin below her clavicle. The hemodialysis service should beaware and consider replacement as indicated. At this point thereis no indication of infection of either of those lines , however ,she is at high risk of infection of both.10. Renal: The patient was continued on her hemodialysis as perthe Renal Service. Please feel free to contact Dr. Napoleon R Lafevre , the patient's ICU physician here at Ciledall Hospital with any questions you may have. As noted in thedictation , the patient should follow up within the next three tofour weeks with Dr. Mcniel of Vascular Surgery and also with thePlastic Surgery Service.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:1. Vitamin C 500 mg by G tube two times a day.2. Peridex mouthwash 15 mL twice a day.3. Fluoxetine 20 mg by G tube daily.4. Heparin intravenous 1050 units per hour , this will beadjusted based on her PTT from this morning which is not yetavailable.5. Insulin NPH 35 units subcutaneous every morning.6.

He does not have diabetes mellitus , although hehas had chemical diabetes mellitus in the past while on steroids.He has been hypertensive.He is transferred from Ler Dition Hospital with questionablechest pain during the chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasebronchitis flare. In 10 of January he had an asthma flare. He had arespiratory arrest with intubation. Catheterization at that timeshowed a 40% LAD lesion. His wedge pressure was 20 mmHg. He hadnormal LV function on LV gram at that time. In 11 of March he had anonQ-wave myocardial infarction with CKs approximately 300. In2 of July he had another nonQ-wave myocardial infarction. CK isapproximately 700. In 7 of March he had an exercise tolerance test inwhich he went nine minutes. He had 1 mm ST depression in 2 , 3 andF. He reached maximum heart rate of 137 , blood pressure 186/80.Since that time he has had multiple , multiple admissions for asthmachronic obstructive pulmonary disease flares and rule out formyocardial infarction; each time ruling out. In 28 of May he was in theemergency room with vasovagal episode , treated with atropine. In12 of November he had an exercise tolerance test with thallium of which heunderwent four minutes. He had a blood pressure of 164/80. He didnot have any chest pain , ectopy or evidence of ischemia on EKG ,although there was questionable old infarct or ischemia at the apexon the thallium images. In 9 of February he had a chronic obstructivepulmonary disease flare. He went to Sampf. And Memorial Hospital .  He had achest pain. He refused cardiac catheterization at that time andwas felt to be not competent to do such. Then his mental statusimproved and he was deemed competent. He continued to refusecardiac catheterization. In 10 of September he was transferred fromSidegreen Louw. Hospital to Elkhays Healthcare after difficultybreathing and coughing up green-brown sputum for a couple of days.He had chest pressure radiating to his left arm and his jaw andthis lasted for hours. He ruled out at Rock Community Hospital formyocardial infarction. He had 0.5 mm ST depressions in V4 throughV6. He was treated there for unstable angina with nitropaste ,aspirin , heparin and transferred to Dely Hospital onaminophylline and heparin IV drips.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Vital signs - 98.1 temperature ,84 heart rate , 146/82 blood pressure , roomair sat was 98%. He was slightly labored breathing on admission ,but was not in respiratory distress. His jugular venous pulsationswere visible approximately 3 cm above the angle. He had decreasedbreath sounds bilaterally and moderate , diffuse wheezingthroughout. Heart - Sounds were very distant across the precordiumalthough audible at the epigastrium , S1 and S2 were normal. Therewas no murmurs , gallops or rubs. He did not have any rashes. Hismental status was intact although he had increased rate of speechand rapid thoughts.LABORATORY DATA: Admission - 141 sodium , 4.1 potassium , 100chloride , 27 bicarb , 118 glucose , 26/1.2 ,BUN/creatinine. WBC 10.39 , hematocrit 44.1 , platelet count 190.CK was 100. troponin 0.7 , calcium was 9.5 , magnesium 2.2 , valproicacid 42 level.EKG on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm at 68 beats perminute. He had a normal axis. His R-wave progression was normal.Intervals are 0.128 , 0.96 , 0.394. He had inverted Ts in 1 and Land nonspecific T-wave changes throughout with some 0.5 mm STdepressions at baseline in his inferior leads.Chest x-ray was normal.He was admitted and declined catheterization initially , asking about anexercise test first. He had his sputum gram stainwhich showed gram positive cocci and gram positive rods. He was started on IVcefuroxime. His heparin and aminophylline were discontinued onadmission. He was treated mainly for chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease flare. He had a history of steroid induced psychosis. Hewas treated with inhaled steroids and Albuterol and Azmacort vianebulization. He improved his peak flows on admission which wereapproximately 250; discharge peak flows were between 500 and 700.He underwent an exercise echocardiogram on 11 of August which showed onemm ST depression on top of the half mm baseline ST depressions ofthe inferior leads , potentially consistent with ischemia althoughwhen the echo images were reviewed they were not thought to beconsistent with ischemia. There was no change in wall motionduring exercise as compared to rest.This patient is scheduled to follow-up with me , Dr. Ollie Mcclamma inthe Villecoconess-penmont Memorial Hospital on April , 1997 at 1:50 p.m.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Cogentin 1 mgp.o. q. p.m. , Cardizem 90 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,Depakote 500 mg q. a.m. , 750 mg q. p.m. Ativan 1 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,Trilafon 8 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Azmacort four puffs inhaled q.i.d. ,olanzapine 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Albuterol MDI two puffs q.i.d. andp.r.n.

He wasstarted empirically on antibiotics. Sputum culture was positivefor Pseudomonas and treated with ceftazidime and levofloxacin.Also , noted at Ieldha Hospital to have 4/4 blood culturespositive for coagulation-negative Staphylococcus. He was placedon vancomycin. During the course of this hospital stay , he hadother medical issues including: Non-ST elevation myocardialinfarction. Also noted to have upper gastrointestinal bleed dueto supratherapeutic INR. Also had acute on chronic renal failurewith a creatinine of 7.7 , thought to be due to IV contrast. Hewas transferred to O Medical Center ICU after going intorespiratory distress at Sti Versut Center , for which he was intubated.He was continued on antibiotics at Onnau Hospital .  Inthe shore health center surgical ICU at the Quinla , he was also noted to havean improvement in his acute renal failure with his creatinineimproving to 2.0 range. With IV fluids , his non-ST elevation MIappeared to be resolving; however , was noted to have ongoingfevers despite antibiotics. Noted on abdominal CT to have freeair. He was taken to the operating room on June , 2005 ,and had sigmoid colectomy with colostomy and he remainedintubated postoperatively , and was transferred to Ins SurgicalICU. Postoperatively , he was continued on broad-spectrumantibiotics including vancomycin , ceftazidime , and was continuedon fluconazole for fungemia. Intraoperatively , he was noted tohave perforation in his sigmoid colon. He in the ICU , requiredLevophed and vasopressin. The patient was noted to have ongoingrespiratory failure. He required reintubation on October ,2005 , after a brief period of extubation. He returned to theoperating room on October , 2005 , where he had an ileostomy ,T-tube placement , and a tracheostomy. In addition , his abdomenwas explored and adhesions were lysed. Postoperatively , he wasnoted to have further improvement of his renal failure. He wasnoted to have improvement in acidosis; however , had ongoing slowwean off the ventilator. He was noted to have on followup CT tohave intraabdominal fluid collections along with his dailyfevers. On January , 2005 , he had a CT-guided drainage andplacement of a drain for one of these fluid collections. He hadsome ongoing improvement and was continued on vancomycin , Flagyl ,fluconazole , and ceftazidime post procedurally. Repeat culturesof sputum yielded ongoing Pseudomonas in the sputum sensitive toceftazidime. Also noted to have Aspergillus in his sputum.Thought to have possible colonization of his airways. Onfollowup CT , he was noted to have ongoing fluid collection aswell as daily fevers. He was discontinued on his central linesand had a change-out of his arterial line. He also obtained atagged white blood cell scan , which revealed an area ofenhancement in his right lower quadrant consistent with possibleabscess; however , this patient had decreasing frequency of feverswith discontinuation of lines and continuation of antibiotics. Moreover , thearea of enhancement on the tagged cell scan did not correlate with asignificant fluid collection on abdominal CT. After consultation with theInfectiousDisease Service , Interventional Radiology Service , and the Surgical Service , itwas decided that there would be no intervention done on thiscollection at this time. Otherwise , the patient now is startingPO and is having ongoing low-grade temperatures , but clinicallyimproving. From the respiratory standpoint , was liberated from mechanicalprior to discharge from the ICU.LABORATORY DATA: White cell count 16 , 000 , hematocrit 27 ,platelets 443. Chem 7: Sodium 134 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 95 ,bicarbonate 28 , BUN 36 , creatinine 1.7 , calcium 9.1. PT 14.9 ,INR 1.2 , PTT 34.1.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 50-year-old man with history ofcoronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , chronicobstructive pulmonary disease , chronic renal insufficiency , whois status post colectomy with ileostomy secondary to perforatedsigmoid colon , status post tracheostomy for respiratory failure ,prolonged ICU course secondary to pneumonia , sepsis , acute onchronic renal failure , and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.Neurological: The patient is now off sedative drips. He isalert and oriented and has chronic pain secondary to degenerativelower back disease; however , his pain has been well controlledwith his current regimen. Psychiatric consult was obtained andhe is noted to have an adjustment disorder with anxiety.Plan is to continue oxycodone as needed and continue Ativan asneeded.Cardiovascular: Status post non-ST elevation myocardialinfarction , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of30% , has had no further signs of pulmonary edema by x-ray or byclinical symptoms. He is off pressors. He has beenhemodynamically stable and in normal sinus rhythm.Plan is to continue amiodarone via T tube and continue digoxin.We will diurese with Lasix as needed to keep I's and O's even.Respiratory: Continues to be slow steroid wean. Liberated from mechanicalventilation prior to transfer out of the ICU. S/p tracheostomy , historychronicobstructive pulmonary disease , completing course of Pseudomonas pneumoniatreatments on ceftazidime.Gastrointestinal: Continues to be on tube feeds , goal rate. Wewill start advancing PO diet as tolerated with a plan to weantube feeds as the patient is able to tolerate further PO's. Wewill plan to start PO medications as tolerated.FEN/GU: Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.5to 1.7. Acute renal failure , resolved. He has been having goodurine output with no major electrolyte abnormalities.

He had some flat Ts in AVL and T wave inversionin V1. His chest x-ray had no infiltrate , no effusion and noevidence of failure. Laboratory revealed sodium of 138 , potassiumof 4.1 , chloride 103 and bicarbonate of 25 with BUN of 17 andcreatinine 1.2. His baseline was 0.7 in 4/10 .  Glucose was 186 andanion gap of 10. He had a white count of 8.2 , hematocrit of 17.9which his baseline was 39.5 in 4/10 , platelets of 280 and MCV of68. He had 66 neutrophils , 21 lymphs and 8 monos and PT of 12.1 ,PTT of 21.3 and INR of 1.0. His CK was 47 and Troponin was 21.9.His amylase was 28 and lipase was 187.HOSPITAL COURSE: By problem list: Heme: He had a hematocrit of17.9 down from baseline of 39.5. He wastransfused three packed red blood cells and his hematocritresponded appropriately. It was 34.5 by the day of discharge. Healso had iron studies sent off that showed a total iron bindingcapacity of 324 and ferritin of 20 consistent with iron deficiencyanemia. He was restarted on Niferex.GI: Given this guaiac positive stool and history of guaiacpositive stool in 1999 , he was thought to have an acute on chronicGI bleed questionably secondary to diverticulosis or cancer. Healso has history of gastritis. We kept him NPO. GI consult wasobtained. He underwent initially an esophagogastroduodenoscopywhich was completely normal. Esophagus had no varices , noesophagitis. Stomach was normal; no ulcer , no erosion or end NSAIDgastropathy. His duodenum to D3 was normal with smallperiampullary diverticulum. Colonoscopy was then performed whichfound sigmoid diverticulosis , 4 millimeter non-bleeding sessilepolyp which was removed by snare cautery and some mild oozing afterthe polypectomy but good hemostasis was achieved. Small , internalhemorrhoids were present but no active bleeding sites were found.On pathology , it was found to be a hyperplastic polyp. GI teamrecommended small bowel follow through to rule out small bowelsource for bleeding as an outpatient. The patient was kept on hisZantac 150 b.i.d. for history of gastritis. The patient was senthome on Tylenol for pain and told to avoid taking aspirin or anyother NSAIDs given his GI bleed.Renal: Creatinine was 1.2 on admission. His baseline was 0.9. Hereceived some IV fluids as he was NPO for his GI studies and hiscreatinine came down to 0.9. So , it was likely that he wasslightly volume depleted on admission.Cardiovascular: The patient had a history of angina but no recentchest pain and no cardiac complaints. With his hematocrit of 18 ,he had a flat CK and Troponin of 0.19 and had no further cardiacissues during this hospital course. He was kept off aspirin givenhis GI bleeding. THe patient also has hypertension and was onIsordil and Cardizem for that. His blood pressure meds were heldinitially on admission and were re-added back at the time ofdischarge as well as his Mevacor.Endocrine: The patient was maintained on his Humulin NPH andcovered with sliding scale during this admission. His blood sugarsremained in the 160 to 180 range.Pulmonary: The patient was kept on his Albuterol and Azmacortmetered dose inhalers and by the time of discharge , was withoutwheezes and satting well at 96% on room air.Neuro: The patient was kept on his Klonopin and Paxil for anxiety.Fluid , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient was started onmagnesium oxide for low magnesium during his hospital course.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Are as follows: 1.

Abouttwo weeks after her operation , she began to notice some swellingand erythema around her left thigh saphenous vein graft harvestsite. This increased and she came to the Emergency Room on17 of March .  She denied any fever , chills , night sweats , nausea , orvomiting. She stated there was a small amount of purulentappearing liquid draining from the wound.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for noninsulin dependentdiabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease ,hypercholesterolemia , supraventricular tachycardia , hiatal hernia ,osteoarthritis , chronic right ear abscess , and schizophrenia.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery bypassgrafting x3 with the left internal mammary artery to the leftanterior descending artery , and saphenous vein grafts to theposterior descending artery and the obtuse marginal artery.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100.4 , with her other vitalsigns stable. Her heart rate was regularwith a regular rhythm and no murmur. Her heart rate was 98 , andher blood pressure was 104/58. Her lungs were clear toauscultation , and her sternum was stable. Her left thigh waserythematous around the wound , with a large area of induration.She had good distal pulses , and her left foot was warm. The thighwound had an area of necrotic appearing skin.HOSPITAL COURSE: The staples were removed in this area ,and a large amount of pus was extracted.Some of this was sent for culture. The areas of necrotic skin weredebrided and after copious irrigation , the wound was packed withsterile gauze soaked in normal saline. She was started onVancomycin and gentamicin intravenously , and was admitted to thehospital for IV antibiotics and dressing changes. Her culturesgrew out staph aureus which was methacillin resistant , butsensative to gentamicin and vancomycin , as well as citrobacter ,which was sensative to gentamicin and vancomycin.She remained hemodynamically stable , and her white count came downfrom 14 to a stable level of 7-8. Her temperature on the secondday after admission was 99.6 , and never rose higher than that. Theerythema in the area of her wound decreased markedly , and sheremained pain free. The wound began to granulate very well , andthe lower portion of the wound remained clean and dry , while theupper portion required three different debridements over herhospital course. After this , however , the entire wound remainedclean and well granulated.The dressing changes were continued and the patient was screenedfor the Rehabilitation Service to follow up with some strengtheningand IV antibiotics and dressing changes. A follow-up culture wasobtained after one of the dressing changes , which grew out e. coli ,which was sensative to Cipro , ofloxacin , citrobacter , andenterococci. All species have been sensitive to ciprofloxacin.The patient was changed from vancomyin and gentamicin to vancomyinIV and ciprofloxacin p.o. She will receive a total of 14 days ofvancomycin , and seven days of ciprofloxacin , after seven days ofgentamicin.She was accepted for rehabilitation by Woodwa Herscotl Kuaen Region Medical Center , and on 25 of September , she was discharged to Wellma Sgriff Hospital in good condition.

Question of TIA in the past with right-sided numbness.BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:Ms. Elter is an 83-year-old Spanish-speaking female with historyof CAD , distant three-vessel CABG , CRI , NSTEMI in 10/29 ,treated with just medications , EF of 75% in 10/29 , whopresented one week of PND , dyspnea on exertion , and chestheaviness. This chest sensation did not radiate and wasunassociated with nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis orlightheadedness. The patient also had cough with green sputum x1year , no fevers or chills , no sick contacts. EMS gave Lasix andNitrospray. In the ED , she was briefly on a nonrebreather mask ,responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix , K was 5.8 and got Kayexalate.She became comfortable , sitting at 75 degrees , chest pain-free.Also , noted no change in bowel/bladder habits , no change in medsand no dietary changes. She had positive progressive lowerextremity edema x2 weeks.ALLERGIES:Lisinopril leading to hyperkalemia.SOCIAL HISTORY:Retired textile worker from Ral , lives with daughter , and isSpanish speaking.HOME MEDICATIONS:Aspirin , metoprolol , allopurinol , valsartan , glipizide , Lipitor ,and nifedipine.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:Temperature was 96 , pulse was 70 , blood pressure was 148/56 ,respiratory rate was 20 , and saturating 100% on nonrebreather andeventually in the high 90s on a couple of liters of oxygen. Ingeneral , she was in no acute distress , JVP 12 cm with positivehepatojugular reflux , soft bibasilar rales , regular rate andrhythm , 2-3/6 systolic murmur , loudest at the left upper sternalborder , ( mild AS on echo from 1/26 ). Abdomen was soft ,nontender , and nondistended , bowel sounds positive. Extremitiesshowed 3+ bilateral pitting ankle edema with weak distal pulses.LABORATORY DATA:Showed a sodium of 129 , potassium of 5.7 , creatinine of 2.8 witha baseline anywhere between 2 and 3.5 , cardiac enzymes negativex1 , BNP of 1448. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 73 , septalQs , QTC of 456. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , small bilateraleffusions , no infiltrate.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Rule out MI by enzymes and EKGwith a full set negative. Continued her aspirin , beta-blockers ,and statin for coronary artery disease. Pump: CHF flare withelevated BNP , volume overload , diuresed with Lasix and Diuril;salt/water restricted , kept strict I/O with moderate diuresis.After load reduced with ARB , weaned off her previous home calciumchannel blocker. Rhythm: Telemetry showing transient new atrialfibrillation with a maximum heart rate of less than 70 , whichspontaneously resolved after several hours. An echo showedstable aortic stenosis without any acute worsening. She also hada rhythm strip on the telemetry showing a regular focus ofventricular ectopy , also spontaneously resolving. This wastreated with continued beta-blockers. At the time of discharge ,she was in normal sinus rhythm.2. Renal: Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinineof 2.8 to 3.3 , with acute worsening in-house , most likelysecondary to over diuresis with Diuril/Lasix , also some prerenalcomponent secondary to fluid restriction. Her potassium waselevated initially , got Kayexalate , and then was low/low normalafter Lasix. Creatinine peaked at 4.1 , Lasix and ARBs were held.Urine study showed a prerenal component , also showed someproteinuria. Her creatinine eventually improved to 3.3 , and herbicarb improved from 17 to 23 with the closing of her acid gapfrom 17 to 11. Potassium was 4.5 at the time of discharge. Thepatient will need to follow up with Dr. Dasgupta , hernephrologist , and she was set up for an appointment on 2/18/04 .3. Endocrine: DM-2 , she was treated with regular sliding scaleinsulin with good blood sugar control. Her glipizide was heldgiven that her creatinine clearance was worsening. We did notrestart her glipizide at the time of discharge until follow upwith Dr. Ohlenbusch given her overall worsening creatinineclearance.4. Rheumatology: History of gout , change her allopurinol toq.72h. from q.o.d. secondary to creatinine clearance. She didcomplain of some left heel pain and left foot pain , thoughtsecondary to her gout. This improved at the time of discharge.5. Heme: Hematocrit dropped from 29 to 25 , her guaiac wasnegative on the 2/5/04 . She also has epistaxis at night forfour to five days. She was placed on humidified room air givennasal saline sprays and Afrin. Because of her coronary arterydisease , she was transfused total of 3 units over the course ofher hospital stay to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. Shewas given Lasix after her transfusions. An ENT evaluation showeda small area of ulceration in her posterior nasopharynx , whichwill need a follow up possibly with a CT as an outpatient to ruleout malignancy. At the time of her discharge , her hematocrit was36. Initially , Coumadin was started given her new onset ofatrial fibrillation. After consideration of risks versus benefitof anticoagulation , her transient atrial fibrillation whichresolved spontaneously , it was decided to continue any furtheranticoagulation and send her out just on aspirin. She didreceive subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis while in-house.GI: The patient initially had some constipation , which wasrelieved with stool softeners. The patient's stool was guaiacnegative. The patient received the PPI.DISPOSITION:The daughter who is the patient's healthcare proxy was made awareof the patient's status and disposition throughout her hospitalcourse. A PT evaluation indicated that the patient would benefitfrom a period of re-stay at rehab , however the patient familypreferred the patient to go home and was constant that they wouldbe able to provide 24/7 support over the next week as the patientwill need help in navigating her home which included two flightsof stairs. PT was comfortable with this and this was explainedthoroughly to the patient and her family with regard to the risksversus benefit of going home versus going to rehab. The patientwill follow up with Dr. Heingartner in one to two weeks , which hasnot been scheduled , and with Dr. Tsunoda with Nephrology whichhas been scheduled for 2/18/04 . Communication was made with Dr.Smyth regarding her admission here. The patient will be senthome with VNA support to follow up on her weights and fluidstatus , she will also have home physical therapy.CODE STATUS:Full code.MEDICATIONS:1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.2.

Chest x-ray: Showed no infiltrate or effusion.INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND BRIEF SUMMARY: This is a 27-year-oldfemale with a history of craniopharyngioma , status post resectionand XRT in 1993 with subsequent panhypopituitarism and chronicsleepiness. She was admitted to the General Medical Service on1/1/05 with a two-week history of a.m. confusion , visual changes ,ataxia , tinnitus , bilateral lower extremity edema , and shortnessof breath. She had also had easy bruising and a severe episodeof epistaxis requiring cauterization. Her blood work was notablefor pancytopenia. She then had swelling of her hands and arms aswell as a rash. MRI in 2/17 showed no change or evidence oftumor recurrence. The patient , while on the General MedicalService , had an extensive rheumatologic , neurologic , andhematologic workup , at which point she underwent both bone marrowbiopsy and unsuccessful LP under IV conscious sedation. Thepatient became unresponsive and hypothermic about 2 hours afterher bone marrow biopsy and was therefore transferred to the MICUon 10/6/05 for closer observation. She seemed encephalopathicduring this stay and was started empirically on ampicillin ,cefoxitin , and acyclovir. She was then sent for a CT-guidedlumbar puncture requiring intubation. She was extubated on4/18/05 . She was then transferred out to the floor where shecontinued to improve. Hospital course in more detail by systembelow.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and usesCPAP at home. Her outpatient pulmonologist at the Ceanmin Chbre Memorialwas contacted who confirmed this. On admission , she had a normalO2 saturation with a relatively clear chest x-ray. However , shebecame hypothermic and unresponsive following her bone marrowbiopsy. She also required intubation for CT-guided lumbarpuncture for airway protection in the setting of her excessivesedation. She was extubated on 4/18/05 and her oxygen wasquickly weaned off. Since then she has been oxygenating andventilating well on room air. CPAP was continued at night. Shehas had no other pulmonary complications.2. CVS. The patient has no history of cardiac disease. Anechocardiogram done on 6/1/05 showed normal LV function withpreserved ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities ,moderate tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral regurgitation.In terms of her rhythm , the patient has a resting bradycardia inthe 30s to 40s that is thought to be secondary to increased vagaltone and has no hemodynamic consequence. She received atropinewhile in the ICU at 1 mg x 1 on two separate occasions; in thefirst instance for bradycardia to a heart rate of 19 in thesetting of getting vasoconstrictors for a low blood pressure andthe second time when she had a heart rate down to 30. After thepatient was transferred out to the floor , we did obtain adedicated EP Service Cardiology consult , who evaluated thepatient. They confirmed that her bradycardia is most likely dueto vagal tone. She responds appropriately with an increase inher heart rate with exertion. In this young woman , it was deemedthat a pacemaker would not be an appropriate choice. She didhave 3-4 second pauses on one occasion on the floor but had norecurrence throughout the rest of her stay. If after dischargeshe develops further pauses or a syncopal episode , this issue canbe revisited. While she was in house , we did keep atropine andZoll pads at the bedside but did not have to use it once she wastransferred out of the ICU. In terms of ischemia , the patienthad a slightly elevated CK-MB on admission , but she has had anormal echocardiogram and negative troponin since.3. Renal. The patient developed acute renal failure during theearly part of her stay thought secondary to acyclovir , which hadbeen given for presumptive meningitis. Her abdominal ultrasoundwas negative and urine eosinophils were also negative. Hercreatinine improved with appropriate hydration and was normal atthe time of discharge ( creatinine equal to 1.0 ).4. The patient does have a history of hypernatremia. Initially ,her home DDAVP was held for fear that it would be difficult todiurese her if she became volume overloaded given her somewhatelevated creatinine. However , her sodium continued to increaseto 155 despite getting free water repletion , so her DDAVP wasrestarted on 10/5/05 . She was discharged on her home dose ofDDAVP of 0.2 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 0.4 mg p.o. q.p.m. with one nasalspray q.h.s. Her sodium at the time of discharge was 145. Shehas been followed by the Endocrine Service in house for this.They have recommended that she not increase her home dose ,instead she will aggressively increase her p.o. water intake inorder to maintain her normal sodium. She will follow up in twoweeks with Dr. Kearley of Endocrine who will recheck herelectrolytes at that time.5. Derm/Rheumatology. The patient was evaluated by both ofthese services during her stay. She had biopsies done of severallocations that showed nonspecific pathology consistent with mixedconnective tissue disease. However , her serologies have , for themost part , been negative. She was treated presumptively withstress-dose and eventually pulse steroids. These were taperedtowards her stay. She will be discharged on a quick taper ofhydrocortisone 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two days , after which shewill revert to her home dose of 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 10 mg p.o.q.p.m.6. Endocrine. The patient has panhypopituitarism and wasfollowed by the Endocrine Service throughout her stay. In termsof her thyroid function , the patient was continued on her homedose of Levoxyl. It was difficult to interpret her TSH in thesetting of panhypopituitarism; therefore we followed her T4 , T3 ,and free T4 levels. These were rechecked towards the end of herstay once she had recovered from her acute illness and in lightof a slightly decreased free T4 level , her Levoxyl was increasedto 275 mcg p.o. daily at the time of discharge.7. Diabetes insipidus. The patient's hypernatremia wascorrected with D5 water and increasing her p.o. fluid intake.She was also put back on her home dose of DDAVP.8. Growth hormone. There was no indication for growth hormonereplacement.9. Adrenal insufficiency. The patient completed a course ofstress dose steroids for her procedures and then got pulsesteroids per wound for a question of lupus versus mixedconnective tissue disorder. However , this was tapered over herstay and she will be discharged on a very brief taper. She willgo back to her home regimen of hydrocortisone.10. Gonadotropins. The patient was continued on Aviane ( OCP )during her stay.11. Neurologic. The patient had no clear etiology for herhypersomnolence. She was followed by the Neurologic Service inhouse. She does not appear to be hypercarbic or hypoxic. Herinfectious workup was entirely negative and she was thereforetaken off antibiotics. Her EEG showed nonspecific diffuseslowing with no seizure foci. The default diagnosis has beenthat some of her symptoms , including her altered mental status ,lower extremity edema , rash , and perhaps even pancytopenia , maybe secondary to Provigil. This was therefore discontinued andshe should not start this once she returns home. Initially , herstimulants were held for fear that they were contributing to herpancytopenia. However , her Ritalin was restarted once her countsstarted to recover. She was discharged on Ritalin-SR 20 mg p.o.b.i.d. Her mental status seemed to improve on this regimen. Atthe time of discharge , she was awake , alert , able to conversewell , and at her baseline.12. Hematologic. The patient presented with pancytopenia , againof unclear etiology. Bone marrow biopsy was negative forleukemia , lymphoma , and myelodysplasia. Rather , it wasconsistent with a viral effect or drug effect. Her counts hadresolved by the time of discharge with a white blood count equalto 9.26 , hematocrit of 27.6 , and platelets of 266. This too mayhave been due to Provigil effect.13. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Pepcid for GIprophylaxis and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.14. Code. Full.15. ID. The patient had multiple blood , urine cultures , and CSFcultures sent. These were all negative. Of note , stool culturewas positive for C. difficile. She was therefore started on p.o.Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. on 9/20/05 . She will complete a 14-daycourse of this antibiotic.DISPOSITION: Home with VNA services.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Satisfactory.COMPLICATIONS DURING THIS HOSPITAL STAY: None.TO DO/FOLLOWUP PLAN:1. The patient should follow up with her PCP in 1-2 weeks.2. The patient should follow up with Dr. Bodenstein in the EndocrineDepartment in 2-4 weeks. She can be reached at 842-444-3923.3. The patient should aggressively increase her oral waterintake in order to keep her sodium within normal limits.4. The patient should call her doctor if she has any changes inher mental status or if she develops nausea , vomiting , abdominalpain , rash , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , or any otherworrisome symptoms.5. Of note , the patient's biopsy sutures on her left abdomen andright forearm were removed on the day of discharge. These areasappear to have healed well. Her central line was also removed on3/9/05 without complications.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.2. Hydrocortisone 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 4 doses starting in thea.m. of 9/10/05 .3.

The patient's cardiac risk factors are diabetes ,hypertension , distant smoking history. There is no history ofincreased cholesterol and no family history of heart disease. Thepatient noted the onset of exertional shortness of breath aroundthe beginning of 10 of October .  At that time the patient was experiencingincreased stress because of the recent death of the patient'ssister-in-law. The patient consulted his local physician , Dr.Bret Langner , on 14 of October .  An EKG at that time showed no changefrom an EKG of a year earlier. Over the next week the patientreported feeling weak , general malaise , experienced occasionalchills with continuing dyspnea on exertion. There was one event on7 of July where the patient experienced chest pain with severediaphoresis and a chill which he attributed to the flu although thepatient did not seek medical attention at that time. Over the last10 to 14 days prior to admission the patient noted increasingexertional dyspnea , three episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspneaassociated with right chest discomfort. There was no nausea ,vomiting , diaphoresis , cyanosis. The patient also noted edema inhis lower extremities over the last two weeks. The last episode ofparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea was this past weekend. On the day ofadmission the patient saw Dr. Mugrage once again and EKGdemonstrated marked anterolateral changes that were new since theEKG taken on 14 of October .  The patient presented to the Lacon Hospital Emergency Ward. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significantfor hypertension of approximately 10 years , non-insulin dependentdiabetes mellitus of approximately 12 years , left Bell's palsy in1985 treated with prednisone , type IV hypolipoproteinemia. Thepatient was also admitted for right face and arm pain at theSkastem, Medical Center in 21 of April .  This was attributed to TIA. Carotidnon-invasives at that time along with a head CT were reportedlynegative. The patient also had a right cranial nerve III palsy in30 of August .  MEDICATIONS: Micronase 10 mg po bid , Persantine 60 mg potid , aspirin one po q d , Lisinopril 5 mg po q d , and Atenolol 50 mgpo q d. ALLERGIES: None known. SOCIAL HISTORY: There isapproximately 20 pack year history of smoking. The patient quitcigarettes 20 years ago. Ethanol history was social. The patientis married , has two grown children. He currently works in a shortterm storage warehouse office , apparently recently lost his tobaccoshop business and there is certainly a potential stress regardinghis employment situation and recent death of his sister-in-lawfollowing a prolonged illness. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reportshis parents are still living , has single sibling who is alive andwell. He denies family history of coronary artery disease ,hypertension or diabetes. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Non-contributory.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a thin white male in noacute distress sitting up on the stretcher.Vital signs demonstrated he was afebrile , blood pressure 140/90 ,pulse 88 , respirations 18. His room air O2 sat was 96%. HEENTexam normocephalic , atraumatic. Left pupil was 5 mm and contractedto 3; right pupil was 4 mm and contracted to 3. His extraocularmovements were intact. Fundi were poorly visualized secondary topossible partial cataract. Oropharynx was only remarkable forextensive upper bridge work. Neck was supple , no adenopathy. Hiscarotids were 1+ bilaterally without bruits. His chest exam wasremarkable for decreased breath sounds halfway up , right greaterthan left , with absent breath sounds at the bases. The chest wasdull to percussion halfway up , however , there were no rales ,wheezes or rhonchi noted. Cardiac exam revealed jugular venouspulse was approximately 7 cm at 30 degrees , regular rate andrhythm , S1 and S2 with loud S4 , otherwise no murmur or rub.Abdominal exam demonstrated bowel sounds were present , non-tender ,liver span 8 cm in midclavicular line. There was no spleen tippalpable. Rectal exam normal tone with a firm prostate withoutmasses and stool was guaiac negative. Back exam revealed no spinalor CVA tenderness noted. There was slight buffalo hump present ,however. Extremities - Radial pulses 3+ , femoral 2+ , posteriortibial 2+ on the right and 1+ on the left , dorsal pedis 1+bilaterally. There are no femoral bruits. There was 1+ pittingankle edema bilaterally. Neuro exam was non-focal.LABORATORY DATA: On admission sodium 141 , potassium 4.6 , chloride105 , CO2 24 , BUN 19 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 178.ALT 20 , AST 18 , LDH 177. CK 107. Alk phos 98 , bili total 0.5 ,direct 0.2. Cholesterol 236 , triglycerides 320. Total protein7.0 , globulin 4.6 , albumin 2.4 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 3.8. Whitecount 6.6 , Hct 39.8 , platelets 260 , 000 , three point differentialrevealed 26% lymphocytes , 5.8% monocytes , 68.2% granulocytes. PTwas 12.6 , PTT 31.0. UA was pending. EKG showed normal sinusrhythm at a rate of 84 , PR interval 160 , QRS 84 , QTC 0.44 , axis+30. The EKG was remarkable for Q wave in T and F and extensivelyacross the precordium , T wave inversions in 1 , 2 , and R. STelevations of 2 to 3 mm in V2 , V3 , and V4 with T wave inversion inV2 through V6 , all of these changes new since 21 of April .  Portablechest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions with fluid inthe minor fissures , question of cardiomegaly , increasing pulmonaryvascular redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General MedicalService Ri Jotonmavilleceance Lisker and subsequently ruled out for MIby enzymes. His initial CK was 107. Eight hours later his CKdrawn was 45 and final CK was 89. However , the patient underwentechocardiography and the echocardiogram demonstrated a moderatelydilated left ventricle with decreased global contractile function ,roughly estimated at around 25%. There were extensive wall motionabnormalities with mid to distal septal akinesis , anterior ,anterolateral , and septal apex dyskinesis consistent with a largeanterior myocardial infarction. However , there was no muralthrombus seen although occult thrombi could not be excluded at thattime. Because of the echocardiogram result and the fact that thepatient ruled out for a recent MI the clinical picture wasconsistent with an evolved myocardial infarction within the timebetween the patient's initial presentation to Dr. Connelley in 10 of Octoberand the patient's presentation in 16 of October .  Consequently the plan wasmade to manage the patient with gentle Lasix diuresis. Thepatient's beta blocker was held because of the concern for wallmotion abnormalities and possible aneurysm formation. The patientwas anticoagulated on heparin and subsequently was loaded onCoumadin. In addition the patient's afterload reduction wasincreased and changed to Captopril. In addition the patientunderwent an exercise tolerance test with thallium scan on1 of November .  During this procedure the patient exercised for 6minutes on modified Bruce protocol. The test was stopped secondaryto leg fatigue. The patient's heart rate rose from 98 to 150 ,blood pressure rose from 126/72 to 148/76. The patient had nochest pain. There was no evidence for ischemia. Thallium imagesshowed a moderately severe perfusion defect at the apex sustainedto the low anterior wall , inferolateral wall , and septum. Thisdefect was unchanged on late images. There were , therefore , nosigns of ischemia , however , there was some mild transient loss ofuptake consistent with CHF. The overall impression was of a fixeddefect consistent with an evolved myocardial infarction. Becauseof the evidence for an evolved myocardial infarction the decisionwas made that this patient would not be a candidate for coronaryartery bypass grafting and so cardiac catheterization was deferredat this time. The patient was discharged to home on 16 of April .  Atthe time of discharge a UA and sediment were pending.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Lasix 40 mg po q d , Captopril37.5 mg po tid , Ecotrin 325 mg po q d , Coumadin 5 mgpo q h.s. , magnesium oxide two tablets po q d , Isordil 10 mg po tidwith meals , and Micronase 10 mg po bid.

Oropharynx is clear. Mucous membranes aremoist. NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 ,S2 no murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. The patient hasdiminished dorsalis pedis pulse on the left side; otherwise ,peripheral pulses are intact. CHEST: Clear to auscultationbilaterally; crackles bilaterally at the bases. ABDOMEN: Obese ,soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis or edemanoted. There is a 1 cm abrasion at the right shin , bruising overthe right shin and dorsal aspect of the foot. NEURO: Alert andoriented times three. There is a right lower facial droop;otherwise cranial nerves II through XII intact. Motor is 5/5 inall extremities; sensory is intact throughout to light touch.LABORATORY: Sodium 138 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 100 , bicarb 26 ,BUN 16 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 305. WBC 12.7 ,hematocrit 36.1 , platelets 327. Troponin I is 0; CK 216. Chestx-ray is negative. CT of head is negative. EKG shows normal sinusrhythm at rate of 117. There is a right bundle branch block andleft anterior fascicular block present. There are also Q waves inlateral leads V4 through V6.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the general medicalservice for evaluation of syncope. She wasmonitored over the weekend and no arrhythmias were picked up oncardiac monitor. The patient underwent echocardiography whichshowed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of80%. There were no wall motion abnormalities. There was also notedmild left atrial enlargement and mild aortic valve sclerosis. Dueto the worrisome nature of patient's history of angina-likesymptoms , she went directly to cardiac catheterization , whichrevealed heavily calcified LAD and RCA. The LAD showed proximalstenosis of 30 to 40% , circumflex showed proximal stenosis of 30%and the RCA showed proximal stenosis of 30%. It was felt that thisrepresented mild CAD and most likely could not explain the sourceof the patient's syncopal episode. The patient also underwentelectrophysiology study which showed no evidence for ventriculararrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias as cause of syncope. The patientcontinued to have no arrhythmic events on cardiac monitorthroughout her hospital stay. The patient tolerated the cardiaccath well and did well during the postprocedure period. Thepatient's diltiazem was discontinued thinking that it maycontribute to heart block given the fact that she has abifascicular block. THe patient was started on nifedipine XL. Thepatient was discharged home with close follow-up with her primarycare physician , Dr. Mendoca .MEDICATIONS: On discharge , Captopril 75 b.i.d. , Nifedipine XL 90 qd , Lopid 600 b.i.d. , Axid 150 b.i.d. , Lasix 40 q d ,INsulin 70/30 80 q a.m. and 40 q p.m.Dictated By:Attending: MITCH FERDINAND GUBALA , M.D. HN4  IS927/2221Batch: 09211 Index No. C8IEIV038T D: 10/21/98T: 3/9/98CC: DR.

Pulmonary embolism.2. Enterobacter pneumonia.3. MRSA pneumonia.4. Respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:This is a 68-year-old female with diastolic heart failure ,hypertension , and diabetes , who is status post a perforatedduodenal ulcer repaired on 8/13/05 at an outside hospital. Thepatient's course at the outside hospital was complicated byrespiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation andhypotension that required pressor support with Neo-Synephrine.After aggressive diureses , she was extubated and on 5/29/05 , thepatient was transferred to Erverv Medical Center onfacemask. On 4/29/05 , the patient was found to have a leftupper lobe pulmonary embolism on chest CT and was started onheparin drip. At that time , a chest tube was placed for removal of leftpleural effusion. Upon manipulation of the chest tubes , thepatient was noted to desaturate and required intubation.Bronchoscopy was performed with copious secretions.Echocardiogram on 4/29/05 showed moderate pericardial effusionand evidence of right ventricular strain. At this time , thepatient was transferred to the CCU for further care.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Diabetes.2. Diastolic heart failure.3. Hypertension.4. Hyperlipidemia.5. Osteoarthritis.6.

Thepatient was ventilated on assist control , tidal volume 400 ,respiratory rate of 14 , overbreathing at 27 , PEEP of 10 with PIPof 33 , saturating 92% on 95% FiO2. Physical examination revealeda patient who was intubated and only mildly responsive tostimuli. The patient's cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2 ,a possible S4 with no evidence of murmur. Her JVP was notassessable at the time of transfer. Pulmonary exam revealed thelungs that were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomenwas soft. The patient grimaces with deep palpation to the rightlower quadrant. Her extremities were warm with no evidence ofrash and good pulses.LABORATORY DATA:Labs at the time of transfer to the CCU revealed a white cellcount of 13.3 , hematocrit of 30.8 , a platelet count of 200 , 000.Sodium 141 , potassium 4.5 , bicarbonate 31 , BUN 13 , creatinine of0.5 , and glucose 131. PTT was 32.6 , INR 1.4. LFTs were normalother than a mildly elevated total bilirubin at 1.1. CK was 27.MB was 0.4. Troponin was 0.22.STUDIES PERFORMED DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:The patient had a chest CT on 4/29/05 that revealed left upperlobe and lingular branch pulmonary embolism , but no evidence ofDVT. Her most recent chest CT done on 6/21/06 revealedsegmental atelectasis involving the posterior basaland lateral basal segments of the left lower lobe , minimalleft-sided effusion , and slight improvement of opacities inthe upper lobe due to improving pneumonia. Abdominal CTon 4/29/05 , revealed no evidence of free intraperitoneal gas orextravasation of oral contrast to suggest persistent bowelperforation. There was a small to moderate amount of asciteswith a more localized 2.5 cm phlegmonous area in the rightpericolic gutter , not amenable to percutaneous drainage. Followup abdominal CT on 9/6/06 , revealed decreased splenicsubcapsular hematoma and enlarged bilateral ovaries.Transvaginal ultrasound on 8/26/06 revealed mildly enlarged andlobular right ovary with the size of 3 x 3 x 2.7 cm.IMPRESSION:A 68-year-old woman with diabetes , hypertension , who presented toan outside hospital with duodenal bleed on 9/29/06 , requiringgram patch repair , complicated postoperatively by volumeoverload , hypotension , pulmonary embolism , Enterobacterpneumonia , and coag-negative Staph bacteremia.HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:1. Infectious disease:A. Enterobacter pneumonia: The patient completed a 14-daycourse of imipenem for Enterobacter pneumonia. Chest CT on10/22/05 showed resolving pneumonia. Sputum culture from8/7/06 , revealed Enterobacter and MRSA. The sputum culturesthrough 7/21/06 showed persistent Enterobacter. As the patientwas persistently febrile and repeat CT showed new left upper lobeatelectasis with a question of infiltrate and bilateral groundglass opacities , the patient was restarted on imipenem with theaddition of linezolid per recommendation of the InfectiousDisease consult team. The patient completed a full course ofimipenem on 4/5/06 , and a full course of linezolid on 1/1/06 .Chest x-ray performed on 1/10/06 revealed no evidence ofconsolidation.B. Pseudomonas pneumonia: The patient had a urine culture on7/21/06 that grew 100 , 000 colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.The patient was initially placed on gentamicin; however , this wasswitched to levofloxacin on 10/6/06 and then ciprofloxacin on7/25/06 based on microbiologic susceptibilities. The patientcompleted a full course of ciprofloxacin on 4/5/06 .C. Enterococcus bacteremia: Blood culture on 10/19/06 grewvancomycin susceptible Enterococcus. The patient completed a14-day course of linezolid.D. Candidal intertrigo: The patient was put on topicalantifungals with failure to improve candidal skin infection. Shewas started on fluconazole 100 mg p.o. daily on 8/26/06 . Shewill complete a seven-day course on 10/28/06 .2. Pulmonary: The patient had a prolonged course of ventilatordependence. A tracheostomy was performed on 6/26/05 . Thepatient was successfully weaned to trach collar on 7/25/06 . Hertrach collar was capped on 1/10/06 and the patient has beentolerating oxygen via nasal cannula since that point.3. Heme:A. Pulmonary embolism: The patient was found to have left upperlobe and lingular branch pulmonary emboli. As discussed above ,she was initially on heparin , which was discontinued on 8/7/06 .The patient was found to be subtherapeutic on her Coumadin on7/23/06 , and was initiated on Lovenox as a bridge at that time.Lovenox was continued until 4/5/06 . At the time of discharge ,the patient's Coumadin dose is 3 mg p.o. at bedtime. Her INR was2.7 on 1/1/06 . Please continue to monitor and adjust doseaccordingly. There was some concern for possible right upperextremity DVT during this hospitalization given the appearance ofright upper extremity swelling. Non-invasive studies werenegative for evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.B. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient was found to have aniron less than assay on 8/6/06 , a TIBC of 181 , and ferritin of828. She was started on ferrous sulfate. Her hematocrit hasbeen stable with the transfusion goal less than 27.4. Cardiovascular:A. Ischemia: No active issues.B. Pump: The patient had an echocardiogram done on 4/13/05 ,revealing normal LV function and size , and an ejection fractionof 55-60% , no akinesis , mild right ventricular enlargement ,moderate right ventricular global dysfunction , normal leftatrium , and right atrium , normal valves , and small circumscribedpericardial effusion. The patient had evidence of fluid overloadon transfer to this hospital. She has been successfully diureseddown to her dry weight of 100 kg. She was recently ontorsemide 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. that has been weaned off due toconcerns of increasing BUN and bicarbonate in the setting ofaggressive diureses. Please continue to monitor weights and dosetorsemide for concern of worsening fluid overload.C. Rhythm: The patient has had a tachycardia , thought to besecondary to fever and pulmonary embolism. Her heart rate theday prior to discharge was 87-104.5. Gynecologic: The patient has bilateral enlarged ovaries onabdominal CT , confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound on 8/26/06 ,revealing a mildly enlarged and lobular right ovary with the sizeof 3 x 3 x 2.7 cm. The patient has a known history of enlargedovary , and comparison will need to be made with prior pelvicultrasounds as an outpatient. Recommended further outpatientevaluations to rule out ovarian malignancy.6. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient wasswitched on 8/26/06 , on tube feeds of Jevity to increase thefiber per recommendations of the nutrition consult team. We havebeen continuing the free water boluses for mild hypernatremia.The patient has a history of mild pill dysphagia and esophagogramduring this hospitalization revealed mild-to-moderate esophagealdysmotility.7. Endocrine: The patient has been followed by the Endocrineconsult team during the hospitalization for monitoring of bloodsugars. She has a tendency to become hypoglycemic when her tubefeeds are turned off. Please continue to monitor glucosefingersticks every six hours.8. Neurologic: We added Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. at bedtime and asneeded for anxiety or agitation. We also have added Klonopin 1mg p.o. at bedtime.9. Renal: As noted above , the patient has an elevated BUN tocreatinine ratio consistent with prerenal azotemia. We have heldall diuretic agents , this will need to be monitored in the rehabsetting.10. GI: The patient is constipated. She is on a bowel regimenof Colace and senna with p.r.n. lactulose. She was disimpacted1/10/06 . She has a chronic pill dysphagia as discussed above.11. The patient seen by the Dermatology consult service on4/5/06 for concern of a blanching erythematous rash on her midback , buttocks , upper thighs , groin area , and around her pannus.The Dermatology consult team felt that this was most consistentwith a drug hypersensitivity eruption. As the timing of therash was unclear , it makes it difficult to determine theoffending agents. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics ,which are likely offenders and has been discontinued as thecourses were completed. The rash is fairly limited and appearsto be improving at the time of discharge. Please continueclobetasol 0.05% cream twice a day to the effected areas withpramoxine 1% lotion three times a day , and Sarna lotion as neededfor pruritus. Okay to stop these medications when the rash hasresolved. The patient is in satisfactory condition at the timeof discharge. She is full code.DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA:At the time of discharge , her laboratories were as follows:Sodium 135 , potassium 3.8 , bicarbonate 39 , BUN 80 , creatinine0.7 , and glucose 60.

His cardiac risk factors included hypertension ,cigarette smoking and a family history; no diabetes or cholesterol.In 3/23 , he sustained an IMI complicated by V-tach , cardiogenicshock and Dresler's. He was discharged on digoxin and Lasix. Hesubsequently did well with chest pain only on extreme exertioncharacterized by retrosternal burning which radiated to his leftarm with shortness of breath. It did not occur at rest. He sawDr. Luthi who prescribed Isordil with much decrement in symptoms.In 8/13 , he was found to be hypertensive with decrease in T-4. Hewas treated with captopril and Synthroid. In 6/8 , he had newonset of atrial fibrillation. He was treated with Quinaglute. In7/4 , he noted dizziness with decreased vision episodically. Hewas treated with the discontinuation of captopril and digoxin wasbegun. Atrial fibrillation was again documented on a Holter.On 6/8/90 , he was admitted to Onlanfalls Health with atrialfibrillation. The quinidine level was 1.6 and digoxin level 0.8 ,T-4 9.2. The heart rate was 64 , blood pressure 110/90. He ruledout for an MI. He was treated with an increase in his quinidinesulfate. His course was complicated by a five second pause. A DDDpacer was placed. He continued to have light-headedness withoutassociated arrhythmias. An echo revealed an ejection fraction of30% with inferior akinesis , left ventricular hypertrophy and asmall pericardial effusion. While in the hospital , he had twoepisodes of chest pain which were abated by nitroglycerin. Therewere no brady or tachy arrhythmias noted at the times of the chestpain. He was off Isordil. The chest pain occurred with walking.There was no chest pain since restarting Isordil. On the monitorhe was noted to be in normal sinus rhythm with a first degree heartblock and occasional atrial fibrillation. The T-4 value was 9.2.PAST HISTORY: Cholecystectomy in 1983; hypertension; decreasedT-4; meningitis as a child. ALLERGIES: None known.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Heart rate 65; blood pressure 120/90;temperature 97.5. The HEENT exam wasunremarkable. Carotids 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.The lungs were clear. The cardiac exam revealed a regular rate andrhythm; S1 and S2; no S3; II/VI systolic murmur at the left uppersternal border radiating to the apex; no rubs; PMI nondisplaced;JVD 6 cm. The abdomen revealed a cholecystectomy scar. Theextremities revealed strong pulses and no bruits. The neuro examwas nonfocal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: White count 9.4; hematocrit 42;platelets 390; sodium 143; potassium 5.2;chloride 107; CO2 30; BUN 26; creatinine 1.8; glucose 90; PT 12.6;PTT 29.8; quinidine level 3; calcium 9.2. The EKG revealed dualchamber 100% paced; no atrial activity; rate 65; intervals 0.16 ,0.20 and 0.50. An EKG from 10/7 revealed sinus brady at 50;intervals 0.22 , 0.12; appropriate QTC; left atrial hypertrophy.Urinalysis was notable for a specific gravity of 1.025 , pH 5 ,presence of urate crystals. The chest x-ray showed no CHF orinfiltrate; cardiomegaly as well as a dual chamber pacer present.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology Hassteam. The Metteand Health Center team preferred to stop theQuinidex at this time and observe him for recurrence of atrialfibrillation with plans to start Norpace if this occurred. Therewas no recurrence of atrial fibrillation while in-house. The DDDremained in place with settings as per the admission note. He hada cardiac work up consisting of an echocardiogram revealing anejection fraction of 30% with inferior and apical hypokinesisconsistent with location of the old MI. He was maintained onIsordil and atenolol as part of his admission regimen withoutsymptoms while in-house. On the prior to discharge , he underwent astandard Bruce ETT. He exercised nine minutes stopping secondaryto fatigue with a peak heart rate of 105; blood pressure increasedfrom 100/80 to 124/78. There were no ST-T wave changes frombaseline. He was thought to be maximally medicated. His pulsepressure product at rest was excellent and well maintained , and hewas asymptomatic. He was maintained on his current cardiacregimen.He was noted to have a mildly elevated BUN at 26 and creatinine 1.8on admission. He was found to have urate crystals in his urine.His BUN decreased to 23 and creatinine 1.3 prior to discharge. Wewill consider alkalyzing his urine if we suspect a true uratenephropathy.DISPOSITION: He was discharged to home on 1/19/90 . MEDICATIONS ONDISCHARGE: Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; atenolol 50 mgp.o. b.i.d.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.3. ASYSTOLE.4.

History of polysubstance abuse includingIV drug abuse , internasal cocaine , history of hepatitis C ,history of depression , celiac sprue , history of insulin-dependentdiabetes mellitus , chronic renal insufficiency with a baselinecreatinine ranging from 1.8-2.4 , history of bipolar disorder ,history of non-ST elevation MI with a negative stress test in10/29 , who presents on May , 2005 after sustaining a fallat home. Patient lives on the third floor of his building andhas difficulty secondary to dyspnea on exertion with ambulationup steps. Per patient , patient was walking up steps and feltincreasing dyspneic and secondary experience a fall. EMS wasnotified and patient was brought to the Hey County Hospital .  Upon presentation to the Sman Hospital , patient reportsother additional symptoms of CHF exacerbation includingprogressive dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnaldyspnea and cough productive of yellow phlegm dating back to mostrecent discharge from hospital on March , 2004 when patientwas admitted for similar complaint of CHF exacerbation. Patientwith multiple , multiple admissions in the last year to two yearssecondary to CHF exacerbation with exacerbations felt to besecondary to medication noncompliance as well as dietarydiscretion.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As stated.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include Lasix 100 mg t.i.d. , RegularInsulin sliding scale , lisinopril 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Ativan 0.5 mgq.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , spironolactone25 mg p.o. q.d. , amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o.q.d. , Lantus 15 units SC q.h.s. , Protonix 400 mg p.o. q.d.ALLERGIES: Patient with allergies to multiple medicationsincluding aspirin , codeine , tetracycline , NSAIDs , ibuprofen ,Benadryl , Compazine , penicillin. Additionally of note , patientshould not receive beta-blockage given history of cocaine abuseand ongoing cocaine use.SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient lives on the third floor of hisapartment building. Former tobacco user. Patient refused todiscuss polysubstance abuse at the time of admission.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION: Patient was afebrile at 96 , pulse of84 , blood pressure 150/99 , respiratory rate of 20 , O2 sat 100% onroom air. Patient was quite combative on admission , though it isunclear exactly the etiology of the patient's agitation.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for elevatedjugular venous pressure with pulsation observant the ear at 90degrees , estimated approximately 18 cm of water. Patientaddition with rales approximately one-half to two-thirds upbilaterally on chest exam. Cardiac exam: Patient regular rateand rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops were appropriated.Patient's lower extremities were felt to be warm andwell-perfused with 2+ lower extremity edema to the hipsbilaterally.LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for sodium of 127 ,hyponatremia felt to be secondary to chronic CHF exacerbation.Potassium of 5.1 , bicarb of 19 , creatinine elevated at 2.6 upfrom baseline of 1.8 , glucose elevated at 377 , hematocrit stableat 34.5 and BNP was recorded on admission at greater than assay.EKG on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm with a heart rateof approximately80 with T-wave inversion in V5-V6 which were similar to priorechocardiograms. Chest x-ray obtained on admission revealedpulmonary vascular congestion with flank pulmonary edema andbilateral pleural effusions. No infiltrate was appreciated. Assuch , patient was admitted for evaluation and management of CHFexacerbation. CHF was felt to be secondary to medication anddietary noncompliance as previously mentioned.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Cardiovascular:A. Ischemia: Patient with no evidence for chest pain orischemic injury. At the time of admission , CHF exacerbation notfelt to be due to recurrent ischemia but rather medicationindiscretion. Of note , patient with multiple prior troponinleaks ranging from 0.10 to 0.12 on prior admissions. Not felt tobe secondary to ischemia necessarily but rather due secondary toelevated filling pressures.B. Pump: Patient with decompensated heart failure on admissionnot felt to be in a low cardiac output state but rather justvolume overloaded. Patient was subsequently diuresed using bothIV Lasix and p.o. torsemide. At the time of discharge , patientfelt to be relatively euvolemic though will likely requirefurther outpatient evaluation and ongoing diuresis given hiscontinued congestive heart failure. Patient with difficultyadhering to a 2 liter per day fluid-restriction diet , wouldrecommend further nutritional outpatient evaluation andcounseling regarding his fluid status given poor cardiacfunction. At the time of discharge , patient on 100 mg oftorsemide b.i.d. with relatively good urine output and I/O ofapproximately negative 0.5 to 1 kg per day , would recommendintensive outpatient CHF management including multidisciplinaryapproach using heart failure nursing. Patient advised to usescale and record daily weight , that there have been issues in thepast with compliance. Additionally , patient's Aldactone wasdiscontinued secondary to hyperkalemia and instead patient wasstarted on Isordil/hydralazine for hemodynamic support.C. Rhythm: Patient stable from the perspective , maintained ontele monitoring with no events over his hospital course.2. Renal: Patient with acute renal failure on admission withcreatinine elevated to 2.6. With ongoing diuresis and correctionof volume overload , patient's creatinine corrected to a baselinevalue. At the time of discharge , patient's creatinine was 2.0.Recommend rehab monitoring of renal function including creatinineand BUN every three days until patient on a stable dose oftorsemide and felt to be euvolemic , given concern or risk foracute renal failure during ongoing diuresis.3. Endocrine: Patient with a history of insulin-dependentdiabetes maintained on Lantus with Regular Insulin sliding scaleper outpatient regimen.4. Psych: Patient with a history of bipolar disorder ,maintained on Depakote.

Patient will require further aggressive outpatient CHFmanagement including ongoing diuresis using p.o. torsemide.Patient does put out well to p.o. torsemide , though of note hedoes have compliance issues with regards to daily fluid intake.2. Additionally , would recommend further titration ofhydralazine and Isordil to maximize hemodynamic support.3. Additionally , given hyperkalemia on admission with peakpotassium reaching 6.0 , patient's lisinopril and spironolactoneheld at the time of discharge. Would recommend reinstitution ofpatient's ACE inhibitor particularly as an outpatient withlow-dose lisinopril perhaps starting at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. withintensive monitoring of potassium.4. Additionally , would recommend further diabetic teaching as anoutpatient given patient's poor compliance.5. Strongly feel patient would benefit from involvement in a CHFprogram either through Gon Ce orthrough other program.FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT: Patient to follow up with primary carephysician , Dr. Marion Salser , at the Pressou Healthcare Center .

She wasdischarged from GMS to rehab on January after being admittedfor shortness of breath and treated as a COPD flare with one weekof azithromycin , prednisone taper and nebulizer treatments. Shewas discharged with good O2 sats in the 90s on two liters ( herhome O2 requirement is 2 liters ). Now she presents withworsening shortness of breath , night sweats and cough which isproductive. She denies chest pain , palpitations ,lightheadedness , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea. She also finished acourse of levofloxacin after an admit from July to 2 of May forsimilar symptoms.She was transferred from the Landchi Vier Community Hospital to Townfaxt Medical Center ED withvital signs at that time were 99.5 , heart rate of 120 , bloodpressure of 105/35 , and a respiratory rate of 36 , and 81% on roomair and 86% on 5 liters. She received 1 mg of Ativan , 5 duonebs ,500 mg IV of clindamycin , 500 mg of levofloxacin. Her ABG atthat time was 7.32/82/113 . Her troponin was 0.13 and her BNP was29. It was thought that she required ICU care and since no bedswere available at Morei Horan Winblo Health Center , she was transferred to theCeville Tianfaulkharb Medical Center . Her vital signs on admission include a heart rate of110 , a blood pressure of 190/55 , respiratory rate of 32 and sats87 to 89% on 4 liters , going up to 95% on 6 liters. She receivedvancomycin 1.5 IV x1 , albuterol and Atrovent nebs stack as wellas aspirin.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for COPD/asthma with lastpulmonary function tests in October 2005 showing an FVC of 41% ,FEV1 of 0.74 liters , 33% , and a ratio of FEV1/FVC of 83%. Also ,schizoaffective disorder/questionable bipolar , GERD , diabetes ,CHF with EF of 30% , and an echo in October 2005 , hypertensionand steroid myopathy.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:1. Aspirin 325.2.

Levalbuterol 1.25 t.i.d.27. Lasix 80.ALLERGIES: Penicillin , sulfa.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone but has husband who is involvedin her care. Attends Geri-day program three times per week.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Heart rate of 105 , bloodpressure 98/64. Sat of 94% on six liters. On general exam , shewas morbidly obese , working to breathe , speaking in phrases.Wanting water. Respiratory distress. HEENT: Tearing eyes.Sclerae anicteric. Extraocular muscles intact. Oropharynx wasclear. Chest with very poor air movement. It was end expiratorywheezes throughout. Her cardiovascular: JVP not visualizedsecondary to body habitus. Tachycardic. Distant heart sounds.Abdomen was soft , obese , nontender , nondistended. Herextremities: There was 2+ edema to the knee level.LABS: Remarkable labs on admission include a creatinine of 1.7 ,a bicarb of 38 , her BNP was 29 , troponin was 0.13. Her crit was32.4 , white blood count 7.6 , and platelets 267. On thedifferential her white blood count was 93 polys , no bands. Coagswere within normal limits. Her UA was ??__??. EKG showed sinustachycardia 106 , some T-wave inversions in lead 1 , someflattening in lead 5 , but essentially unchanged from prior.Chest x-ray: Portable AP view with stable cardiomegaly ,questionable of lower lobe infiltrate but no evidence of CHF.ANALYSIS AND PLAN: On admission , this is a 59-year-old femalewith history of recent COPD and asthma exacerbation , diabetes ,CHF , who presents with worsening shortness of breath andsuspected right middle lobe pneumonia.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Pulmonary: The patient presented with hypercarbic , hypoxemicrespiratory distress , most likely secondary to a recurrentpneumonia in the setting of her baseline obstructive/restrictivepulmonary disease. She was not found to be volume overloaded onadmission , and she had a D-Dimer that was negative as well. Herrestrictive lung disease is most likely secondary to her bodyhabitus leading to obesity hyperventilation syndrome and herobstructive disease have components of asthma since hasresponsive bronchodilation after beta-agonist. The management ofher respiratory status involved initially starting on steroids ,prednisone 60 mg , frequent nebs , as well as continuing her Advairand Singulair. It was also planned to use BiPAP since she mighthave sleep apnea component despite no objective data supportingthat. She on second day of hospital stay , was under increasedrespiratory distress. A repeat blood gas showed a pH of 7.27 , aPCO2 of 88 , and a PO2 of 82 on 50% of O2. Since clinicallypatient was deteriorating , it was decided that she would benefitof intubation. The patient was intubated on May and wasplaced on AC mode. On ventilation , the patient initiallyrequired AC since she was not able to maintain good total volumeson pressure support. Multiple times that it was attempted towean her off the ventilator , she developed increased respiratorydistress and decreased total volume with ventilator mechanicsshowing increased airway resistance. Despite frequent nebs , shewas unable to be weaned off the ventilator. On January , aftermultiple attempts , it was decided that she would benefit fromlongterm ventilatory support. She underwent a PEG andtracheostomy placement by Dr. Rosaro with no complications. SinceJanuary , her ventilatory settings were decreased to pressuresupport with peep of 5 and a pressure support of 10. She had tworecurrent episodes of increased respiratory distress when movedin bed. It was suspected that her respiratory distress wasrelated to a mechanical obstruction of her tracheostomy and priorto discharge , she will be getting a different trach recommendedby surgery which will minimize this mechanical obstruction.Otherwise , she is currently on 40% of FIO2 and a peep of 5 ,pressure support of 12 and at those settings she is getting tidalvolumes in the range from 380 to 450 and O2 sats between 98 and100%.2. ID: Her chest x-ray had a suspected right middle lobeinfiltrate in addition to the fever and increased white bloodcount. It was decided that she would benefit from nosocomialpneumonia coverage. Her first course of antibiotics includedlevo , clinda. , as well as vancomycin. Cultures of her sputum andblood were sent , were negative. Her sputum cultures just greworal flora and her blood cultures initially were all negative buton January , she had a positive culture for staph. , guaiacnegative , in the setting of a central venous line. It wasthought at that moment that she had secondary infection which wasMSSE line infection and all lines were pulled and she wascontinued on vancomycin for another 14 days. Her antibioticswere switched to ceftaz. , azithromycin , clindamycin andvancomycin. She received a total of 21 days of antibiotics andprior to discharge had finished her ceftaz. and Flagyl. She alsoreceived a 14 day course of vancomycin after the central venouslines were removed and since then she has been afebrile and allblood cultures after October have been negative , so about 10days with negative blood cultures and sputum cultures.Just prior to discharge , her left IJ line will be removed sinceshe just finished her course of antibiotics as well as herperipheral A line.Endocrine: The patient received high dose of steroids ,prednisone 60 mg , for about two weeks and had a couple ofattempts to decrease the prednisone but responded with increasedbroncho-resistance on ventilator measurements and it was decidedto keep her at a higher dose. The week prior to admission , aslow tapering was started with 50 mg for 5 days , then 50 mg foranother 4 days and on discharge , she was on the transition pointto 30 mg. She was getting calcium carbonate and vitamin D forosteoporosis prevention. Her diabetes was managed with Lantus100 units a day with Portland Insulin Protocol on initial ICUstay transitioned to Regular Insulin scale. She was not needingany extra insulin units prior to discharge.Cardiovascular:A. Ischemia: The patient had recent workup for CAD includingCath which was negative , but she did have an elevation troponinwhich was likely secondary to demand ischemia with spontaneousresolution. She was continued on aspirin. There was no anginaor new changes in EKG during this admission.B. Pump: She looked slightly volume overloaded on admission.She received Lasix80 IV b.i.d. and her diuretic regimen was titrated and she mightneed , once discharged ,a standing dose of Lasix to maintain her I's and O's goal even.Her blood pressure off the ACE inhibitor on hospital stay rangedbetween 112 and 130. We plan to restart her on a small-dose ACEinhibitor prior to discharge with the objective of better bloodpressure control as well as renal protection from her diabetes.We will not restart Isordil since patient had no evidence ofcoronary artery disease.Psych: We will continue home regimen of Trileptal , Depakote aswell as Risperdal.Heme: Her hematocrit has remained stable during this admission.Since she was getting multiple blood draws , she received about 2units of packed red blood cells and all her workup for a sourceof anemia was negative including vitamin B12 , including ironstudies as well. Her heme ?__? panel was also negative.Musculoskeletal: Patient had an infiltrative ?___? on her leftarm around her peripheral IV access. The infiltration lead to alarge ulcer which was managed by Plastics. They recommended onlyb.i.d. dressing changes. There were no signs of evidentinfection in the site and healing since that event has been quitegood. There are some signs of granulation tissue in the ulcerbase but no erythema or pus around it. Physical Therapy hasbeen involved in the case and have been doing tremendous work inputting her sitting upright , as well as gaining increasedstrength on her extremity. She is still unable to raise her armagainst gravity but she has 2/5 muscle strength throughout andshe will likely need intensive rehab once she is discharged.FEN: She had a metabolic test performed which yielded a measureresting energy expender of 2121 kilocalories a day and apredicted basal metabolic rate of 1771 kilocalories a day. Thoseresults yielded to an increase in her tube feedings which areconsisted of Osmolite 1.2 at 70 cc an hour.eScription document: 0-8247167 MCSDictated By: HARGITT , ARTHURAttending: OAKDEN , JEFFRYDictation ID 3474077D: 3/8/05T: 3/8/05

The patient is a retired farm worker.ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Ciprofloxacin , Ceftin , andSingulair.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:1. Lopressor 25 orally every 6 hours.2. Diltiazem 125 mg orally daily.3. Aspirin 325 mg orally daily.4. Furosemide 20 mg orally daily.5. Methylprednisolone 30 mg IV every 8 hours.6. Atorvastatin 80 mg orally daily.7. Allopurinol 100 mg orally daily.8. Ativan 0.5 mg orally at bedtime.9. Nexium 20 mg orally daily.10. Proscar 5 mg orally every night.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs were as follows.Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 73 , blood pressure on the right arm108/59 , and oxygen saturation 98%. HEENT , PERRLA , dentitionwithout evidence of infection , no carotid bruits. On chestexamination , no incisions. Cardiovascular , regular rate andrhythm without murmurs. Respiratory , breath sounds are clearbilaterally. On abdominal exam , bilateral inguinal herniaincisions and enlarged right groin hematoma from previous cardiaccatheterization. On extremities , bilateral lower extremityvaricosities. Neuro exam , the patient was alert and orientedwithout focal deficits.Cardiac catheterization performed at Anon 11/2/06 revealed 30% mid RCA occlusion , 40% distal RCA , 90%ostial OM1 , 90% mid CX , 80% proximal LAD , 99% mid LAD , and 60%mid LM. EKG on 5/5/06 showed a normal sinus rhythm at 76 andan incomplete right bundle-branch block. A chest x-ray on11/2/06 was consistent with congestive heart failure.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's hospital course is as follows bysystems.1. Neurologic: Agitation and delirium. In the immediatepostoperative period , the patient was on alcohol drip , given apreop history of alcohol use. The patient's neurologic statusimproved with the patient being more alert during the day ,particularly with family members present. Haldol was used p.r.n.for agitation during the hospital course.2. Cardiovascular: On 11/27/06 , the patient was taken to theoperating room and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x1with LIMA to LAD , with incomplete revascularization due toinadequate conduit. The patient tolerated the procedure well andafter a period of observation , was transferred to the CardiacSurgery Intensive Care Unit. Subsequently , during the hospitalstay , the patient was started on beta-blockers and statins.Later during the hospital stay , the patient became hypotensive , requiringfluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration.3. Respiratory: The patient was extubated on postoperative daytwo , but he was reintubated for acute respiratory failure later during the daywith subsequent re-extubation on 2/16/07 . During the hospital stay ,the patient had two additional re-intubations for acute respiratory failureevents , one on 11/21/07 followed by extubation on the next day , on 11/17/07 andthe second one on 4/18/07 followed by extubation on 3/23/07 .4. GI: It was characterized by nutrition deficiency , althoughthe patient was able to tolerate soft mechanical diet , the intakewas limited. The puff tubes were placed multiple times foradditional nutrition , but were frequently removed by the patient ,given the delirium and agitation.5. Renal: The patient had good urine output and the electrolyteand creatinine levels were closely monitored.6. Endocrine: Tight glycemic control was maintained withPortland protocol in the immediate postop period and subsequentlywith subcu insulin. The patient was also on prednisone with thepreop indications for COPD and given his postop frequentbronchospastic events.7. Hematologic: The patient was started on aspirin and also onPlavix , given the incomplete coronary vascularization.Hematocrit and platelets were stable.8. Infectious disease: The course was complicated by: A )Sternal wound infection for which the patient underwentpericardial strip advancement on 11/21/07 and omental flap andwound closure on 10/1/07 . The wound was reopened at the bedsideon 7/28/07 by Plastic Surgery due to increased drainage and aVAC sponge was placed. Wound cultures were sent and appropriateantibiotic treatment was instituted. B ) Pneumonias. Treatedinitially empirically and subsequently with specific antibioticsafter culture results became available. C ) Fever , later in thehospital course , the patient experienced fever withoutleukocytosis despite negative cultures. Throughout the hospitalcourse , Infectious Disease Service and Pulmonary Service wereconsulted and they followed the patient continuously.9. Other: Incidental radiologic finding of a renal massconsistent with renal cell carcinoma. Urology Service wasconsulted and the recommendations were made for no interventionat this time.After excessive discussion with the very supportive patient's family withregards to the patient's prognosis , family decision was made to withdrawmedical care and discharge the patient to home with hospice services. Thus , on4/18/07 , the patient was discharged to home after hospice services werearranged.MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE: Were the following.1. Tylenol suppository 650 mg every 6 hours.2. Toradol orally 10 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain.3. Haldol liquid 1 to 3 mg orally every 4 hours as needed foragitation.4. Nexium 20 mg everyday.5. Morphine liquid 5 to 20 mg orally every 2 hours as needed forpain and for shortness of breath.Support for the patient's family was provided throughout thehospital course , and the patient's family was instructed to callhouse officer on call if any question might arise.eScription document: 7-1379911 CSSten TelDictated By: SPAHN , NEWTONAttending: MUDRICK , JAMEYDictation ID 0562557D: 5/20/07T: 5/20/07

The patientwas taken to an outside hospital where his pain dissipated onlyafter sublingual nitroglycerin , then IV nitroglycerin , Lopressor ,Plavix , enoxaparin , and aspirin. At the outside hospital , the CKwas found to be 400 with an MB fraction of 4 percent. A Troponin Twas found to be 0.099 , creatinine was 2.2. Upon arrival to theNoirxas* Community Hospital , the patient had 1/10 chest pain and a blood pressure of195/98 which improved with TNG to 170 systolic and after afterLopressor to 130 systolic.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in1994 and 1995 , status post CABG seven yearsago , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia.ALLERGIES: Penicillin.MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,Zestril 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 80 mg p.o. q.d. ,Lasix 40 mg q.d. , insulin 70/30 40 mg b.i.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was a former smoker who quit 40 yearsago but has an 80 pack year history. He drinksalcohol occasionally. He lives with his wife in Endnai Boulevard , Dumonte , Oregon 38055 ,West VirginiaFAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for coronary arterydisease , however , he does have a family history ofdiabetes mellitus.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , vital signs were atemperature of 96.3 , heart rate 80 , bloodpressure 195/95 , respiratory rate 18 , O2 sats 100 percent on 3liters of oxygen. General , the patient appeared comfortable , in noapparent distress. HEENT , the pupils are equal , round , reactive tolight , extraocular movements are intact , mucous membranes aremoist. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally , cracklesin the lower half of the lung fields bilaterally , no wheezes.Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 normal , no S3 orS4 , positive 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen is soft ,nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds. Extremities , noclubbing , cyanosis , or edema , 2+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally.Neurological exam , nonfocal.LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent labs at the time of admission , thepatient has a creatinine of 2.2 up slightly froma baseline of 1.8. He had a hematocrit of 36.8. CK equal to 417 ,MB equal to 15 , Troponin T equal to 0.09. EKG showed normal sinusrhythm , first-degree AV block , left axis deviation , T waveinversion in aVL , and T wave flattening in lead 1.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Cardiovascular: The patient wasstarted on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor ,Zocor , heparin , and a 2B3A inhibitor before cardiaccatheterization. Zestril was held secondary to marginal renalfunction. Cardiac catheterization on September revealed occlusionof SVG to RCA and SVG to OM. These lesions were treated with atotal of five stents. The last OM manipulation resulted inshowering of plaque and subsequent chest pain and EKG changes ( STelevation in precordial leads ). Following cardiac catheterizationthe patient had no further episodes of chest pain and remainedhemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course. He wassuccessfully diuresed following his acute renal failure.Renal/GU: The patient has a baseline chronic renal insufficiencywith a creatinine of 1.8. Following cardiac catheterization thepatient developed acute renal failure secondary to IV contrast witha creatinine peaking at 6.8 , and then improving gradually to 4.2upon discharge. While in the hospital the patient was followed byRenal and Urology consult team. The patient had developedhematuria while on aspirin , Plavix , heparin , and 2B3A inhibitor.His hematuria resolved gradually. A renal ultrasound demonstratedno evidence of obstruction , but did show several simple cysts , aswell as a calcified cyst which was further evaluated by CT scan ,which demonstrated a likely hyperdense cyst , but follow-up MRI wasrecommended to more definitively rule out the possibility of aneoplasm. Ultrasound showed no evidence of clots in the bladder.Electrolytes were closely followed and adjusted appropriatelyduring the hospital course. The acute renal failure wascomplicated by moderate volume overload in the setting of depressedEF. The patient was continued on Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. Urologyalso recommended an outpatient cystoscopy to rule out tumor versusFoley trauma as the cause of the patient's hematuria.Heme: Following cardiac catheterization , the patient developedepistaxis , frank hematuria , and coffee-ground emesis ( secondary toswallowing blood and not a GI bleed ). The hematocrit fell to 29and the patient was transfused with one unit of packed red bloodcells. Heparin and Tegralen were stopped , the patient wascontinued on aspirin and Plavix. The hematuria resolved , and noclots were seen on abdominal ultrasound. The hematocrit remainedstable throughout the rest of the patient's hospital course.Endocrine: For his diabetes , the patient was maintained on TZIsliding scale while in-house , later was restarted on his homeregimen of insulin 70/30 , and was discharged on this home regimen.DISPOSITION: At the time of discharge the patient was ambulating ,and arrangement were made for the patient to receivea walker for assistance with ambulation.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Discharge medications include aspirin 325mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,hydralazine 30 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 0.4 mg SL q.5 minutes x 3p.r.n. chest pain , Zocor 80 mg p.o. q.h.s. , insulin 70/30 40 unitss.c. b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. q.d.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up includes an appointment with Dr. Auricchio on3/29/02 , cystoscopy with Dr. Sacchetti on 6/17/02 ,abdominal MRI on 3/14/02 , and an appointment with Dr. Neuferwithin one month.Dictated By: LAMAR CURTIS MINASIAN , M.D. BH85Attending: ANDERSON I.

In October , 1995 , she was admitted toElka Hospital with upper respiratory symptoms andprogressive shortness of breath with cardiomegaly. Anechocardiogram at that time revealed an ejection fraction of 15%with global hypokinesis , two to three plus mitral regurgitation anda normal right ventricle. She underwent catheterization whichshowed a right dominates and no coronary artery disease. Anexercise treadmill test scan show maximal VO2 of 12.6 millilitersper kilogram per minute. More recently an echocardiogram inOctober , 1997 , show an injections fraction of 20% with moderatemitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement. She has beenmanaged on Digoxin , diuretics and ACE inhibitors. On this regimenshe continued to have orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea anddyspnea on excretion. She was recently seen by Dr. Sifre in earlyFebruary , 1997 , and give a prescription for Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg. Shedid not take this medication until two days before her admissionand subsequently had brisk diuresis. Over the last week prior toher admission she experienced mild abdominal pain withoutradiation. She had no change in her bowel movements. No bleedingper rectum and no melena but had frequent vomiting. She presentedto the Rin Noa Joneso Memorial Hospital on July , 1997 , with the samesymptoms. Her creatinine was 1.3. Amylase was normal. Anabdominal CT was consistent with pancreatitis. Laboratory studieswere notable for an increased glucose , creatinine of 3.2 onhospital day number two and then subsequently creatinine of 5.5.She continued to have decrease in systolic blood pressure to the70's and was urgently transferred to the Coc Whitpa Valley Hospital on a Dopamine and Insulin drip.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for the following: 1 ) Dilatedcardiomyopathy , 2 ) Adult onset diabetesmellitus , 3 ) History of appendectomy and 4 ) History of ovarian cystremoval.ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Penicillin.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Digoxin .375 q.d. , 2 ) Lasix 160twice a day , 3 ) Captopril 2.5 twice aday , 4 ) K-Dur 40 twice a day , 5 ) Magnesium oxide 1 gram threetimes a day , 6 ) Aspirin once per day , 7 ) DiaBeta 10 twice a dayand 8 ) Zaroxolyn.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a 19 year-old son withcardiomyopathy.

Shewas vigorously hydrated for pancreatitis and had few complications.In setting of her increased abdominal distension and developmentof pleural effusion as well as sudation for ethanol withdrawal sherequired intubation. Throughout her Intensive Care Unit admissionshe had a high fever. An abdominal CT with IV contrast on August , 1997 , was negative for pancreatic necrosis and no tapable fluidscollection. She continued to be febrile as mentioned beforedespite therapy with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , Vancomycin andFlagyl. She intermittently had coagulate negative staphylococcalcultures from her lines which were changed as well as Xanthomonasmaltophilia for which she received Bactrim. At the time of hertransfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the General MedicalService she was usually linked with a baseline heart rate in the120's and a systolic blood pressure in the 90's. The plan was torestart her at low doses of a ACE inhibitor for after loadreduction , as tolerated. With careful surveillance of her fluidstatus and maintenance of weight between 73 and 74 kilograms.Pulmonary wise she was treated for seven days with Bactrim for theXanthomonas infection as well as chest PT daily. Her renalfunction was at her baseline at the time of transfer. InfectiousDiseases as stated above she was treated with Bactrim for sevendays with a plan to reculture if her fever spikes. The patient wastransferred on total parenteral nutrition until she could toleratea p.o. diet.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient's congestiveheart failure improved and she was eubolemicafter extensive diuresis. She was started on high doses of Lasixand then decreased to 80 mg p.o. q.d. with her weight being stablein the 67 kilogram range. She remained tachycardic in the 110's to120's with a systolic pressure in the 80's. She was able totolerate 6.25 mg of Captopril and thus was discharged on a dose of2.5 mg of the Lisinopril daily.2 ) Pulmonary: The patient's shortness of breath resolved as herfluid status stabilized. At the time of discharge her lungs wereclear to auscultation and her oxygen saturation was in the high90's on room air.3 ) Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis resolved with lipase at thetime of discharge of 302. Amylase was normal. She had no furtherabdominal pain. She declined a nasal gastric feeding tube but wasable to advance her diet. Nutrition was consulted and suggestednutrition supplements which the patient was reluctant to take.4 ) Infectious Diseases: The patient was not on any antibiotics atthe time of discharge and remained afebrile.5 ) Physical Condition: The patient was able to walk and toleratelight exercise. She had been orthostatic , dropping her bloodpressure to the 60's on standing up but was without symptoms. Herorthostasis improved with decreasing the amount of diuresis. Shewas scheduled to have Physical Therapy at home after discharge fromthe hospital.6 ) Mental Status: The patient's base lines at the beginning ofher admission was lethargic and confused.

Thepatient had done well at rehab with significant improvement inhis pulmonary status to the point that he was off the ventilatorusing a nasal cannula for supplementary oxygen only. He also hadsignificant improvement in his functional status with ability tostand and ambulate for short distances as well as improvement inhis mental status back to baseline. However , over the severaldays prior to this admission his respiratory status had beendeteriorating with an increasing respiratory rate , increased workof breathing , and falling oxygen saturations. For the last twonights prior to admission , the patient had to be bagged overnightand was not able to maintain saturations above the high 80s. Hehad been afebrile with no change in cough or secretions. Hedenied any abdominal pain , vomiting , or diarrhea. He was startedon empiric levofloxacin on the day prior to admission as well assome increased diuresis with an increase in his standing Lasixdose to 40 mg IV q. 8h. According to the patient's wife , thisdid improve his respiratory status somewhat; however , he wasstill unable to remain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patientalso received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocritof 25 the day prior to admission. The morning of admission toRonon Health it was felt that the patient'srespiratory distress and poor oxygenation were such that heneeded to return to ventilator assistance. The patient was thentransferred to the Prinin Health EmergencyDepartment where on arrival his vitals were notable for a heartrate of 76 , blood pressure 123/62 , respirations 28 , oxygensaturation of 92% by nasal cannula. He was placed on theventilator at pressure support with 10 of pressure support and 5of peak with an FIO2 of 50%. Arterial blood gas at this time was7.38 , 66 , and 63.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Diabetes mellitus ( hemoglobin A1c of approximately 10 ).2. Morbid obesity , likely obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.3. Status post tracheostomy and PEG placement after PMH MICUstay for hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure , 8/1/06 to3/10/06 .4.

He is a former longshoreman. He isself-educated and an avid reader. His wife is a neonatalintensive care unit attending physician at Gno Jones Medical Center .The patient quit use of tobacco in 1995 and does not drinkalcohol. He denies use of any illicit drugs.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:On arrival to WBKH MICU , was notable for temperature of 97.3 ,heart rate 68 and normal sinus rhythm , blood pressure 140/56 ,respiratory rate in the 30s , oxygen saturation 92% on pressuresupport 10 and 5 with an FiO2 of 50%. The patient was an obesealert man in no acute distress. Physical exam notable for coarsebreath sounds anteriorly and diminished breath sounds atbilateral bases , distant heart sounds. Right lower extremity hasa BKA. Left lower extremity with 2+ edema with some chroniccolor change suggestive of venous insufficiency. Distal pulsenot palpable.Chest x-ray revealed tracheostomy tube in position , a rightpleural effusion , somewhat difficult to evaluate lung bases.Echocardiogram 8/1/06 revealed normal size and function of theleft ventricle , normal right ventricle , and a trivial pericardialeffusion.LABORATORY DATA:At the time of admission , were notable for a creatinine of 1.3improved from 1.5 at the time of discharge on 3/10/06 .Urinalysis revealed 50-100 red blood cells but 0-2 white bloodcells. White blood count was 9.1 with 75 polyps , 14 lymphs , and8 monos. Hematocrit was 30.7 , which is at baseline.EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 77 , normal axis , normalintervals and less than 1-mm of ST depression in leads 2 , 3 , V4through V6.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM AND PROBLEM:1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure , likely multifactorial fromobesity-hypoventilation syndrome , sleep apnea , question COPD.Recurrent decompensation was thought to be precipitated by volumeoverload and subsequent pleural effusion. The patient improveddramatically with aggressive diuresis and he was able tosuccessfully transition back to use of trache collar during theday , however , it seems that he does better with ventilatorysupport overnight and current permanent plan of care is totransition patient to home ventilator support such that he willsupplemental oxygen either by nasal cannula or trache collarduring the day and be able to use the ventilator at night. Thepatient was also continued on inhaled steroids and nebulizers.2. Positive blood culture , 1/4 bottles from blood cultures drawnon 7/26/06 were positive for Gram-positive cocci and clusters;however , he was afebrile and with no clinical evidence ofinfection , so this was thought likely to be contaminant and notreatment was given.3. Fluid overload. As noted , the patient responded very well todiuresis. He was transitioned to a new stable dose of p.o. Lasixnamely 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. This will need to be adjusted asneeded.4. Hypertension. The patient was continued on his home regimenof labetalol and amlodipine on which he did well.5. Diabetes. The patient was continued on home regimen ofLantus , however , this was titrated up somewhat due to someelevated sugars the last few days of his admission. He is sentout on Lantus 60 mg subcutaneously at bedtime as well as aregular insulin sliding scale.6. Nutrition. The patient should follow a cardiac , diabeticsalt restricted and fluid restricted p.o. diet. He does have aPEG tube for supplemental feeding should he be unable to takep.o. but at the time of discharge he is doing well with amechanical soft diet with the above restrictions.7. The patient is therapeutically anticoagulated on Coumadin.Indication is history of DVT. He will be continued on a dose of3 mg at bedtime. Coumadin should be drawn every two daysinitially until it is clear that this is the correct stable dosefor him. It may need to be titrated up or down.CODE STATUS:The patient is full code.MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , labetalol 200mg p.o. t.i.d. , amlodipine 10 mg p.o. daily , simvastatin 80 mgp.o. at bedtime , Coumadin 3 mg p.o. at bedtime , Lantus 60 mgsubcutaneously at bedtime , regular insulin sliding scale ,Pulmicort 0.25 mg nebulizers q. 12h. , albuterol 2.5 mg nebulizedq. 4h. , Combivent MDI two puffs inhaled q. 4h. , Ocean spray twosprays q.i.d. to nostrils , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , senna oneteaspoon p.o. at bedtime , bisacodyl 10 mg per rectum daily , K-Dur20 mEq p.o. daily , magnesium oxide 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nystatinsuspension 5 ml swish and spit q.i.d. , Haldol 5 mg p.o. atbedtime p.r.n. and Haldol 1 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n.The patient is discharged in stable condition to Gene Worthalbmonte Hospital And Rehabilitation Center on 6/3/06 .eScription document: 3-1901231 EMSSten TelDictated By: KEISER , JARVISAttending: PASQUIN , GRANTDictation ID 6600693D: 6/3/06T: 6/3/06

The patient was treated with a percutaneouscholecystostomy tube as bridging therapy; however , the patient'scholecystostomy tube was subsequently accidentally pulled out inthe weeks preceding her current admission. In the interim , thepatient denied any associated nausea , vomiting , fever , ordiarrhea. She was subsequently scheduled for an exploratorylaparotomy with an open cholecystectomy , which took place on6/25/2005 . In order to fully address concerns related to herhistory of polychondritis , the patient was scheduled for apreoperative admission and pulmonary evaluation and wassubsequently admitted to the General Surgery Service on thedirection of Dr. Arron Mcdunn on 5/13 .PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Relapsing polychondritis with associated interstitial lungdisease , tracheal , ear cartilage and nose involvement , managedwith dapsone , adalimumab , and steroids at home; morbid obesity;COPD/OSA on CPAP at home; osteoporosis; bilateral avascularnecrosis of the hip; depression.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:Notable for prior sinus surgery , bilateral carpal tunnel surgery.HOME MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Included levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. daily , Flagyl 500 mg p.o.daily , prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. , trazodone , Effexor ,Neurontin , quinine , Seroquel , Flexeril , OxyContin , DuoNeb ,Advair , Caltrate plus vitamin D , Colace , esomeprazole.ALLERGIES:No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY:The patient has no notable alcohol , tobacco or IV drug usehistory.

UA was noted to be clear without evidence of urinarytract infection.EKG was notable for normal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minutewithout evidence of acute ischemia. Preoperative plain film ofthe chest demonstrated unremarkable sinus and no acutecardiopulmonary process seen.HOSPITAL COURSE:The patient was admitted to the General Surgery Service on thedirection of Dr. Morgan Taverner on 1/1/2005 . As mentionedpreviously , her admission was scheduled several days prior to aplanned surgery in order to permit adequate evaluation by thePulmonary , Thoracic Surgery and Rheumatology Services in order toclear for her planned surgical intervention given her history ofpolychondritis. Following extensive review by the above-namedservices , the patient was cleared for operative intervention andsubsequently underwent an open cholecystectomy on 6/25/2005 .For detailed description of the patient's operative procedure ,please see the relevant operative report.The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequentlytransferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for furtherevaluation and management postoperatively. Given concerns abouther airway and for continuous monitoring given concerns about herbody habitus. While in the Intensive Care Unit , the patientcould rest well clinically without acute events. She remainedstable from a cardiovascular standpoint and her pulmonary statuswas noted to be stable through the duration of her initialadmission to the Intensive Care Unit. Following closedobservation in the ICU , the patient was subsequently cleared fortransfer to the regular patient floor on postoperative day numberone , 4/1/2005 . While on the regular floor , the patientinitially progressed well clinically. She was successfullyweaned from IV analgesia and was transitioned to oral painmedications without complications. She initially remained stablefrom a cardiovascular perspective and was noted to demonstrate astable wound exam with declining liver function studies throughpostoperative day #2 , 2005.At this point , once the patient was deemed stable for dischargeto home , she demonstrated an acute episode of increased work ofbreathing and shortness of breath with an abrupt increase in heroxygen requirements. Despite aggressive attempts to improveoxygenation through noninvasive means , the patient proved tounable to achieve oxygenation status with these measures and wastransferred emergently to the Intensive Care Unit for intubation.Of note , arterial blood gas drawn in the context of this episodedemonstrated a widened A-a gradient concerning for a possiblecoronary embolus. Given the patient's habitus and her weight ,however , she was deemed inappropriate for a PE protocol scanningand was treated presumptively for pulmonary embolus. Theremainder of the patient's admission was spent in the IntensiveCare Unit and was punctuated by respiratory failure , suspectedpulmonary embolus requiring ongoing heparin therapy , developmentof intraabdominal bile leak requiring repeat exploratorylaparotomy and drainage procedure.The subjects of the patient's admission will be further describedby system as follows:1. Neurological: For the duration of her extended stay in theIntensive Care Unit , the patient remained adequately sedated withIV agents including fentanyl and Versed. Of note , the patientwas noted to demonstrate massive requirements of sedatinganalgesic agents in order to provide adequate comfort. Despitethis , however , she was successfully weaned to a regimen ofintermittent opioid dosing via her G-tube , which she was noted totolerate without complication. With gradual withdrawal of hersedating agents , the patient was noted to be appropriate andresponsive and demonstrated no evidence of neurologicalcompromise. Of note , the patient at no demonstrated any evidenceof acute neurological events or cerebrovascular accidentsnecessitating further evaluation from a neurological perspective.At the time of this dictation , the patient is noted to be alert ,oriented and comfortable on an analgesia regimen consisting ofstable fentanyl infusion and p.r.n. oxycodone. She was noted tomove all extremities to command , noted to be appropriate toquestioning , demonstrates no evidence of neurological compromiseon gross exam.2. Cardiovascular: The patient's Intensive Care Unit stay waspunctuated by progressive septic physiology requiring ongoingpressor support for a period of several weeks in order tomaintain adequate profusion pressures. As her intraabdominalprocess progressed , the patient was noted to require increasingsupport with multiple agents including neosynephrine andvasopressin; however , following appropriate surgical debridementof her intraabdominal bile collection , she was graduallysuccessfully weaned from pressor agents and at no pointafterwards required further aggressive pressure therapy in orderto maintain adequate pressures. She at no point demonstrated anyevidence of acute myocardial ischemia despite multiple rule outprotocols in the setting of hypertensive episodes. Serialbedside echocardiograms demonstrated no evidence of acutemyocardial dysfunction or diminution of ejection fraction and shesubsequently was noted to stabilize from cardiovascularperspective. Of note , over the course of her admission , thepatient was noted to demonstrate periodic episodes of idiopathicbradycardia unrelated to oxygenation status; however , she at nopoint required external pacing or atropine therapy in order totreat such episodes and was noted on all occasions asspontaneously resolved her bradycardic episodes. At the time ofthis dictation , the patient is noted to be stable with regularrate and rhythm and no evidence of acute myocardial dysfunction.She is free of pressor support and continues on a standingregimen of Lopressor 25 mg per J-tube q.6h. without complication.Followup EKG demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia andshe has been free of episodes of bradycardia for at least thepast 10 days.3. Pulmonary: As described above , the inciting events for thepatient's return to the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day#2 was noted to be acute respiratory distress secondary topresumed pulmonary embolus. Unfortunately , the patient's bodyhabitus precluded her from a definitive pulmonary embolusprotocol CT scan and she was therefore started empirically on IVheparin therapy in order to provide adequate anticoagulation.Her weight incidentally also precluded her from additionalstudies to evaluate for evidence of pulmonary embolus including aVQ scan , thus her PE treatment regimen was based on empiricevidence only. Following institution of heparin therapy , thepatient's oxygenation status was noted to gradually improve ,although her pulmonary status was noted to decline withsubsequent increase in fluid requirements given her septicphysiology. Serial day x-rays performed in Intensive Care Unitdemonstrated evidence of fluid overload through the course of herstay , which also likely compromised her oxygen status initially.Given her ongoing requirement for pressor therapy while followingthe development of her intraabdominal pathology , the patient wasrecommended for a tracheostomy procedure given the expectation ofprolonged mechanical ventilation requirements. She thereforeunderwent PEG placement on 3/11/2005 following an extensivediscussion with the patient's family regarding her likelyprognosis. For a detailed discussion of this procedure in thecontext of a concomitant repeat exploratory laparotomy andJ-tube/G-tube insertion , please see relevant operative report.Following placement of this tracheostomy , the patient progressedwell clinically from respiratory perspective. Following drainageof her intraabdominal bile leak , the patient's septic physiologywas noted to gradually resolve and she was successfully weanedfrom pressor therapy. With cessation of her pressors , adequatediuresis was rendered possible and the patient was effectivelyfluid oscillated for the duration of her Intensive Care Unitstay.With the fluid oscillating , the patient's respiratory statuscontinued to improve as such her serial chest x-ray demonstratedgradually resolving over load. With diuresis , the patient wassubsequently gradually weaned from pressor support to successfultrach collar trials , which she accomplished without complication.As the time of this dictation , the patient is noted to betolerating to the extended trach collar trials during the daywith planned ventilatory arrest at night. Her respiratory examdemonstrated lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally withmild bibasilar crackles and no additional evidence of acuterespiratory failure. Her trach site is clean , dry , and intactwith no evidence of cuff leak. The patient is successfullytolerating trials of a Passe Muir valve , which has provided herwith ability to vocalize while on her trach collar trials. Apotential plan for trach tube downsizing has been deferred forthe movement given concerns about the risk of returning thepatient to the operating room for this procedure. Given the lackof acute indication for such a procedure , it has been deemed bestto defer such an intervention until such surgery deemedabsolutely necessary.4. GI: Shortly , following the patient's readmission to theIntensive Care Unit , she was noted to demonstrate graduallyincreasing liver function studies suggestive for potential repeatbiliary obstruction. The GI Service was , therefore , enlisted tocome and tell me potential appropriateness of an ERCP. Followingextensive discussions with the Gastroenterology Service , thepatient was subsequently recommended for an ERCP to be performedin the operating room , which subsequently took place on3/11/2005 . This selection of the operating room as the site forintervention was informed on the basis of her inability to beeffectively scoped in the Radiology suite given her body habitus.In the operating room , the patient underwent successfulplacement of a biliary stent with liberation of a mild amount ofbilious fluid from the common bile duct. No sphincterotomy wasperformed at this point. Following placement of the stent andsuccessful prominence of the ERCP , the patient was initiallynoted to improve clinically with a transient diminish in herbiliary studies. However , shortly following , she again notedgradual increase in her biliary studies and gradual worsening inher general clinical exam associated with increasing fevers andseptic physiology. Serial abdominal exams were notable forgradual increasing abdominal distension , necessitating a returnto the operating room on 3/11/2005 for a combined tracheotomy ,exploratory laparotomy , drain placement , G-tube/J-tube placement ,and biliary drainage procedure. For a detailed description ofthe patient's operative procedure , please see a relevantoperative report. Of note , the patient was noted to demonstratea 3-liter bile collection intraoperatively with no evidence ofbowel injury or ischemia upon performing of this procedure.Multiple intraabdominal drains were placed and no evidence ofactive bile leak was noted at the time of this procedure.Postoperatively , the patient progressed well clinically. Herbiliary function studies were noted to gradually normalizefollowing the drainage procedure and her abdominal exam remainedstable for the duration of her posterior course. Followingeffective drainage of this collection , the patient's septicphysiology was noted to gradually correct , allowing effectiveweaning of her pressor support and marked in all organ systemfunctions. She thereafter successfully started no tube feeds fornutritional supplementation , which she tolerated withoutcomplication. At all times , effective GI prophylaxis wasprovided by Pepcid and PPI therapy. At the time of thisdictation , the patient's GI exam remained stable. Her abdomenwas soft , nondistended and nontender with evidence of morbidobesity per her baseline exam. Her surgical incisions were notedto be clean , dry and intact with staples in place. Of note , hermidline incision was left partially opened in order to promoteadequate wean drainage postoperatively and to permit healing bysecondary intervention; this incision has continued to remainstable with no evidence of active infection postoperatively. Herdrain output has gradually diminished over her postoperativecourse , permitting removal of one of her JP drains. Her G-tubeand J-tube sites remained clean , dry and intact with her tubesremaining in place and functional. The patient is currentlyrunning tube feeds at goal via her J-tube without complication.Her G-tube continuous to vent appropriately without incident.5. GU: Following transfer , the patient to the Intensive CareUnit her urinary output continued to be monitored on a continuousbasis in order to reassess her hydration status. Through thecourse of her time of septic physiology , the patient demonstratedvariable urine output correlated approximately with her bloodpressures. With resolution of her septic physiology , however ,the patient was noted to be exuberantly responsive to efforts atdiuresis and was quickly noted to be independently productive oflarge amounts of urine without diuretic therapy. Shesuccessfully oscillated her fluids through the duration of heradmission , at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renalfailure or electrolyte abnormalities. She at no pointdemonstrated any evidence of a hemodialysis requirement duringthe course of her admission. At the time of this dictation , thepatient remained independently productive of adequate amounts ofurine in order of 700 cc per hour via her Foley catheter. Herelectrolytes remained stable and BUN and creatinine demonstrateno evidence of acute renal failure.6. Heme: As stated previously , the presumed etiology of thepatient's return to the Intensive Care Unit was thought to be anacute , hemodynamically stable pulmonary embolism. The patientwas immediately started on heparin therapy , which continued forthe duration of her ICU stay until the point of transition toCoumadin therapy. Of note , the patient required large doses ofheparin in order to provide a therapeutic PTT with hourlyinfusion rate in order of 2000-2500 units of heparin per hour.Following prolonged heparin invasion and gradual stabilization ofher clinical status , the patient was gradually transitioned toCoumadin therapy via her J-tube without complication. At thetime of this dictation , the patient remained borderlinetherapeutic on Coumadin with an INR of 1.7 on a daily dose ofCoumadin 5 mg per day. She at no point has demonstrated anyevidence of postoperative hemorrhage or bleeding instability; herplatelet count has likewise remained stable for the duration ofher stay. Although , the potential for placement of an IVC filterwas discussed on several occasions during the duration of hercurrent admission , the patient's body habitus precludes her fromeffective radiological placement of such a filter and suchintervention is therefore been deferred at least for the timebeing.7. ID: Following transfer of the patient to the Intensive CareUnit , she was noted to demonstrate gradually worsening septicphysiology associated with spiking fevers for much of her initialIntensive Care Unit stay. Serial cultures of blood , sputum ,urine and biliary drainage were notable for evidence of nearpan-resistant pseudomonas in her biliary drainage site. AnInfectious Disease consultation was therefore obtained. Thepatient was recommended for broad-spectrum antibiotic therapyconsisting of linezolid , ceftazidime , Flagyl and colistin. Withgradual worsening of her clinical condition , the patient wassubsequently started on a course of Xigris for a 96-hour periodper Xigris protocol. While on Xigris , the patient did notdemonstrate any appreciable improvement in her septic status andshe was therefore recommended for operative intervention on3/11/2005 as described above. Following drainage of herabdominal bile collection , the patient was noted to gradualimprove clinically with slow resolution of her septic state.Followup cultures continued to demonstrate evidence of biliarypseudomonas colonization necessitating ongoing colistin therapy.With further speciation of her cultures , the patient wassubsequently weaned from all antibiotics except for colistin andunderwent placement of a PICC line for planned prolonged colistintherapy. With stabilization of her clinical status , the patientwas subsequently restarted on her home dapsone regimen in orderto promote PCP prophylaxis given her home immunosuppressive andsteroid regimen. At the time of this discharge , the patientremains afebrile with stable white blood cell count and noadditional culture information suggested for ongoing infection.She has a stable and appropriately positioned upper extremityPICC line , which is functional and continues to permit adequatedosage of her standing colistin antibiotic regimen. As of thisdictation , the patient is planned for ongoing colistin therapyfor several weeks pending modification by the Infectious DiseaseService.8. Endocrine: In the context of her ICU readmission , thepatient was noted to demonstrate widely fluctuant blood sugarsrequiring continues therapy with a Portland protocol insulinschedule. Following successful resolution of her septicphysiology , however , the patient was successfully weaned frominsulin therapy without complication and was noted to demonstratestable blood sugars for the duration of her stay. Given her homesteroid requirement for her chronic polychondritis , the patientwas placed on a steroid taper for the duration of her IntensiveCare Unit stay , which she continues at the time of thisdictation. At no point did she demonstrate any evidence of acuteadrenal insufficiency or thyroid dysfunction in the course of heradmission.At the time of his dictation , the patient remains underevaluation for planned transfer to a vented rehabilitationfacility. The remainder of the patient's hospital course and herdischarge medication regimen will be dictated at the time of hertransfer by an appropriate member of the Intensive Care Unitteam.eScription document: 4-9850357 EMSDictated By: JOCHEMS , SOLOMONAttending: DYE , LUTHERDictation ID 4002998D: 3/5/05T: 3/5/05

So , he self discontinued hismethadone for two days. He also had increased cough and tansputum. Of note , he just completed 14-day course of vancomycin ,cefpodoxime and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia. He also has aG-tube for failed Speech and Swallow test previously. In theemergency room , he received vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl.He had no other complaints on review of system.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post threestents in January of 2005 for an NSTEMI , right hip placement. Hehad a recent aspiration pneumonia , discharged from the Healtten Hospital on4/30/05 . He has type 2 diabetes , left carotid endarterectomy ,hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , congestive heart failure withmost recent ejection fraction of 20% and squamous cell carcinomaoriginally treated in 1989 in the head and neck and relapsed in2005. He is status post carbotaxol and radiation therapy.ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS: Include ECASA 325 daily , Plavix 75 daily , metformin850 twice a day , Zocor 40 mg once a day , paroxetine 2.5 mg once aday , atenolol 25 mg once a day , methadone 5 mg twice a day ,Zofran p.r.n. , Lasix 20 once a day , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. once aday , pyridoxine 5 mg once a day.FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY: His father died of an MI. He livesin Nah Tonco Ette He smokes half a pack per day for unknownnumber of years.PHYSICAL EXAM: He was afebrile. His heart rate was 62 , bloodpressure 110/60 , breathing at 20 breaths per minute with an O2saturation of 97%. He appeared tired with dry mucous membranes.He had diffuse rhonchi on his chest exam. He had a 2/6 systolicmurmur heard best at the apex with a regular rate and rhythm.His abdomen was soft and nontender with his G-tube site clean.His extremities were warm. He was alert and oriented x3 oninitial exam but this waxed and waned during his inpatient stay.PERTINENT LABS: Include glucose originally of 429 brought downwith insulin to 85 , cardiac enzymes which were negative , a whitecount of 17.3 and hematocrit of 31.2 , but his baseline is in the30s. Chest x-ray on admission showed a right lower lobeill-defined opacity concerned for atelectasis versus pneumonia.A head CT showed no acute intracranial abnormality. EKG showednormal sinus rhythm with a borderline QT interval of 490 , leftventricular hypertrophy and deep T-wave inversions in the lateralleads but the same as previous EKGs.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 70-year-old man with multiple medicalproblems including CAD , CHF and cancer with head and neckpresenting with change in mental status possibly due to hismethadone dosage versus infectious etiology namely pneumonia.Hyperglycemia at admission may have been contributory.Pulmonary: Blood cultures were negative for growth. He wasinitially placed on cefotaxime and Flagyl and was changed to p.o.meds , per G-tube meds Flagyl and cefpodoxime. He was continuedon his albuterol nebulizer , Atrovent and a repeat chest x-rayafter intravenous fluids revealed slight improvement. He , fromthe respiratory standpoint , gradually improved with markedincrease in activity and alertness by the day of discharge.Neuro and Psych: His change in mental status was thought to bedue in large part to his methadone changes in dose. He was takenoff the methadone and was eventually placed on Zyprexa 2.5 mg atnight and 2.5 mg at noon. He did wax and wane in terms of hisorientation sometimes thinking he was not at the hospital but healways had the correct date , correct season and knew generallywhat the current events at that time.Cardiovascularly , he was diuresed gently but otherwise has nochange in status.Palliative care: Palliative Care made numerous recommendationsthat we followed , one was to treat with Zyprexa 2.5 mg at nightand at noon to stabilize his mental status fluctuations. Thiscame with uncertain effect as at discharge but overall hisfunctionality had improved and the amount of time he was awareand communicative was overall lengthened. We also started him onfluconazole IV and changed per G-tube upon discharge fortreatment of oral thrush.Endocrine: He was placed on Regular Insulin sliding scale whileon his tube feeds. We also added insulin NPH standing order for8 units at morning.Code status: The possibility of DNR/DNI was discussed at lengthwith the patient and with his family and they repeatedly andultimately decided to have Mr. Lieber be DNR/DNI at this point.They understand the ramifications of this and are comfortablewith this decision.DISPOSITION: Mr. Mcgown is being discharged to rehab at Emplupe Hospital and he will follow up with Dr. Taglialatela , his oncologist.FOLLOWING PHYSICIAN: Fletcher Valladares , MDeScription document: 9-5877284 CSCC: Er-west Vewina Medical CenterCC: Darrick Stodghill M.D.Medical Oncology , Tonbrooks Rence HospitalA HamDictated By: MUSKETT , DARRELAttending: REDING , TOM ABDULDictation ID 3492344D: 5/7/05T: 5/7/05

For herrheumatoid and gouty arthritis , she had been long treated withmethotrexate and allopurinol. In 5/3 , due to worsening renalinsufficiency , her methotrexate was discontinued. Followingthis , she was seen by her rheumatologist with complaints ofworsening joint pains and body aches , for which she was startedon Plaquenil on 7/25/07 . On 10/3/07 , she presented to theRy And Hospital Emergency Department complaining oftotal body pain. In particular , she said that her left groin wasvery painful , although when asked , she said that every joint andmuscle group was causing discomfort. She denied fevers , chills ,loose stools , urinary symptoms , nausea , vomiting or otherconstitutional symptoms aside from a headache on the day ofadmission. Her pain especially in her hip was so severe at thetime of admission that she felt that she was not able to walk.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.

Her father passed away at the ageof 66 from an aneurysm.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Her temperature was 97.7 ,pulse of 93 , respirations 16 , blood pressure 151/69 , satting 99%on room air. In general , she was awake , alert , oriented ,conversant , but in pain. HEENT: Extraocular muscles wereintact , mucous membranes are moist , neck was supple , JVP was notnoticeably elevated. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm.Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft ,diffusely tender especially in the left and right lowerquadrants , with a question of rebound in these distributions aswell. Extremities: Warm and well perfused , nocyanosis/clubbing/edema. Extremities: Exquisite tenderness topalpation over the left hip ( due to severe pain , the patientcould not be positioned in lateral decubitus position toaccurately assess for bursal pain ) , positive left hip pain oninternal and external rotation of the hip , and positive leftelbow pain , along with pain in multiple other areas , withoutobvious erythema , effusion , warmth or trauma.LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION: Her sodium was 130 , potassiumof 4.1 , chloride of 99 , bicarb of 22 , BUN of 78 , creatinine of2.3 ( baseline creatinine 1.9-2.5 ) , glucose of 227. Her whitecount was 11.8 , hematocrit of 26.9 ( baseline hematocrit of29-30 ) , platelets of 378 , 000. Her ALT was 12 , AST was 12 ,alkaline phosphatase of 98 , total bilirubin 0.2 , albumin was 3.1and globulin was 4.2. Her ESR was 103 , CRP was 151.OTHER PERTINENT LABS DURING THE COURSE OF HER HOSPITALIZATION:Her initial urine sodium was 34 , urine creatinine 58.2 , urine BUN555; urine eosinophils negative; urinalysis showed 2+ protein , 23white cells , 1 red blood cell , 1+ bacteria and 2+ squamous cells.On 10/3/07 , urine cultures and blood cultures negative;8/28/07 urine culture positive for MRSA , sensitive to Bactrim.On 3/8/07 , left hip washing and aspiration Gram-stain negativeand culture negative. On 7/25/07 , C. difficile negative.HER RELEVANT STUDIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: On 10/3/07 , pelvic and hipx-rays demonstrated right hip rheumatoid arthritis , narrowing ofthe right SI joint; no acute abnormality or effusion in the lefthip. On 10/3/07 , lower extremity noninvasive studies negative.On 10/3/07 , KUB showing gastric antral gas. On 10/3/07abdominal CAT scan notable for bilateral peri renal straining( old ) , mesenteric stranding ( old ) , left phlebolith. On 3/8/07echocardiogram , EF of 60% , concentric left ventricularhypertrophy , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspidregurgitation , pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 38 plusright atrial pressure , trace effusion.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 65-year-old female with a history ofrheumatoid and gouty arthritis , diabetes , sickle cell trait andchronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ) , admitted fordiffuse body aches and pains , most likely attributable to arheumatoid arthritis flare.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Body aches and joint pains: The differential diagnosis forthe patient's body aches and joint pains initially included arheumatoid arthritis flare , septic joint , crystal joint disease ,intra-abdominal process or Plaquenil reaction. Her abdominal CATscan showed stable peri-renal standing and mesenteric stranding.Her creatinine kinase was normal. Her urine culture from thesecond day of hospitalization was notable for MRSA. A left hipaspiration was attempted by Interventional Radiology; no fluidwas obtainable , so a washing followed by drainage was performed ,which had a negative Gram-stain and negative cultures.Similarly , blood cultures were negative , and an echocardiogramrevealed no evidence of endocarditis as an explanation for herMRSA urinary tract infection. By process of elimination ,therefore , the etiology of her body aches and joint pains wastherefore thought to be rheumatoid arthritis flare , although ofnote , her ESR and CRP were a bit higher than would be expectedfor a rheumatoid arthritis flare. She was seen by theRheumatology Consult Service , who stated that the Plaquenil wouldtake a few weeks to exert its effect. As a result , she wasstarted on prednisone and uptitrated per symptoms. In addition ,she was started on leflunomide. Initially , there were plans tostart Enbrel , and a PPD placed was negative; however , due to herconcomitant MRSA urinary tract infection , such plans have beendeferred to the outpatient setting.2. MRSA urinary tract infection: As discussed above , her urineculture day after admission was notable for MRSA , sensitive toBactrim. Due to hip pain and one mild fever to the range of100.6-100.9 with persistent leukocytosis in the range of 11 to15 , Interventional Radiology did a hip wash and aspirate that wasnegative , as well as a transthoracic echo that was negative forevidence of endocarditis. Surveillance blood cultures similarlywere negative. She was started on vancomycin , with plans tochange to Bactrim upon discharge.3. Pain control: The patient was on standing and p.r.n.Dilaudid , along with OxyContin t.i.d. , the latter of which sherefused due to nausea. She was , therefore , started on a fentanylpatch with standing and p.r.n. Dilaudid. She did well on thisstanding and p.r.n. Dilaudid. As of discharge , she has done wellon this regimen.4. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive with systolicblood pressures in the range of 170s at multiple times during herhospitalization. This is partly from pain , and partly from poorcontrol of her central hypertension. She was maintained onToprol , Imdur , hydralazine and amlodipine , which were titratedfor a maximum effect. Because of refractory hypertension , werecommend that she undergo renal artery imaging as an outpatient.5. Diabetes: The patient was started on NPH , short-actingprandial insulin and a sliding scale , all of which were uptitrated while she was inhouse.6. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient had acuteon chronic renal insufficiency ( creatinine on admission 2.3 ,baseline of 1.9 ). This was thought to be predominantly prerenal.Through her hospitalization , her creatinine gradually decreasedto her baseline of 1.9.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: A separate dictation for medicationlist will be supplied when the patient is ready for discharge.eScription document: 6-0706017 CSSten TelDictated By: CANOY , IRVINGAttending: BOZZO , CLEVELANDDictation ID 9360983D: 7/28/07T: 7/28/07

Unstable angina.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Brincefield is a 59 year old gentlemanwith a history of coronary arterydisease , status post PTCA in 1990 who present with recurrentuncontrolled chest pain. He had a positive exercise tolerance testin October of 1990 which led to a catheterization which showed 100% proximal right coronary artery and 60 % OMB-2. He had successfulPTCA of his right coronary artery. His chest pain recurred inFebruary of 1990 and he had another positive stress test ,catheterization showed restenosis at the PTCA site and a secondPTCA was performed successfully. He has done well with negativestress test , most recently in 6/7 .Over the last several weeks to months , he has noted increasingchest pain with less and less exertion and now presents with on andoff chest pain over the last 18 hours prior to admission. He wastreated in the Canter Memorial Hospital emergency room with betablockers and IV TNG which was limited by low blood pressure andbradycardia. Because of ongoing chest pain with EKG changes , thepatient was taken directly to the cath lab and found to have a 70 %left main , 80 % proximal LAD , 60 % OMB 2 , and minor irregularitiesat the right coronary artery PTCA site.Because of his continuing chest pain in the cath lab , anintra-aortic balloon pump was placed and the patient wastransferred to the CCU. His past medical history is significantfor coronary artery disease , hypertension , depression. He has nopast surgical history.MEDICATIONS: His medications on admission include Diltiazem ,Naprosyn , aspirin , Prozac.ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a white gentleman in moderatedistress. His heart rate is 54 , bloodpressure of 100/60 , jugular venous distention to 8 cm. with nocarotid bruits. Chest is clear to auscultation. The heart rate isregular with a regular rhythm and no murmur. The abdomen isbenign. Neurologically , is grossly intact. His EKG on admissionshows sinus bradycardia with lateral ST and T wave abnormalities.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital andunderwent emergent catheterization as aboverequiring an intra-aortic balloon pump and was then taken forurgent surgery. On 7/28/95 , he was taken to the operating roomwhere he underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 utilizingthe left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descendingcoronary artery , and saphenous vein grafts to the obtuse marginal ,ramus , under general endotracheal anesthesia and cardiopulmonarybypass. This was performed by Dr. Gondek and there were nocomplications and the patient tolerated the procedure well. He wastaken to the post surgical intensive care unit in stable condition.He remained hemodynamically stable over the first postoperativenight and was extubated without any problem. His intra-aorticballoon pump was weaned down as tolerated and removed at the bedside. He was started on Lopressor and aspirin and continued onAncef perioperatively. He was given Lasix for diuresis andresponded well. He progressed well and had his chest tubes removedand was ambulating and tolerating a regular diet well. Bypostoperative day five , a moderate amount of tan drainage wasnoticed at the lower portion of his sternal wound. The sternum wasonly slightly unstable and the wires all appeared intact on chestx-ray. He was started no Vancomycin. By postoperative day seven ,he continued to be afebrile and hemodynamically stable , saturatingat 95 % on room air. His sternal wound remained clean and he wasdischarged home to be followed up by VNA with dressing changes andmonitored closely.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Include enteric coated aspirin once aday , Prozac twice a day , Lopressor 25 mg.bid , Tylox one to two capsules q three to four hours prn pain ,Cipro 500 mg. bid for five days.He will follow up with Dr. Lemieux and with his local physician.Dictated By: ELLIS S.

He was noted intriage to have a blood pressure of 210/130 and was triaged tourgent. The patient has had a long-standing history ofhypertension and he stopped his medications actually about twomonths ago when he ran out of prescriptions. Following this thepatient began to note some difficulty with dyspnea on exertion andhas also noted some altered sensations in his chest during the weekprior to admission , which lasted approximately one to two secondsand occurred primarily at rest. These occurred across his chestbut did not radiate. The patient stated his shortness of breathhas become progressively worse. He has had no orthopnea.Basically , over the past three weeks the patient has noted ( 1 ) hisirregular heart beat , as if he is missing beats , although he doesnot note any tachycardia , ( 2 ) dyspnea on exertion , includingorthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and ( 3 ) intermittentsubsternal chest pain which occurs only at rest and not withexertion. He described this as an ache and stated it did notradiate. The episodes lasted , at the most , four to five minutes ,and resolved on their own without any other symptoms. He deniesany syncope or presyncope. Four years ago , as mentioned , heslipped at work , bending his right leg , and has subsequently hadincreased swelling of his right knee , foot and calf , also with somecalf pain. Today was a holiday and he had off from work , so hecame to the Emergency Ward , primarily for evaluation of his kneeand his dyspnea. At that time they found that he was in atrialflutter.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history includeshypertension , LVH , asthma , increasedcholesterol , borderline diabetes mellitus , obesity , gastritis ,allergic rhinitis , depression , osteoarthritis , chronic right kneeeffusion , and impotence , status post penile implant.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: His medications include Procardia XL60 mg q day , Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg qday , Mevacor 40 mg q day , Ventolin and Beconase inhalers , Seldanep.r.n. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg h.s. , and Paxil 20 mg qday. He has not taken these in the past two months.SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and lives with his wife. He is abulldozer operator. He does not smoke , drink oruse any drugs.FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for coronary arterydisease.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His physical examination showed a blackmale in no acute distress. His pressure atthe time of admission examination was 170/100. His heart rate wasin the 50 to 80 range. Respirations were 16. Temperature was98.7. He was satting 98 percent on room air. Heent was benign.Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy. The lungs had somebibasilar crackles and slight wheezes on the left. The heart wasirregularly irregular with an S1 , S2 and S4. There were nomurmurs. The abdomen had normal bowel sounds and was soft , mildlyobese and non-tender. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal washeme negative per Emergency Ward. Extremities showed 1+ rightedema and some trace , left sided , lower extremity edema. Rightknee was very swollen and he had right calf tenderness but no cord.On neurological examination he was alert and oriented times three.Examination was non-focal.LABORATORY DATA: Labs showed a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.4 ,chloride of 102 , bicarbonate of 26 , BUN 14 ,creatinine 1.1 , and blood glucose was 122. Magnesium was 1.6. CKwas 385 and MB was 2.9. White cell count was 7.8 , hematocrit 43.7 ,and platelets were 234 , 000. His PT was 12.7 , PTT 24.4. Chestx-ray showed increased cardiac silhouette , PVR , and there were noinfiltrates. The knee film showed a large effusion , which waspresent in the past , and some osteoarthritis but no sign offracture. The patient had lower extremity non invasives which werenegative and a VQ scan which was read as between low andintermediate probability.ASSESSMENT: This is a 60 year old man with long-standinghypertension , now off medications for two months. Hepresented with new atrial fibrillation , mild congestive heartfailure and intermittent atypical chest pain. Given symptoms werepredated by a leg injury , his lower extremity non invasives werenegative and VQ scan was low to intermediate probability , thepossibility of pulmonary embolism was not further pursued. Likelymechanism is poorly controlled hypertension and conduction systemdisease causing atrial flutter and congestive heart failure. Hislow rate is worrisome for intrinsic conduction disease and it wasconsidered that there was no need for anticoagulation for atrialflutter.HOSPITAL COURSE: As noted , the patient had lower extremity noninvasives and VQ scans which were essentiallynegative and he was not treated for pulmonary embolism , as it wasconsidered to be ruled out. He had an echocardiogram during hisadmission which showed 50 percent ejection fraction with inferiorhypokinesis and left atrial size of 4 cm. The patient remained inatrial flutter during his admission and was coumadinized for theconcern he may be slipping from atrial flutter to atrialfibrillation occasionally. He was also started on Digoxin. Thepatient remained stable and did well. He ruled out for myocardialinfarction. He was then discharged for follow up with Dr.Gulbraa for his general medical concerns and will have anappointment with Dr. Linegar for cardioversion and an exercisetolerance test. The patient's Dig levels and PT will be checked asan outpatient by the VNA services and these will also be called toDr. Beckler . The patient's admission was without complication.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: The patient's discharge medicationsand dosing were Ventolin two puffsq.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , Ecasa 325 mg p.o. q day , Digoxin0.25 mg p.o. q day , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q day , Lisinopril 30 mg p.o.q day , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , naproxen 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.p.r.n. pain , Procardia XL 90 mg p.o. q day , Azmacort six puffsb.i.d. , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Serevent two puffs inhaler b.i.d. ,Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient's condition ondischarge was stable.

Ejection fractionon echocardiogram was 35 percent , severe apical hypokinesis andlateral hypokinesis , inferior diskinesis , trace mitralregurgitation , mild tricuspid regurgitation. Electrocardiogramshowed normal sinus rhythm with anterior infarct. BUN andcreatinine was 1.9 and 1.6.PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient was awake , alert and oriented timesthree. Good oral hygiene. No carotid bruits.HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs or gallops.CHEST: Clear to auscultation to the bases. ABDOMEN: Soft ,nontender and nondistended , normal active bowel sounds.Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was informed consented of all therisks and benefits of the procedure and thepatient was adequate prepared preoperative before the actualsurgery. For more details of the actual surgery please refer toDr. Burress ' operative note on 5/15/99 . Immediately postoperativelythe patient was taken to the cardiac surgery intensive care unitwhere he was admitted without difficulty. The patient woke upappropriately and was extubated. The patient had cardiac index of2.3 , was kept on Neoral and epinephrine for pressor support. Thepatient was advancing his diet as tolerated after extubation andwas making adequate urine output. The patient was tolerating weanfrom epinephrine on postoperative day number one. The patientreceived consultation from the electrophysiology service , as itappeared that the patient had a transient block at the level of theAV-node. The patient continued to be followed in the cardiacsurgery intensive care unit and an echocardiogram was done thatshowed a 30 percent ejection fraction and global hypokinesis. Thepatient had a nonfocal neurological exam. The patient was weaningdown on dopamine and Neoral however still continued to need thisdrip. The patient also had a Lasix drip of 10 per hour. Thepatient was breathing well on the face mask. The patient was keptNPO at this time as he was not able to tolerate p.o. intake withoutnausea. The patient continued to have an elevated creatinine of1.7 , down from 1.9 earlier and a hematocrit of 32.8 with no signsof bleeding. The patient continue to have Ancef for chest tubecoverage.The patient was again seen by the electrophysiology service forpossible change in his rhythm. The rhythm was Wenckebach and thepatient was evaluated for a possible pacemaker. On postoperativeday number three the patient was hemodynamically stable weaning ofof Neoral but still on Dopamine and still requiring a Lasix drip at10 per hour. The patient was still in Wenckebach and the patientcontinued to breathe well however remained at 70%. The patientremained NPO as his respiratory needs took precidence over hiseating and the risk of aspiration was high. The patient continuedto make good urine output however was dependent on the Lasix.Chest tubes were discontinued on this day. The patient wasre-evaluated by the electrophysiology service again. Onpostoperative day number four the patient received a pacemaker andLasix was discontinued on postoperative day number four. Thepacemaker was placed by Dr. Bruess . For more details of thissurgery please refer to his operative note. A Medtronic lead wasplaced.On postoperative day number five the patient continued to doextremely well. The patient was AV-paced on the pacemaker at arate of 80 with a good blood pressure of 155/70. He weaned downoff of all of his drips and pressure support. The patient was ableto come down to four liters and was able to advance on his diet.The patient made good urine output with only p.o. Lasix and theLasix drip was discontinued. The patient was continued on Kefzolfor perioperative AICD placement and transfer to the floor. Onpostoperative day six and seven the patient continued to doextremely well with no change in his management. The patientcontinued on his Lasix , Lopressor and aspirin and Keflex. Anechocardiogram was done that showed an ejection fraction of 30-40percent. There was no change in his management. The patientcontinued to do well advancing in all areas. No instability of hisheart. He advanced to a full house diet making good urine outputwith minimal use of Lasix. The patient was therefore dischargedwithout complications and with placement of the pacemaker on2/8/99 .MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day , Colace 100 mgp.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,NPH Humulin insulin 20 units subcutaneously q a.m. , insulin 10units regular at night , 7 units of regular twice a day , Niferex 150mg p.o. b.i.d. , Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q 4h p.r.n. pain , Zantac150 mg p.o. twice a day , Coumadin to check with the Coumadin clinicfor strict follow up , potassium slow release 10 mEq p.o. q day andZocor 40 mg q night.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient will be discharged to homewith home services to follow up strictlyon his Coumadin dosing.

Coronary artery disease. 2.Hyperlipidemia.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 50 year old gentlemanwith a history of CAD dating back to1991 when the cath showed one vessel disease. He was notangioplastied. The patient had an MI at that time which wasmedically managed. The patient did well until July of 1995 whenthe patient had another anterior MI , massive , treated withthrombolytics. Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed a 99%proximal RCA and serial 70% LAD lesions. The patient also wasnoted to have a severe LV dysfunction with an ejection fraction of28% and his MI was complicated by a complete heart block and a dualchamber pacemaker was placed. At that time the patient wasconsidered to be a surgical candidate secondary to high risk. InAugust of 1995 the patient was admitted for non Q wave MI with apeak CK of 798 , positive MB fraction , and was again treated withthrombolysis with TPA. The patient did well with no anginalsymptoms but has had primarily symptoms of CHF with dyspnea uponexertion , progressive shortness of breath , and limited exercisetolerance since that time. In July of 1996 the patient had anexercise tolerance test with oxygen consumption measured at 11.8ml/kg. The patient exercised for 6 minutes and reached a maximalheart rate of 114 and stopped secondary to dyspnea. Given thepatient's poor functional status he presented for cardiaccatheterization and complete workup for cardiac transplant. Thepatient admits no shortness of breath at rest but with 1-2 flightsof steps. He also becomes short of breath with ten minutes oflight labor. The patient also has daily angina with neck painradiating to his head which is relieved with rest.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. CAD , as above status post MI times threein 1991 and 1995 twice. 2.

Calcium of 9.9 , phosphorus 3.4 , cholesterol 178 ,triglycerides 129. Hematocrit 54 , white count of 5.5 , plateletcount of 188 , 000. PT 1.3 , PTT of 30.5. LFTs: AST 54 , ALT 39.EKG showed a left bundle branch block with Q waves in V1 and V3 ,biatrial enlargement , inverted T waves in II , III , and AVF. Chestx-ray revealed cardiomegaly , DDD pacer wires in position , lungsclear.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted originally for a workupfor cardiac transplant. The patient had acardiac transplant labs drawn , had a PPD placed , which was negativewith positive controls. The patient had a psychiatry consult.Hepatitis serology for hepatitis B and C were negative. Thepatient was kept on heparin at therapeutic levels and was diuresedwith Lasix. His Captopril was also increased. The patient wasalso treated with Isordil. At this point the patient wasreassessed and it was thought that he might be a candidate for arevascularization. With this in mind , the patient was scheduledfor a ETT Thallium which if positive for ischemia he would go for acardiac catheterization. In the meantime the patient was medicallymanaged , diuresed of three to four liters over the several days ofadmission. His Isordil was increased and he was continued on aspirin anddigoxin , on Mevacor. Further transplant labs revealed a TSH of2.8 , T3 of 159 , T4 of 7.8. Urine 24 hour collection total volumewas 4200 cc , creatinine of 29 , urine protein less than assay. Thepatient had his ETT Thallium which showed a question of septalischemia with a fixed apical defect. The patient went 6 minutes ona standard Bruce protocol with a maximum heart rate of 156 , stoppedsecondary to chest pain and 1 mm ST segment depressions. Thepatient went to cardiac catheterization the following day. Thepatient's cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel diseasewith a 100% LAD. His catheterization film was evaluated by cardiacsurgery , Dr. Wolinski who believed that the patient would not benefitfrom a CABG. Given this , the patient received a continuedtransplant workup of a CT of the abdomen , as well as a dentalconsult , with a planned tooth extraction , with appropriatepremedication with amoxicillin , and holding of his heparin. Thepatient tolerated this well. Preliminary report on the CT of theabdomen showed a small single less than 1 cm hepatic lesion. Thepatient was medically stable on discharge.The patient was found to have increasing LFT's upon discharge. Subsequently ,his mevacor was dicontinued and LFT's returned to norma.

Urinalysis was normal.CAROTID IMAGING: The patient had less than 25% stenosis of theright internal and left internal carotid arteries. MR angiogramof the left internal carotid artery showed 60% occlusion and 50%occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiaccatheterization performed on 4/7/06 at Kan Hospital revealed 100% ostial LAD stenosis , 100% proximalcircumflex stenosis , 70% ostial left main stenosis , 75% mid RCAstenosis , 50% proximal RT LV-BR stenosis , and proximal stenosis of theright PDA. CABG grafts from prior bypass surgery were allpatent.Echocardiogram on 6/5/06 showed an ejection fraction of 60% ,aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 38 mmHg and peak gradientof 67 mmHg , calculated valve area was estimated at 0.7 sq cm.There was mild mitral valve insufficiency. An EKG on 5/27/06showed first-degree AV block with a heart rate of 62 and invertedT waves in leads I , aVL and V4 through V6.Chest x-ray on 7/6/06 was consistent with congestive heartfailure and revealed aortic calcifications and left lower lobeatelectasis.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 7/6/06 forcompletion of his preoperative workup. He was brought to theoperating room on 10/22/06 where Dr. Luangrath performed a reoperativesternotomy and a minimally invasive aortic valve replacementusing a 23-mm Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve. Thecardiopulmonary bypass time was 186 minutes and the aorticcross-clamp time was 77 minutes. The patient tolerated theprocedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac SurgeryIntensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. Overthe next few days , the patient was extubated. He had episodes ofuncontrolled hypertension and was placed on a nitroglycerin drip.By postoperative day #4 , the patient had been weaned off hisdrips and his blood pressure was well controlled. He had beenhemodynamically stable and afebrile in the Intensive Care Unit.He was ready for transfer to the regular hospital floor for theremainder of his recovery. At that point , the patient demonstratedpostoperative confusion , particularly at night. Thepatient's neurological exam was otherwise normal. The patientwas started on cardiac medications including captopril , Lopressorand aspirin. He had been extubated without complication and wasoxygenating well with the support of 1 liter of oxygen via nasalcannula. He had no respiratory issues. The patient was seen bythe Speech and Swallow Service for his history of dysphagia andwas cleared for mechanical soft diet with nectar-thick liquidsand crushed pills. The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated.He exhibited adequate urine output with diureticspostoperatively for fluid retention. The patient was followed bythe Diabetes Management Service in the postoperative period forhis history of diabetes. He was initially on an insulin drip andthen weaned to a NovoLog sliding scale with supplemental Lantusinsulin in the evenings. The patient's hematocrit had dropped to22 on postoperative operative day #3 and he was transfused oneunit of packed red blood cells with an appropriate hematocritbumped to 26. On postoperative days #4 through #6 , the patientcontinued his slow steady progress. The neurology team who hadvisited him after surgery after his mental status changesrecommended holding his Sinemet and only to restart if hisParkinson symptoms reoccur. Otherwise , the patientexperienced some hypertension and his blood pressure medicationswere titrated accordingly. The patient remained in a sinusrhythm. By postoperative day #6 , his blood pressure was stable.He was oxygenating well on room air and was ambulatingcomfortably in the halls. He had a sitter accompany him in hisroom for impulsivity , however , this became unnecessary afterpostoperative day #6. A PA and lateral chest x-ray looked clearwith no infiltrates and no pneumothorax. He had returned to hisbaseline mental status and he was deemed ready for discharge tothe rehabilitation facility , which is owned by his daughter.On the day of discharge , the patient's vital signs weretemperature 97.7 degrees , heart rate 65 in sinus rhythm , bloodpressure 104/60 , O2 saturation 97% on room air.

The patient was found to have critical aorticstenosis with a valve area of 0.7 cm2 an EF of 60%. The patientdoes have a history of positive stress test for which a cardiaccatheterization was performed in 6/29 .  At that time , he wasfound to have 40% lesion of the LAD. On admission to theNides Medical Center , on 10/12/05 , cardiac enzymes were drawn and this showeda troponin level of 0.21. EKG showed no acute changes. Thepatient was placed ACS protocol and initially admitted to theCardiology Service. The Cardiac Surgery Service was consultedfor emergent aortic valve repair and potential coronary arterybypass grafting.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Hypertension.2.

Temperature 98.0degrees , heart rate 82 and sinus , blood pressure right arm126/60 , blood pressure left arm 130/68 , and oxygen saturation97%. No carotid bruits , regular rate and rhythm with a loud 4-6systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border , bilateralrales. Soft , nontender , and nondistended abdomen. Extremitieswith 2+ edema bilaterally. Pulses , 2+ femoral bilaterally.Pedal pulses are present by Doppler bilaterally.LABORATORY DATA:Admission labs are significant for BUN of 49 , creatinine of 2.8 ,glucose of 203 , white blood cell count of 9660 , hematocrit of35% , and platelets 269 , 000.IMAGING:1. Cardiac catheterization on 1/11/04 performed at Sonprat Health , 40%proximal LAD lesion , codominant circulation.2. Echocardiogram on 5/13 , aortic stenosis with mean gradient62 mmHg , peak gradient of 82 mmHg , calculated valve area 0.7 cm2 ,mild aortic insufficiency , trivial mitral insufficiency , LVH EFof 50%.3. EKG on 10/21/05 , normal sinus rhythm at 70 with first-degreeAV block , evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.4. Chest x-ray on 10/21/05 , interstitial pulmonary edema.HOSPITAL COURSE:On 10/17/05 , the patient was brought to the operating room forcritical aortic stenosis , acute coronary syndrome and acutepulmonary edema. He underwent an aortic valve replacement with a#21 Carpentier-Edwards magna valve , as well as a coronary arterybypass graft x1 with LIMA to LAD. Bypass time was 120 minutesand crossclamp time 90 minutes. Two atrial wires and oneventricular wire was placed. Please see the operative note forfurther details. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Hewas extubated with without incident on postoperative day #1. Hisneurologic status was in time and he did not suffer any deliriumas witnessed after his initial emergence from anesthesia duringthe renal transplantation. He was noted to have significant oralsecretions , but these were clear and thin. On postoperative day#1 , his femoral arterial line was removed and his renaltransplantation medications restarted. His CK-MB peaked at 46and did trend down thereafter. On postoperative day #2 , he hadbegun to be diuresed in light persistent pulmonary edema and seenby chest x-ray. His chest tubes were removed without incident.On postoperative day #3 , he was hemodynamically stable. His FKlevels were noted to be low , as is historically the case withhim. Renal Transplant Medicine was following and did titratedhis medications as necessary. On postoperative day #4 , his finalleft chest tube was removed. Post-pull chest x-ray showed thelung to be well expanded. He was found to be hyponatremic with asodium of approximately 130. He was begun on fluid restrictionof 1.5 liters for hematocrit of 21. A 1 unit of packed red bloodcells was also given at this time and he was continued ondiuresis. On postoperative day #5 , as his preoperatively weighthad been reached , he was taken off of diuresis.

The patientsaid her symptoms developed about a month ago. She has had stressfor the last few months. Her husband died six months ago frompancreatic cancer. When her palpitations developed she assumedthat they were related to anxiety. She said that she would feel arapid heart rate that would last about thirty minutes at a time andoccurred several times a week. She denied any chest pain orsyncope with these episodes. She presented to cardiology clinic tosee Dr. Hupp where an electrocardiogram was done and she was foundto have a heart rate of 162. Her blood pressure at that time was100/60. She was admitted to the cardiology service for furtherevaluation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease , status postcoronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) in April ,1995. Vessels bypassed were the LIMA/LAD , SVG/PDA. Her CABG waspreceded by her first MI in October 1995 where she was found tohave stenosis in her stenosis in her LAD , RCA. She had PCI to bothvessels in the intervening period. She had unstable angina and wasrecathed which showed restenosis leading up to her CABG. Her lastechocardiogram was in September , 2001 that showed an ejection fraction of20%. 2. Type 2 diabetes which is complicated by peripheralneuropathy. 3. Hypertension. 4. Gout. 5. Anxiety anddepression.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Pravachol 10 mg p.o.q.d.; Elavil 20 mgp.o. once a day; allopurinol 3 x week;Toprol 25 mg once a day; Lasix 40 mg once a day; Accupril 10 mgonce a day; digoxin 0.125 mg once a day; Xanax t.i.d. p.r.n.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's husband died six months ago ofpancreatic cancer. He was a retired Cho S Achepoliceman. She has a long history of heavy smoking but is notcurrently smoking. She denies any alcohol use. She lives alone onthe E Lane , Ma , Arizona 97322 but has a daughter who lives in Cosa Lare StinPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate104 , blood pressure 100/60 , satting 96% onroom air , breathing 18. GENERAL: She is in no acute distress.HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Pupils equally round andreactive to light and accommodation. JVP flat at 45 degrees.CARDIOVASCULAR: She had a laterally displaced PMI , normal S1 ,split S2. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN:Soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES:Lower extremities were warm with 1+ edema bilaterally. NEURO:Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.Electrocardiogram on admission showed normal sinus rhythm with leftatrial enlargement and left bundle branch block. Herelectrocardiogram in clinic showed a wide complex tachycardia and aleft bundle branch block. Her chest x-ray showed no pulmonaryedema or infiltrate.HOSPITAL COURSE: This patient is a 72-year-old woman with asignificant ischemic heart disease who wasadmitted with wide complex tachycardia.1 ) Cardiovascular - Ischemia: The patient's abnormal rhythm waspresumed to be ventricular tachycardia given her history of severeischemic heart disease. Once her tachycardia was stabilized shewas taken to catheterization which showed patent grafts. She didhave a small increase in her troponin but this was thought to berelated to demand. She did not have any complaints of chest painduring the hospitalization. We continued her on her beta blockerand initially held her digoxin while we were controlling herrhythm. She was slightly hypotensive during her episodes oftachycardia so we initially held her Accupril as well , but hermedications were resumed a few days before discharge.Pump: At the time of admission the patient was classified ashaving Class II heart failure although she did admit to not beingvery active and it was felt that if the patient exerted herselfmore she would have more symptoms. On her catheterization herpulmonary capillary wedge pressure was found to be 31 with a normalright atrial pressure. She also had a repeat echocardiogram whichshowed an ejection fraction of 15% with 1+ MR and a thick aorticand mitral valve. She did not exhibit any signs of volume overloadduring her hospitalization and we continued her home dose of Lasix.We also kept her on a two liter fluid restriction but hercreatinine soon began to increase from a baseline level of 1.4 to apeak of 2.1. The patient did admit that she drank a significantlylarger amount of fluid at home and so she was quite hypovolemic incomparison to what she was normally used to. As a result weliberalized her fluid restriction and her creatinine normalized.Rhythm: When the patient arrived her tachycardia resolved and shewas in normal sinus rhythm. However , later that evening she wentback into ventricular tachycardia. She had stayed in ventriculartachycardia with her heart rate often reaching the 130s for severalminutes at a time. Her blood pressure was always stable in the90s/50s. She denied any chest pain. She was given an amiodaroneload of 150 mg IV x 1 over 20 minutes and also started on a p.o.load of 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. Over the next two days she continued tohave episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia for five minutesat a time and ultimately her ventricular tachycardia progressed sothat she would have episodes of 10-15 minutes at a time. When shebecame symptomatic she was started on an amiodarone drip. This wasdone through a peripheral line and after several hours the patientdeveloped a mild phlebitis. She was taken off the drip and placedagain on p.o. amiodarone. Her VTAC was thought to be primarily dueto her ischemic cardiomyopathy and we discussed the need for an ICDwith her. She was reluctant but ultimately agreed. We did alsodiscuss the possibility of an EP study and ablation but the patientpreferred the least invasive method possible. While the patientwas currently in compensated heart failure , as mentioned previouslyit was felt that this was because she did not exert herself anyfurther , and that it was likely that she would within the next yearor two , decompensate and have more symptoms of congestive heartfailure. Because of the severity of her disease a dual-chamberpacemaker was also placed at the same time as the ICD. The patienttolerated the procedure well. By the time of discharge heramiodarone was decreased to 200 b.i.d. This will likely bedecreased to 200 q.d. as an outpatient. She did not have any moreepisodes of VTAC.2 ) Endocrinology: We kept the patient on her same insulin regimenof 60 units in the morning and in the evening and covered her withan insulin sliding scale.3 ) Pulmonary: The patient will have pulmonary function tests asan outpatient given her therapy with amiodarone. At baseline shedid not have any pulmonary complaints.4 ) ID: When the patient was given IV amiodarone she did developphlebitis. Despite the fact that the amiodarone was quicklydiscontinued , she did develop what appeared to be a mildcellulitis. She was started on Keflex and her cellulitis resolved.During the hospitalization she also had a urinary tract infectionwith E. coli. We were limited in the antibiotics that we couldchoose. We did not want to use levofloxacin because of thepotential to prolong her QT given that she was taking amiodaroneand Elavil. She had an allergy to Bactrim which had a reportedhistory of renal failure. We were not able to find out any moredetails on this reaction. As a result we gave her a seven-daycourse of cefpodoxime given that the UTI was speciated to E. coli.5 ) Rheumatology: The patient has a history of gout. We continuedher allopurinol.DISPOSITION: The patient was sent home with her daughter. We didoffer for her to have VNA but she refused and feltthat her needs would be met at her daughter's house. At the timeof discharge she was not sure whether she was going to move back toher home eventually in the Ba or whether she was going tosell her home and move closer to family.FOLLOWUP: The patient has follow up appointments with Dr. Stuberand Dr. Buhr She will have pulmonary function tests.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Pravachol 10 mg p.o. once a day; Elavil 20mg p.o.q.d.; NPH 60 mg q. a.m. and q. p.m.;allopurinol 300 mg Monday , Wednesday , Friday; Glucotrol 10 mg p.o.once a day; Toprol 25 mg once a day; Lasix 40 mg once a day;Accupril 10 mg once a day; digoxin 0.0625 once a day; amiodarone200 mg twice a day; Keflex 250 mg p.o. x 2 doses; cefpodoxime 100mg p.o.q.d. x 2 days. Please note that we decreased the patient'sdigoxin dose from 0.125 to 0.0625 given the addition of amiodarone.Dictated By: AVERY F. MOLCHAN , M.D. WES MEMORIAL HOSPITALAttending: FREEMAN M.

Thepatient has a history of pulmonary embolism in 2000 , treated withLovenox and Coumadin. The patient also has a history of coronaryartery disease , status post non-ST elevation myocardialinfarction. She presented with chest pain in 2001 and had atroponin I , which peaked at 25. Cardiac catheterization revealeda left-sided occlusion and percutaneous coronary intervention wasunsuccessful. A subsequent adenosine mibi in September 2002revealed normal left ventricular function and no perfusiondefects. The patient has since been admitted for left chestpain , last in February 2005 , which has been attributed to hershoulder arthritis. She ruled out for myocardial infarction atthat time and chest CT scans were also negative. Today , thepatient was talking to her son on the phone when she went toretrieve a pen and her left knee gave out and she suffered amechanical fall to the floor. She struck her left foreheadagainst a dresser. She did not have any loss of consciousnessand also denied chest pain , shortness of breath , or palpitations.There were no focal neurological deficits and no activelyinflamed joints. She says that her left lower extremity ,especially her left knee is chronically unstable and weak. Inthe emergency department , the patient was afebrile. Her heartrate was 70. Her systolic blood pressure was initially 190 mmHg ,but subsequently came down to 150 mmHg without any intervention.A head CT was negative for bleed and a chest x-ray was negativefor infiltrate or effusions. She was admitted to Medicine forfurther evaluation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , hypertension ,hypercholesterolemia , osteoarthritis , polyarthritis with positiverheumatoid factor , and a positive ANA , spinal stenosis , pulmonaryembolism in 2001 , obesity , pseudogout , status post left totalknee replacement , history of right foot cellulitis ,gastroesophageal reflux disease , and history of colonic adenomas.ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Bactrim and shellfish.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include aspirin 325 mg , atenolol 25mg , Plaquenil 400 mg daily , lisinopril 60 mg daily , nifedipine 90mg daily , meloxicam 7.5 mg daily , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mgdaily , Lipitor 40 mg daily , Protonix 40 mg daily , and Colace 100mg p.r.n.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient's temperature was 96.2degrees , heart rate was 52 beats per minute , blood pressure was142/70 , respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute , and thepatient's oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. On physicalexam , the patient was lying in bed in no apparent distress andwas alert and oriented. The extraocular movements were intact.There is no scleral icterus with a mild proptosis and someperiorbital induration around her right eye , which was tender topalpation. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. Thelungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. On her cardiacexam , the patient had a regular rate and rhythm , a normal S1 withphysiological split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur , best heard atthe base. Abdomen was soft and nontender , with active bowelsounds. The patient's extremities were warm and well perfusedwithout edema. On strength testing , the patient had 4/5 strengthin her left knee extensors and left hip flexors; otherwise , allother muscle groups in her lower extremities were 5/5. Thepatient reports that her left lower extremity weakness ischronic. There were no effusions on either knee. Skin waswithout rashes.INITIAL LABORATORY DATA: Her sodium was 143 , potassium 3.4 ,chloride 107 , bicarb 28 , BUN 16 , creatinine 0.9 , with glucose of160.

LEFT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK ON ELECTROCARDIOGRAM.2. NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.3. HYPERTENSION.4. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.5. CHRONIC NECK PAIN.6. IMPOTENCE.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Tijerino is a 63-year-old man with ahistory of non-insulin-dependentdiabetes mellitus , hypertension , and chronic neck and shoulder painwho presented with a near syncopal episode and a new left bundlebranch block on EKG. He has a history of intermittent episodes ofsudden onset of an ill defined , non-painful sensation that shootsfrom the region of his left shoulder , up his left neck , and thenacross his head bilaterally. The episodes are usuallyinstantaneous. He does not know how often he has them , but doesnot think that he has had more of these episodes recently. He haspreviously been worked up for chronic neck and left shoulder painthat is attributed , in part , to a history of trauma. X-rays haveshown degenerative arthritis in the cervical spine , especially inthe region of C6 and C7 with evidence of foraminal narrowing andnerve root impingement. He also has evidence of multipleosteophytes in his cervical spine and in the region of his leftshoulder. He has had a normal head CT in 7/17 This pain hasbeen responsive to physical therapy and traction in the past.Today , he had a similar such episode while turning his head to theright while driving his car. The shooting sensation from hisshoulder up to his head was accompanied by a near loss ofconsciousness and was followed immediately by flushing withdiaphoresis and then weakness and dizziness that persisted forabout 5-10 minutes. He did feel nauseated , but did not vomit. Hedenied any chest pain , shortness of breath , or palpitations. Hepulled his car over to the side of the road and had his frienddrive him to TTFC. He continued to feel weak. He was noted atTFHC to have a left bundle branch block on his EKG that was newcompared to an EKG obtained in 8/3 He was , therefore , referredto Mibo Hospital for further evaluation andmanagement. On system review , he gives a history of dyspnea onexertion and exertional fatigue with shortness of breath that isrelieved by rest. This has not changed recently and seems stable.He also had stable three pillow orthopnea. He denied anyparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or swelling of lower extremities. Hiscardiac risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypertension , apositive family history , hypercholesterolemia , and he is a formersmoker.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

Glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.day. 2.Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.day. 3.Aspirin. 4. Terazosin 2 mg p.o. q.day. 5. Zantac 150 mg p.o.b.i.d. 6. Ativan p.r.n. 7. Percocet p.r.n.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease in hisfather who died of a myocardial infarction at age66. There is no family history of diabetes mellitus orhypertension.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a retired custodian. His wife diedin the last year , just after having undergone acoronary arterial bypass graft. He has three children who lives inthe area. He claims he quit smoking in 1990 after a 40 pack yearhistory.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature was 98.5 , heart rate between90 and 100 , blood pressure 144/96 ,respiratory rate 16 , and oxygen saturation 95% on two liters bynasal cannula. He appeared to be a middle aged man who wascomfortable lying in bed. HEENT examination was notable for a 5 mmnodule on the palpebral margin of his right upper eyelid. Sclerawere anicteric. Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light.Extraocular muscles were intact. Oropharynx was without anyevidence of lesions or without any adenopathy or masses. There wasno jugular venous distention apparent and no bruits heard. Hisneck was nontender to palpation. His back was nontender topalpation. No muscle spasm was palpable. His lungs were clear toauscultation bilaterally. His heart rate sounded somewhat fast ,but was regular. His heart sounds were distant with an indistinctfirst heart sound , but a second heart sound without evidence ofsplitting. No S3 was heard. There was a question of a fourthheart sound. There was also question of a grade I/VI systolicmurmur at the left sternal border and apex. He had good radial anddorsalis pedis pulses. His abdomen appeared obese with activebowel sounds. It was soft and nontender. His liver span wasestimated at 6 cm by percussion. He did not have any splenomegaly.His stool was heme occult negative. Extremities were without anyevidence of cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. His skin was warm andmoist without any lesions. Neurologic examination showed an alertand oriented man with fluent speech and 5/5 motor strength in hisupper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally. His touchsensation was intact in his lower extremities bilaterally. He hadnormal biceps and patellar deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. Histoes were downgoing on Babinski's test bilaterally.LABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes were within normal limits with BUN24 and creatinine 1.2. Serum glucose was 204.His white blood cell count was 7 , 900 , hematocrit 42% , and platelets282 , 000. His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin timeswere normal. His liver function tests were normal. Hischolesterol was 227 with triglycerides 311. His cardiac troponinwas 0.0. EKG , on admission , showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 30with the left bundle branch pattern that was new compared with anEKG from 8/3 His axis and intervals were normal. A chest x-raydemonstrated a right lower lobe opacity and bilateral pleuralthickening , no acute infiltrate , and no evidence of congestiveheart failure.HOSPITAL COURSE: The etiology of his symptoms was unclear , but hewas admitted to rule out myocardial infarction ,given the fact that he had a left bundle branch block pattern onhis EKG that was new compared to a previous EKG. It was not knownwhether this new EKG finding was acute or whether this had occurredsometime between 3/16 and the present time. He was started onheparin for the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. Hewas maintained on aspirin and started on a beta blocker. Hishydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. He was started onsimvastatin given his hypercholesterolemia. He ruled out for anacute myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes. He had anechocardiogram on 2/9/96 which demonstrated borderline leftventricular hypertrophy with low normal systolic function and anestimated ejection fraction of 45%-50%. No regional wall motionabnormalities were noted. He had mild left atrial enlargement ,mild mitral regurgitation , and mild tricuspid regurgitation. AHolter monitor on 2/9/96 showed a predominant rhythm of normalsinus rhythm with a few atrial premature beats and ventricularpremature contractions. There was no evidence of high gradeventricular ectopy. Because of his uninterpretable EKG , heunderwent exercise testing with MIBI imaging on 3/2/96. Heexercised for 6 minutes on a standard Bruce protocol. This wasdiscontinued due to fatigue. His heart rate increased frombaseline 58 to a peak of 94 , and his blood pressure changed from130/60 at rest to 140/50 at peak. His peak rate pressure productwas 13 , 200. His EKG was notable for left bundle branch patternwith 1 mm ST depressions. MIBI imaging demonstrated small apicaland septal rift consistent with mild ischemia. Because he remainedasymptomatic , and because his exercise test was without evidence oflarge areas of myocardium at risk , he was discharged home on3/2/96. He will follow up with his cardiologist for furtherevaluation as indicated. His medication regimen was optimizedduring his hospital stay.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.day. 2. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.day. 3.Hytrin 1 mg p.o. q.h.s. 4. Glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 5 mgp.o. q.h.s. 5. Zantac 150 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6. Simvastatin 10 mgp.o. q.day. 7. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually q.5 minutes asneeded for chest pain.DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: He was discharged home on a lowcholesterol , low saturated fat diet.FOLLOW-UP: He will follow up with his primary physician andcardiologist in the next week.Dictated By: ROCKY J.

The patient had IR guideddrainage of fluid collection done on 4/23 continued to draingreater than 700 mL per day. She had a repeat CAT scan on2/13/06 , which indicated large amount of ascites in the abdomenand pelvis. Fluid pockets where IR drain was placed were nolonger present. IR drain was planned to be removed by CIS.3. Melena. Upper endoscopy was consisted with evidence of smallshallow pyloric ulcers. No evidence of bleeding source. Thepatient was advanced to a full diet and was placed on a protonpump inhibitor and H. pylori were found.4. CVS.a. Elevated troponin , history of hypertension , no known coronaryartery disease , no chest pain , but does have dyspnea on exertionlikely secondary to severe anemia , demand ischemia ,ST-depressions on EKG since with the demand ischemia. Thispatient's serial troponins had been trending downward withaggressive rate control. She had a second episode of atrialfibrillation over the weekend of 11/20/06. The patient had anepisode which was converted with amiodarone. The patient hadelevated troponins that as stated above were turning down andsome ST-depressions on EKG , which was most likely secondary todemand ischemia. The patient had an echocardiogram whileinhouse , which showed normal left ventricular function. Noregional wall motion abnormalities.b. AVR , MVR. Heparin was stopped for therapeutic INR onCoumadin.c. Endocarditis. TEE. The patient had a transesophagealechocardiogram which was consistent with small vegetation on theaortic valve. She was placed on IV vancomycin , rifabutin , andLinezolid. She had positive cultures on 3/12/06 and then againon 2/6/06 both blood cultures from PICC line grew gram-negativecocci in clusters.

Shewas hypotensive; however , her CVP line showed a blood pressure of15-20 points higher systolic then what were showing on herperipheral blood pressure cuff. She had nosocomial pneumonia ,which had improved. Her ceftazidime was stopped and aztreonamwas stopped. Her ileus seemed to be improving. She had a bowelmovement. She also developed hyperbilirubinemia and thereforeamiodarone was stopped. Her NG tube was removed. Her abdomenremained tight from fluid overload. Her dialysis alternatingwith ultrafiltration. Fluid form her abdomen grew E. coli , onvancomycin. She was on Nexium orally. Her feeding tube wasplaced secondary to malnutrition and third spacing. She wasstarted on Mepron 10 mL per hour , meropenem was started on10/10/06 for a question of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.Plan was for paracentesis on 7/25/06. Renally , the patientremained anuric and dialysis dependent. FK was continued andCellCept was discontinued on 1/17/06. The patient continued tohave thrombocytopenia , neutropenia , and anemia. In the earlymorning of 5/28/06 , the patient began having large volume emesiswith aspiration. She was transferred to the medical intensivecare unit and resulted in respiratory arrest , pulses , electricalactivity arrest. A code was initiated with intubation. Thepatient decompensated and became very hypotensive. Despite theefforts of CPR , the patient became profoundly bradycardiac andadvanced to PA again , not responding. After 1.5 hour FR code ,efforts were discontinued.

LLE edema and groin pain: Given pain and fluid reaccumulation drainplaced by IR 9/9 and removed 11/8 Fluid was sterile with no evidence ofinfection. Drain was removed due to a concern for the risk of infectionof a sterile fluid collection , particularly given it's relative proximityto a joint and the risks that could be associated with a joint infectionin this woman. As per IR's recommendations , we asked our colleagues inorthopedics to participate in this patient's care. They had norecommendations for the short term given that her fluid collection hadbeen drained and she was pain free. Recommended that she could follow upwith Dr. Gene Alban in Orthopedic Oncology if her pain/fluid collectionrecurs.2. Pain control: Patient's pain was well controlled by IV morphine ( 2mgQ4-6 hrs ) after drain placement- only required one day of IV morphine.Following drainage of the fluid collection she noted that she was muchmore comfortable and was well controlled with ibuprofen and low dose MSIR( minimal requirement ). Will be discharged with prescription for MSIRshould her pain recur.3. Prophylaxis: Patient received one dose of therapeutically dosedlovenox pending the read of the MRI - then switched to prophylactic dosedlovenox.Patient remained full code throughout this hospitalizationADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have worsening of your leg/groin pain , you should contact youroncologist.If you have fevers or chill , nausea/vomiting , or shortness of breath , youshould contct your physicianYou were treated for a seroma/hematoma adjacent to your iliopsoas muscle.There was no evidence of infection based on the fluid collected from thisdrainage.

She has a history of chest pain since the CABG. The CABGconsisted of a LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein grafts to the OMB-2and RCA. In 9/16 , she had been cathed and a 70% RCA occlusion witha question of thrombus was seen. A 90% OMB-2 was seen; acircumflex of 60% was seen; an LAD of 70% was seen. An LV-gramshowed inferior akinesis and posterior hypokinesis with a leftventricular ejection fraction of 78%. Post CABG at baseline , shehad substernal chest pain at rest with rare use of sublingualnitroglycerin. She has a history of peptic ulcer disease which wasa duodenal ulcer with melena. She had an EGD in 5/20 which showedmild antral gastritis without ulcers. She is status postcolonoscopy in 9/16 which showed diverticulitis. She has a historyof anemia with a hematocrit of 29 , MCV of 68. She was treated withiron sulfate and H2 blockers. She noted a history in two months ofa 20 pound weight loss. One week prior to admission , she hadmelena of loose stool. She felt light-headed. She had a cough andnocturia. Three days prior to admission , she noted a stabbingperiodic epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting twice; no coffeegrounds or hematemesis. She had dysphagia for months to liquidsand solids with the sensation of aspiration on swallowing. She hada sharp pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath.The pain was similar to the inferior MI in 1988. On 2/4 , she cameto the emergency ward , where her blood pressure was found to be110/68 lying and 90/palp sitting. O2 sat was 97% on room air. HerJVP was 9 cm with crackles at the right base. She was given threesublingual nitroglycerins and Maalox. Her hematocrit was 20.8.She was given 10 mg of IV Lopressor from which she becamehypotensive , but this resolved. She was transfused three units ofpacked red blood cells , given Lasix and IV H2 blockers. She wentto the unit and ruled out for an MI by EKG and enzymes.

LAD showed100% proximal occlusion , LAD diagonal showed a 50% long proximaland circumflex showed a 50% proximal , OM-2 showed a 70% occlusionat the origin. There was a mild increase in right and left sidedpressures. She was readmitted to the floor and watched. Herhematocrit remained stable. She had an endoscopy done on themorning of 7/10 , and the impression was of a large hiatal herniawith no evidence of GI bleeding at this time. It was recommendedthat she had an upper GI and small bowel follow through or repeatcolonoscopy in the future as an outpatient. Her hematocritremained stable at approximately 33 for the past four days. Thesed rate was 25 , PT and PTT within normal limits , potassium 4.2 ,iron 182 , TIBC 432 , vitamin B-12 371 , folate 3.9 , ferritin 16 ,cholesterol 153 , triglyceride 112DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.;metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; nitroglycerin 1/150 0.4 mg sublingualp.r.n.

White blood cell count 3.1 , hematocrit 36 , platelets248 , INR 1.2 , EKG showed some new ST depressions in the inferiorand lateral leads that were new from prior. Chest x-ray; PA andlateral showed a new ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobelikely representing pneumonia. Chest CT without contrast showedno evidence of cavitary lesion within the lungs , a small area ofconsolidation within the right upper lobe consistent withpossible pneumonia. A nodule in the right upper lobe that was 8mm in size and stable from 2005 , but should be followed upapproximately every 6 months with follow up with CAT scan of thechest. There were coronary calcifications.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Infectious disease , the patient was admitted with a rightupper lobe pneumonia somewhat concerning for aspirationpneumonia , pneumonia given that she was found to have a largeamount of secretions upon admission. She was initially treatedwith vancomycin to cover for MRSA as well as ceftriaxone andazithromycin. She had nasal swabs that were negative forinfluenza A&P. She also had a PPD placed on May , 2006 ,that was negative. She had two sputum cultures that were sentfor AFB smears that were negative for acid fast bacilli. Hervancomycin was discontinued after 24 hours. She has completed a5-day course of azithromycin. She has to complete another 5doses of cefpodoxime have outpatient that should be admittedadministered three times a week after hemodialysis. The patienthad a chest CT that showed no evidence for a cavitary lesion.She does however have a pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobethat should be followed with interval CAT scans as an outpatient.The patient also had a beta glucan and serum tests that arecurrently pending. The patient has had negative culture data.She was initially placed on tuberculosis precautions , however ,given the absence of cavitary lesion on chest CT , negative PPDand negative sputum cultures , the likelihood of TB was thought tobe extremely low and her precautions were discontinued.2. Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient had a speechand swallow evaluation for concern of aspiration. She was placedon mechanical soft honey thick liquid diet that she shouldcontinue upon discharge. She will likely need a repeat speechand swallow evaluation while at rehabilitation and may possiblyneed a video swallow examination if she continues to show signsof aspiration. In addition , the head of her bed should be keptelevated. The patient was also noted to have hypercalcemiaduring this admission. The patient should have a serum proteinelectrophoresis as an outpatient for further evaluation.Currently , her calcium supplementation during dialysis has beendiscontinued. In addition , her PTH level is currently pendingand should be followed up as an outpatient.3. Renal: The patient has end-stage renal disease onhemodialysis. She undergoes hemodialysis Monday , Wednesday andFriday and she should continue this upon discharge at the Alllou Lorda Hospitalat Son Prai , 927 511 8904. She wasadmitted to the renal service.

After surgery the patientbecame hypotensive and ischemic. A new angiogram was performedwhich showed three vessel coronary artery disease , an occludedsequential venous graft to obtuse marginal and left coronaryartery , and a patent left internal mammary artery graft.The patient was reoperated; a new coronary artery bypass graft wasperformed on 23 of June , a new vein graft was placed to the rightposterior descending artery and another one to the obtuse marginal.An intra-aortic balloon pump had been previously placed and wasremoved three days later.OTHER EVENTS DURING HOSPITAL STAY: 1. Volume over-load forwhich the patient has stillsome fluid retention and is still being on diuretics.2. The patient underwent multiple interventions in her groins ,mostly for placement of arterial lines and intra-aortic balloonpump. Some hematoma developed but it never worsened. VascularSurgery was consulted but no further intervention was done.3. A very dubious diagnosis of cellulitis was done just after hersurgery for a redness and swelling in her leg and feet. InfectiousDisease was consulted and they ruled out the idea of cellulitis asthe patient has lichen ruber planus and Infectious Disease saidthat this was the reason for her redness. In the last two days ofher stay in our hospital , the redness became a little bit morevisible , and there was some question of increased white bloodcells , so it was decided to start her on Ancef and it should becontinued for about seven more days.4. The patient is on three days of levofloxacen treatment for aurinary tract infection.5. When the diagnosis of cellulitis was hypothized the first time ,a Doppler study of her lower extremity was done that showed noobstruction to venous flow.6. The patient also went for a period in atrial fibrillation andwas treated and converted to normal sinus rhythm with betablockers , namely Lopressor.CURRENT CONDITION: At present the patient is in stable condition ,afebrile , heart rate 81 in sinus , bloodpressure 120/60 , respiratory rate 20 , with a saturation of 96% inroom air. Her blood sugar is 189 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.8 , sodium137 , potassium 4.5 , bicarbonate 151 , white blood cells 10.7 ,hematocrit 28.4 , and INR 1.4.The list of medications is included in the discharge summary.Thank you for accepting this patient.Dictated By: ANTIONE SANZONE , M.D. KT11Attending: DANIEL M.

On the day of admission ,2/22/03 , she underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealedclean coronary arteries. On August , 2003 , she thenunderwent an elective mitral valvuloplasty , 26 Carpentier-Edwardspericardial , with size 26 Cosgrove-Edwards ring and vegectomy.In the immediate postoperative period , she was transferred to theCardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit initially requiring 0.5 ofepinephrine to maintain proper pressure. Epinephrine was weanedto off on postoperative day #1. She was extubated in the eveningof the day of surgery and epinephrine was subsequently weaned tooff. Gentle diuresis was begun on postoperative day #1 as wellas low dose beta blocker , which she tolerated well. She wastransferred to the Cardiac Surgery Step Down Unit onpostoperative day #1 , where diuresis was increased. Baby aspirinwas begun , and the patient continued to make excellentcardiovascular progress. On February , 2003 , she began tocomplain of some persistent numbness and tingling of the leftlower extremity , which she felt to be interrupting her attemptsto stand and maintain balance. For further treatment , aNeurology consult was obtained. Per Neurology , she was found tohave no weakness at the left lower leg and foot , although whenpressure was exerted on the foot , she reported an uncomfortabletingling throughout the leg. She reported no back pain and nochange in bowel or bladder control. Sensory examination wasfound to be intact , however , soft touch and pin sensation testedin the lateral leg below the knee caused a spreading tinglingsensation throughout the left lower extremity. Per Neurologyrecommendations , Neurontin 300 mg q.d. was begun and it wasrecommended that she follow up with the Department of Neurologyfollowing discharge if the tingling sensation has not improved.With aggressive diuresis , the patient was able to regain herpostoperative weight and by the day of discharge was 1.7kilograms below her preoperative weight. She has made excellentcardiovascular progress following this surgery and is anticipatedto continue her rehabilitation at home with VNA System.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese young woman alertand oriented x 3.

He was noted to behypoxic after a vomiting episode at his nursing home. He wasunable to provide a history but the events were recounted by thenursing home staff. On 10/9/05 , he had fevers to 101.5 andcongestion throughout the day despite getting nebs and oxygen ,his condition did not improve , he vomited twice and was noted tobe hypoxic to an oxygen saturation of 84% on 5 liters of O2 , healso had a temperature of 101.6 , a heart rate of 127 , a bloodpressure of 140/80 and was sent to the En Medical Center Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department , thepatient's vital signs showed a temperature of 102.6 , heart rateof 133 , respiratory rate of 24 , blood pressure 155/72 and 93%oxygen saturation on nasal cannula. His EKG initially showed STelevations inferiorly. He was evaluated by Cardiology who feltthat given his comorbidities and poor functional status he wasnot a candidate for cardiac catheterization. His EKGsspontaneously normalized without intervention. His first set ofcardiac enzymes was negative. His chest x-ray showed aleft-sided pneumonia and he had a white blood cell count of 34.He received 2 liters of normal saline , cefotaxime , and Flagyl.He also received Lopressor and aspirin. Of note , the patient hadbeen given Flagyl in the nursing home , which was started on10/4/05.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Of note , the patient had a recent medical history significant fora right thalamic hemorrhagic stroke , which resulted in lefthemiparesis on an admission 7/14/05 to 1/29/05 during which aVP shunt was placed that hospitalization was complicated by anaspiration pneumonia. He was readmitted on 2/6/05 to 10/21/05for a change in mental status during which he was givenantibiotics on and off for the VP shunt. He resolved during thishospitalization to baseline and was discharged to the nursinghome. Past medical history is also significant for history ofaspiration pneumonia status post a PEG tube 10/27 , diabetes ,hypertension , aortic stenosis , colon cancer and spinal fusion in2002.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Clonidine 0.2 q.a.m. , 0.4 q.p.m. , Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d. , HCTZ 25daily , Lantus 70 , lisinopril 40 daily , Norvasc 10 daily , Keppra1000 at bedtime , terazosin 2 at bedtime , omeprazole 20 daily ,Jevity 1.2 at 90 mL per hour with free water bolus of 240 mLq.i.d. , Colace , Senna , MVI.SOCIAL HISTORY:He lives alone , no smoking , no alcohol by report.

His cardiacenzymes on admission showed a CK of 79 , CK-MB of 1.3 and troponinless than assay. His UA was negative. Chest x-ray showed leftmid lung hazy opacity. Abdomen and pelvis CT showed no acuteprocesses. Head CT showed a right VP shunt and no acute changes.EKG as described above.CONSULTANTS DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:Included Cardiology for question of cardiac catheterization asdescribed above.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Pneumonia: The patient was thought to have a likelyaspiration pneumonia despite his PEG tube because of reportedvomiting at the nursing home. He was put on broad antibioticcoverage of vancomycin , ceftazidime , and Flagyl. He wascontinued on a 14-day course of antibiotics with clinicalimprovement. His antibiotics were discontinued after 14 days andhe remained afebrile with the normal white count. Of note , on2/16/05 , he had another episode of vomiting , which was thoughtto result in another aspiration event. However , repeat chestx-rays showed no additional pneumonia and given that he wastreated with a full two-week course of antibiotics it was decidedto end his course of antibiotics and he remained afebrile with anormal white blood cell count.2. Cardiovascular: The patient initially had ST elevationsnormalized. This was thought likely to be due to demand ischemiagiven its complete resolution. Per Cardiology recommendations ,he was not a candidate for long-term anticoagulation or cardiaccatheterization. He was continued on medical management withoutfurther incident.3. Hypertension: The patient was persistently hypertensive andhis blood pressure medications were titrated up and additionalmedications were added as described in discharge medication list.4. Diabetes: The patient's insulin regimen was titrated up tocover persistently high morning blood sugars given tube feedsovernight.5. Neurological: The patient had a baseline aphasia and wasdifficult to communicate with , however , as his pneumoniaresolved , his mental status improved and he was able tocommunicate with short phrases and answer yes or no questions.6. FEN: He was receiving tube feeds overnight per Nutritionrecommendations. He was also receiving NPH and regular insulinas described in discharge medications.7. C. difficile: The patient had some diarrhea and was testedfor C. diff. This returned positive and he was continued onFlagyl for a total of 3-4-week course as determined by the rehabfacility.CODE STATUS:Full code.Because of difficulty communication with the patient , it wasunclear what his exact code status was so he remained full code.His mother is his next of kin but due to her own medical problemsand a recent hospitalization , she was unreachable and it wasunclear whether she had capacity for decision making. There wasan ethics consult meeting on 4/4/05 to determine the goals ofcare. Per discussion at that meeting which is documented in themedical chart , It was decided that he remain full code. Thiswill need to be readdressed with Mr. Feltmann at some point when itcan be determined if he is competent for making this decision.Please see the chart for further details on the results of thisethics consult. Further questions regarding this can beaddressed to Dr. Lezama , the attending physician.DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:Significant for persistent aphasia , ability to answer questionsyes or no with occasional short phrases.

Glyburide 10 in the a.m. and 5 in the p.m.2. Digoxin 0.125 q.d.3. Probenecid 500 q.d.4. Multivitamin one tab q.d.5. KCL 20 mEq q.d.6. Celexa 20 mg q.d.7. Hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.8. Ativan 0.5 t.i.d.9. Coumadin 5 q.p.m.10. Isordil 40 t.i.d.11. Torsemide 200 b.i.d.12. Lisinopril 2.5 q.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with three daughters. She isan ex-custodian with past tobacco use but no ethanol use. Thepatient's family has no history of cardiomyopathy.SIGNIFICANT LABS ON ADMISSION: Normal renal function with a BNPof 1018 and no evidence of bandemia. EKG on admission showssinus tachycardia at 105 with normal axis , widened QRS , normalPR , and no evidence left atrial enlargement , and no change since1/25 Left heart cath in 1990.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular:Ischemia: The patient has no known CAD. She had a troponin atadmission of 0.12 , which subsequently went down to 0.10 less thanassay. It is thought to be secondary to right ventricular strainwith volume overload. The patient was initially started onaspirin and a statin; however , given her no evidence of CAD and anormal cholesterol panel , both aspirin and statin werediscontinued.Pump: The patient presented as "cold and wet" with poor forwardflows secondary to systolic dysfunction and likely increased SVR.The patient was started on dobutamine for improved inotrope.The patient was also put on a Lasix strip for diuresis after aloading dose. The patient was maintained on Isordil andhydralazine for pre and afterload reduction. Her ACE inhibitorwas held while on the Lasix strip. Metolazone also was used toimprove diuresis , and the patient was maintained on digoxin withlevel checks every three days. The patient underwent an echo ,which showed an EF of 15% , global akinesis withmoderate-to-severe MR , moderate TR , and no evidence ofdyssynchrony. The patient had moderate-to-severe RV dysfunction.Rhythm: The patient was maintained on telemetry , especiallygiven the fact that she had no ICD in place. EP was consultedand evaluated the patient for both an ICD and biventricular pacergiven no evidence of dyssynchrony on echo , it was decided thatthe patient would undergo ICD placement only.2. Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.1 on admission and wasmonitored closely with diuresis. On admission , she had a normalUA.3. Heme: The patient was placed on heparin instead of Coumadinfor Chronicle device lead thrombus with a PTT goal of 60-80. Thepatient's platelets dropped from 222 to 166 during this admissionand tests were ordered for the HIT antibody. The patient'splatelets normalized , but unfortunately , the PF4 was positive.It was felt that this was a false positive and this was confirmedwith a Heme consult. Heme recommended rechecking the PF4 inthree to four weeks and holding heparin products until the PF4was rechecked. The patient would be restarted on Coumadin afterher ICD placement.4. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on sliding scaleinsulin and Lantus for diabetes management.5. GI: The patient had right upper quadrant pain on admissionlikely related to a congested liver. A right upper quadrantultrasound showed a normal liver with thickened gall bladderwalls and ascites , and her symptoms were improved with diuresis.The patient was maintained on Nexium for prophylaxis.6. Psych: The patient was continued on citalopram and Ativanfor depression and anxiety. Psych was consulted for assistancewith management.7. Musculoskeletal: The patient was maintained on probenecidfor gout.8. Prophylaxis: The patient was on PPI and heparin until shewas on the HIT positive and was placed on Pneumoboots forprophylaxis.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: To be determined at the time ofdischarge.eScription document: 2-0840228 HKDictated By: WISHUM , TIMOTHYAttending: ABRAHAMS , PHILIPDictation ID 7971599D: 10/9/05T: 1/27/05

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.2. HYPERTENSION.3. ASTHMA.4. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.5. HISTORY OF MELENA.6. LOW BACK PAIN.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old black femalewith a past history of hypertensionand congestive heart failure who presented to the emergency roomwith increasing shortness of breath. In April 1991 , the patientstates that she had a bout of a cold with coughing and chills andsome substernal chest pressure. In October 1992 , the patient hadone 10-minute episode of substernal chest pain associated withnausea , sweating and shortness of breath. Since then , she relatesincreasing shortness of breath on exertion , paroxysmal nocturnaldyspnea , orthopnea and ankle edema. She also has been coughing upmore mucus and at times , blood-stained. She also complains ofdysuria for approximately the past month without hematuria. InOctober 1992 , she had one episode of melena which lasted twoweeks. There is no history of peptic ulcer disease. PAST MEDICALHISTORY: Past medical history is remarkable for:1. Asthma since early 20's. She was intubated once for asthmain her early 20's.2. Hypertension since she was a child.3. History of congestive heart failure.4. Hysterectomy secondary to fibroids at approximately age 20.TAH , BSO.5. Question of chronic renal insufficiency.Medications at the time of admission are Lisinopril , Procardia ,Albuterol nebulizer. Allergies are to IVP contrast. Familyhistory is positive for hypertension. Social history - she liveswith a 23-year-old son and just suffered a family tragedy in thedeath of her youngest son who was shot to death three years ago.Habits - she smokes 1/2 pack a day. She has over a 30-pack yearsmoking history. She does not drink or engage in illicit drug use.Review of systems is otherwise negative.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , this is a moderately obeseblack female in moderate respiratorydistress. Temperature is afebrile , blood pressure 160/90 , pulse84 , respiratory rat 32 , O2 saturation 97% on two liters nasalprong. Head and neck exam showed significant jugular venousdistention. Chest showed diffuse expiratory wheezes , some use ofaccessory muscles. Cardiovascular exam had an S1 and S2 with nomurmur. The abdomen was obese , otherwise benign. The liver edgewas 12.0 - 14.0 cm by percussion. Rectal exam was guaiac negative.Extremities had no cyanosis or clubbing but 1+ bilateral ankleedema. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. Musculoskeletalexam - there was an area of left paravertebral tenderness in thelumbar sacral spine area.LABORATORY DATA: On admission , hematocrit 35.1 , plateletcount 246 , 000 , white count 9000 with 65%polys , 1% bands. ABG on unclear FIO-2 was pH 7.48/37/73/95.5%saturation. SMA-7 was significant for a BUN 19 , creatinine 1.4. PT12.3 , PTT 31.7. Urinalysis was positive for traced blood andleukocytes , too numerous to count white blood cells , 7-10 red bloodcells and 4% bacteria on microscopy. Urine culture grew klebsiellasensitive to Bactrim. EKG was sinus at a rate of 80 , axis -29degrees , intervals of .196/.116/.1478 , marked left ventricularhypertrophy with left atrial abnormality with strain pattern inV3-V6. Chest X-ray was significant for moderate pulmonary edema.Lumbar sacral plain films showed no significant bony disease. AnEchocardiogram showed a severe left ventricular hypertrophy ,preserved systolic function , possible diastolic dysfunction and newposterior wall hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery disease.HOSPITAL COURSE: Renal ultrasound showed both kidneys tobe approximately 11.0 cm in size. Norenal artery stenosis was seen though it was a limited study due tobody habitus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was carried out by the GIservice and no significant lesions were found. The patient wasdiuresed for congestive heart failure to which she responded well.Her breathing was significantly improved by the second hospitalday. It is felt that her hypertension has contributed to at leastclinical evidence of her failure. While in the hospital , the bloodpressure was difficult to control and eventually required the useof three medications. At the time of discharge , she was runningblood pressures in the range of 140-150 systolic and diastolic of90 which is much improved for her. A repeat urine culture wasnegative and the antibiotics were stopped. Her low back pain wasfelt to be muscular in origin and she was given Flexeril for this.She has no history of peptic ulcer disease but it has been decidedto institute a trial of H2 blocker therapy and reevaluate the needfor upper GI endoscopy in three weeks time. Her asthma wasrelatively quiescent but it has been stressed to her that sheshould continue to use her puffers.DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is stable.MEDICATIONS at the time of discharge areBeclovent 4 puffs b.i.d. , Ventolin 2 puffs q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mgp.o. b.i.d. , Habitrol nicotine patch q. day , Procardia XL 90 mgp.o. q. day , Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q. day , Labetalol 200 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Flexeril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day.

Her cardiac riskfactors include a positive family history but no diabetes , nocholesterol , no hypertension , and no history of tobacco use. Thepatient was in good health until two days prior to admission. Atthat time , she noted 2/10 substernal chest pain radiating to theleft arm accompanied by shortness of breath and dizziness. Therewas no nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis. The pain lastedapproximately 45 minutes and did not change with activity orposition. The pain and shortness of breath recurred approximatelytwo times that day. She had a fourth episode on the morning ofadmission while watching television. She went to the Mali Medical Center where there was no improvement. An EKG there showedflipped T waves across her precordium. The patient improved withoxygen there. The pain recurred during an ambulance ride to theNortion Memorial Hospital where it was again relieved withoxygen. The patient has no prior history of chest pain ,palpitations , or shortness of breath. She denies orthopnea ,paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , edema , or previous dyspnea onexertion. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Chronic low back pain. PASTSURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cesarean section in 1986. CURRENTMEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: Tylenol with Codeine. FAMILYHISTORY: Both her mother and father died of myocardial infarction ,the mother at age 50 and the father at age 74. The patient has asister who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft at age 37. Thepatient denies alcohol , tobacco use , and drug use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese Hispanic woman whowas in no acute distress. Her bloodpressure was 110/80 and her pulse was 100 and regular. HEENT:Examination was within normal limits. NECK: Supple. CHEST: Clearto auscultation and percussion. CARDIOVASCULAR: Examinationshowed no jugular venous distention , S1 and S2 were regular with noS3 , S4 , or murmur , and carotids were 2+/2+ with no bruits. ABDOMEN:Obese , soft , and non-tender with good bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES:Femorals showed no ruits , there was no cyanosis , clubbing , oredema , and there were 2+/2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialpulses bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: The patient was alert andoriented , cranial nerves II-XII were intact , and strength andreflexes were symmetric.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , cholesterol was 202 ,triglycerides 316 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.3 ,hematocrit 42.2. EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm at arate of 92 and an axis of negative 12. Intervals were 0.17 , 0.07 ,and 0.35. There was evidence of poor R wave progression andflipped T in leads V1 through V6.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 32 year old woman with no prior cardiachistory who presents with chest pain at rest. Shehas a strong family history and high triglycerides which makes usquestion if there is a genetic predisposition for coronary arterydisease. Her EKG is clearly abnormal , however , it is unclear ifthese are new or old changes. Patient was put on a rule outmyocardial infarction protocol and started on Nitrol Paste ,Lopressor , and Aspirin. Her CPK initially were 243 with 2 MB andlater decreased to 202 , 141 , 132 , and 88. An echocardiogram doneduring this admission showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mildhypokinesis of the inferoposterior walls , and slight apicalhypokinesis of the right ventricle with a question of priorinfarction. The patient underwent an initial exercise test duringwhich she went three minutes and 23 seconds on a standard Bruceprotocol. There was no evidence of ischemia. On a second exercisetest , the patient completed seven minutes of a Bruce protocolstopping secondary to dyspnea and leg fatigue. An EKG during theprotocol showed minimal ST depressions in the inferior leads withrecovery and flipped T in the anterior leads. The impression wasthat there was no evidence for ischemia although the patient didnot achieve a maximal heart rate. There appeared to be diminishedexercise tolerance. Patient was discharged with a follow-upappointment in the TER GENERAL HOSPITAL Clinic.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ecotrin 325 mg oneq.d. , Micronase 5 mg p.o. q.d. , and sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n.chest pain.XI535/4023VAN THAMAN , M.D. KB1 D: 1/9/92Batch: 0655 Report: R7927F59 T: 2/6/92Dictated By: HARRY R.

He has complex cardiovascular history andprogressive symptoms of heart failure. He had CABG in 1980 and1990 and multiple PCI most recently in 6/29 with intervention onSVG to the PDA. He had MVR in 1980 with bioprosthesis. He hadimplantation of a CRT pacemaker with ICV function in 3/7 Hishistory of heart failure dates back ten years , but he has hadmore marked decline over the past two years currently has SOBtypically , does not have orthopnea , PND , or leg edema. He hasbeen admitted to the Mid-lo Caldent Medical Center several times formanagement of CHF in 1/14 After diuresis he states he couldwalk up to 30 yards on a flat surface , but could not walk upsteps. He was at baseline until 3/29/05 when he had recurrentepisodes of chest pain respondive to sublingual nitroglycerinassociated with diaphoresis , nausea , palpitations , andlightheadedness. On 10/17/05 , he had acute onset of shortness ofbreath at rest after eating. He was admitted to the Ctr Medical Center and treated with diuresis and anticoagulation. MI wasexcluded by serial enzymes. He was noted to be anemic. Otherlab values were consistent with hemolysis. As a part of hisworkup , during ETT MIBI , he was able to walk 2 minutes 52 secondson the standard Bruce protocol , peak HR 94 , echo showed a dilatedLV , EF of 34% , mild global hypokinesis , and septal and apicalakinesis , enlarged dixed defect in the inferior apical wall withmoderate fixed defect in the inferior apical segment , and a smallamount of reversibility was noted in a mild inferior lateraldefect. Echocardiogram at CMC on 5/13 showed EF of 35% , septaland apical akinesis , with normal RV function , mitralbioprosthesis , mildly elevated antegrade velocities , mildperivalvular regurgitation , moderate TR , moderate pulmonaryhypertension , SVP of 48 mmHg and PA plus RA pressure , transferredfor evaluation and management of chest pain at Slifarb Hospital with ? need for catheterization.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CHF , EF is 25% , atrial fibrillation ,chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 , mildCOPD , status post AAA repair in 1995 , BPH , TIA/CVA , anemia , onhome O2 , status post AICD , pacer , status post sinus arrest in1993 , ischemic cardiomyopathy , CAD , status post mitral valvereplacement , porcine valve placed in 1980 , and status post CABGx2.

He has undergonemultiples attempts of revascularization including CABG x2 ,repeated PCI , most recently in 6/29 with intervention on SVG.Revascularization options at this point are quite limited , theamount of active ischemic burden suggested by his recentsubmaximal MIBI ETT is unlikely to account for the severity ofthe symptoms that he is experiencing. Unfortunately , his overalldebilitated state makes surgical intervention unlikely to betolerated. He was moderately overloaded at the time of arrivaland was aggressively diuresed. An echocardiogram was performedon 7/24/05 , which showed moderate known perivalvular mitralvalve leakage and an EF of 30%. A right heart catheterizationwas performed on 8/23/05 which showed RA pressure 7/7 , mean 5;RV 52/1 , mean 4; PA 54/17 , mean 34; and PW 21/40 , mean 23. Insummary , overall dry after aggressive diuresis; however , withlarge amounts of mitral regurgitation. For this reason , it wasdiscussed with the family possible clamping for his mitral valveas he is not a candidate for mitral valve replacement given hisend-stage heart and generally frail state. Plan as of the timeof this dictation is to undergo TEE on 2/18/05 to evaluatewhether clamping of the mitral valve would be possible and thento have mitral valve clamping later this week. The patient wasdiuresed effectively with Lasix 200 mg IV b.i.d. with metolazone.The patient was also started on digoxin and Aldactone. He had abump in his creatinine to 2.2 on 10/3/05 and then it continuedto rise and for this reason diuresis was held as of 2/10/05. Asfor rhythm , paced , normal sinus rhythm , on telemetry. O 2/6/05brief round of V-tach , paced out of it. An AICD and pacer inplace.Pulmonary: COPD. On O2 at home , however , with increaseddesaturation here in the hospital to mid 80s while walking ,thought secondary to his extreme mitral valve regurgitation. OnAdvair , Combivent , and albuterol nebulizer.Renal: Elevated creatinine in mid 2s , baseline CRI creatinine1.5 , and all medications were renally dosed.FEN: Potassium and Magnesium scales , b.i.d electrolytes givendiuresis.Heme: Hemolytic anemia with bilirubin of 3.0 likely secondary tomitral valve regurgitation , not surgical candidate , baselineunknown. Given transfusion on 2/7/05. Transfuse forhematocrit less than 30. PTT goal of 60 to 80 on heparin.

The patient then reportedly went into VFib and wasshocked once by EMS , resulting in a narrow QRS complex rhythm.She was intubated , received amiodarone and dopamine , as her BP wasapproximately 70s systolic over palpable diastolic. In the ED , a portablechest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral opacities , risk of pulmonary edema andABG showed respiratory acidosis. Pt was transferred to the ICU for furthermanagement.Of note , she was recently hospitalized at Somver Vasky University Of Medical Center on 7/1/06through 10/11/07 for initiation of dialysis after her BUN and creatininehad risen remarkably from baseline. She was then asymptomatic atthat time. A fistulogram and angioplasty of her right AV fistulawas performed on 7/6/06 with prednisone premedication but itwas unsuccessful and therefore a left IJ tunneled dialysiscatheter was inserted on 1/18/06 with the tip ending in theright atrium. She has since received dialysis treatments with nocomplication.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease ,CHF , echo in July of 1999 shows moderate left ventricularhypertrophy of about 65% , diabetes type 2 20 years including withretinopathy , nephropathy and neuropathic pain , hypertension forthe past 20 years , hypercholesterolemia , status post medullaryCVA July 1999 , right PICA resulting Wallenberg's syndrome ,morbid obesity , left knee degenerative joint disease ,iron-deficiency anemia.ALLERGIES: IV contrast , which gives her anaphylaxis ,tetracycline to an unknown reaction , lisinopril.HOME MEDICATIONS: At the time of admission include amitriptyline25 mg p.o. bedtime , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily ,enalapril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Losartan50 mg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Advair Diskus250/50 one puff inhaler b.i.d. , insulin NPH 50 units q.a.m. subcuand 25 units q.p.m. subcu , insulin lispro 18 units subcu atdinner time , Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily , sevelamer 1200 mg p.o.t.i.d. , tramadol 25 mg p.o. q.6 h. p.r.n. pain.SOCIAL HISTORY: This patient is single and has one son and onegrandson. Arturo Randklev is the healthcare proxy and is her son.She worked 30 years for Wi Co Baya and is currently retired.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Her vital signs weretemperature 97.6 , heart rate 72 , BP of 115/66 with mean arterialpressure of 83 , respiratory 14 , sating 100% on 60% inspired FiO2.Her CVP at admission was 17 to 20. The patient is an obese woman who wasintubated and responded to voice. Her pupils were 3 to 2 mmbilaterally. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her chestexam was notable for diffuse crackles throughout with good airmovement. Cardiac auscultation revealed regular rate and rhythmwith no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Her abdomen was soft ,nontender and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.Extremities showed no edema. Distal pulses were not palpablebilaterally. She has thickened hyperpigmented skinchanges on both feet.LABORATORY DATA: Significant labs on admission included a sodiumof 141 , potassium 4.1 , chloride of 102 , bicarb of 31 , BUN 33 ,creatinine 4.2 with a glucose of 156. Her hematocrit was 32.An ABG at 10 p.m. of admission on FiO2 of 60% revealed a pH of 7.36 , pCO2 of52 , pO2 91. Her first set of cardiac enzyme revealed acreatinine kinase of 116 and the MB fraction of 0.7 and troponinT of less than assay and lactate of 1.8. Tox screen wasnegative. Urinalysis was remarkable for 2+ protein , 3+ blood andpositive for nitrates , and negative for leuks , 4 to 10 whiteblood cells , 15 to 25 red blood cells , 2+ bacteria , 1+ squamousepithelial cells.IMAGING: Significant imaging at admission was an x-ray for chestx-ray revealing diffuse bilateral opacities , possible pulmonaryedema versus aspiration pneumonia , an EKG showing normal sinusrhythm 100 beats per minute with no acute ST changes and oldT-wave inversion in V2.ASSESSMENT: This is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renaldisease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetes who had an apparentVFib arrest at hemodialysis on 7/8/06 and was shocked andadmitted to the CCU after being intubated in the Vibay General Hospital ED. Thepatient had difficulty weaning from vent and was finallyextubated on 11/11/06. The CCU course was also complicated bycoag-negative Staph grown from a Quinton catheter blood draw.The catheter was changed to over a wire on 11/11/06. Bloodcultures on 10/24/06 revealed likely Staph aureus growth forwhich the patient received continuous vancomycin.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:1. Question of VFib arrest. Whether or not the patient actuallyhad a VFib arrest seems to be in some doubt as she never had anarrhythmia on tele here by report and her troponin when peaked at0.14 on 3/25/06 after receiving one external defibrillator shockat hemodialysis. We believe what likely happened was a vagal event duringhemodialysis , possibly including a pause misread at VF by the defibrillator.This explantation is supported by the observation that she has beencontinuously having nausea with dialysis and her known a historyof vasovagal episodes in the past. Echo on 3/25/06 shows an EFof 60 to 65% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophyand no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was continued ontelemetry and treated with her home dose of beta-blocker withgood response.2. Volume status. The patient is very close to her dry weightupon discharge , which she gives at 354 pounds by wet scale. Shehas been continued on hemodialysis with good results.3. Possibly infected hemodialysis catheter. The patient had asingle set of coag-negative Staph positive blood cultures fromQuinton catheter on 11/12/06. Line was changed over wire7/28/06 and was treated with vancomycin dose by renal levels.The patient continued to grow out coag-negative Staph , positiveblood cultures from 2 out of 2 sets drawn on 8/30/06.4. Anemia. In the setting of end-stage renal disease herbaseline hematocrit is about 30 and stable.5. Diabetes type 2. She was treated with a Portland protocolduring her ICU course wand was switched to a long andshort-acting subcutaneous insulin approaching her home dose of NPH BID.6. FEN. The patient was gradually advanced to an oral diet withno signs of aspiration status post extubation.7. Prophylaxis. The patient received heparin subcutaneously andNexium.8. Code. The patient is full code. Her healthcare proxy is herson Noble Schomberg , 284-659-2493.DISPOSITION: This patient will likely need rehab and is beingscreened by PT and OT and will likely be discharged to rehab whenbed is available.eScription document: 7-7801705 CSSten TelDictated By: ARTOLA , GARYAttending: DIX , REGGIEDictation ID 0252108D: 1/17/06T: 1/17/06

Today on the date of admission thepatient had a steroid injection in his cervical spine , which hetolerated well. He did well until 5:30 p.m. when , while resting inbed , he noted left-sided chest pain radiating to his left upperarm , no shortness of breath , diaphoresis or palpitations. He didnot try any particular treatment and came to the emergency room.The pain had increased in intensity to 10/10. In the emergencyroom initial EKG showed T compression in V3-V6 , three lead. With 3sublingual nitroglycerin and 2/10 , 5 mg IV Lopressor made him painfree. There was no resolution of his ST changes. He hadrecurrence of chest pain two hours later in the emergency room.Left-sided chest pressure was similar quality to the previous whilelying on the stretcher. His EKG showed flattened T wave changes inV4-V6 , ST depression 1 mm V4-V6 , evolved he had a T wave inversionin V3-V6 when pain free. He was started on heparin and IVnitroglycerin.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes hypertension , adult onset diabetesmellitus , history of renal calculi , benignprostatic hypertrophy , increased triglycerides , history of malariaand typhus and dengue fever , history of proteinuria.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Captopril , Micronase and Darvon p.r.n.ALLERGIES: Penicillin , which makes him itch.SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with his wife.

His right coronary artery was also noted to haveluminal irregularities. Posterior descending artery was noted tohave a 90% mid stenosis. Systolic function showed EF of 71%. On11/10/95 the patient underwent successful balloon angioplasty of theproximal 95% stenosis of the left circumflex. On 8/4 the patientcomplained of chest pressure , underwent an exercise tolerance test ,5 minutes and 1 second , stopping secondary to leg fatigue. He had2 mm ST segment depressions consistent with severe coronary arterydisease. On 11/1/95 the patient underwent a second cardiaccatheterization followed by successful angioplasty of his midposterior descending artery lesion with 30% residual stenosis and asmall intimal dissection of the inferior margin of the vessel. Thepatient did well following this and was discharged home on thefollowing medications.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day; Micronase 5 mgp.o. q day; nitroglycerin tabs 1/150 onetab sublingual q 5 minutes; enoxaparin , study drug for TME-11 , 60mg subcu q 12h; Lisinopril 7.5 mg p.o. q day; Atenolol 75 mg p.o. qday.FOLLOW-UP: He will be following up with Dr. Schlichenmaye , his primaryphysician , and with Dr. Mcclenton , cardiology.Dictated By: LOUIS JAQUISH , M.D.Attending: MARY U.

He presented asymptomatic from homeafter being called by his primary cardiologist as the lab resultshowed elevated BUN and creatinine at 244/4.1. This all occurredin the setting of increased diuresis on torsemide , increasing thedose from 100 mg by mouth twice daily to 150 mg by mouth twicedaily as well as a recent addition of Keflex for sacral decubitusulcer. On further questioning , Mr. Satoe reported symptoms ofincreasing dyspnea on exertion with decreased exercise toleranceas well as chronic loose stools with a history of C-diffpositivity but negative on last testing. He denied any chestpain , pleurisy , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and both he andhis family denied any change in mental status as well ashematuria or dysuria , although he did complain of mild urinaryhesitancy. Prior to presentation , he was directed to hold hisdiuretics , included torsemide as well as all other nephrotoxicagents including allopurinol , colchicine , digoxin , andlisinopril.His allergies include heparin to which he has heparin-inducedthrombocytopenia.In terms of medication reactions during this hospitalization , hewas placed on H. pylori treatment with amoxicillin ,clarithromycin , and Nexium twice daily; and in reaction to this ,he had mild elevation of his liver function tests.BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL: Mr. Blackmer is A&O x3 with a BP of90/60 , heart rate of 84. His lungs are bilaterally clear. Hisheart exam shows a regular S1 , S2. Faint S3 with a 1/6holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex with a JVD of 12 cmplus V waves. His abdomen is benign. Extremities show no edema ,but a left lower extremity petechial rash. He is found to beheme positive with tarry stool , and he has a stable stage 4sacral decubitus ulcer , well granulated without clear evidence ofinfection.Admission labs are significant for creatinine of 3.6 , BUN of 239 ,potassium of 5.8 , digoxin of 1.7 , hematocrit of 29.3 , INR 4.1.Admission EKG showed sinus rhythm with a first degree AV block.Stable Q's in II , III , aVF , as well as V4 to V6. Left axisdeviation and right bundle branch block and an unchanged STdepression in V2.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: 11/19/2005 , right heartcatheterization with PA line removal on 6/1/2005. 9/10/2005 ,upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. 6/12/2005 , echocardiogram.6/12/2005 , renal ultrasound.HOSPPITAL COURSE:1. Mr. Kristin presented with acute and chronic renal failurewith baseline BUN and creatinine at approximately 66/2.4 with arapid rise between presentation and the last noted value on11/15/2005. Although , he was asymptomatic and did not have anyEKG changes , he was treated with Kayexalate and sodiumbicarbonate which resulted in rapid normalization of potassium.The superelevation of his BUN was thought in part to be due topossible over diuresis but also complicated by the fact that hehad Hemoccult positive stool as suspicious for a GI bleed as asource of increased nitrogen. The renal service was consultedand initial treatment of his acute renal failure included theabove plus removal of all fluid restriction and diuresis in orderto reverse any potential prerenal state. Essentially , all urineand renal studies including eosinophils and renal ultrasound werenegative with a renal ultrasound showing normal kidneys withouthydronephrosis but without increased resistance in the feetbilaterally. At the time of discharge , his creatinine and BUNhad fallen to 1.9/81 respectively and remained stable over days.The initial renal diet restrictions imposed during thehospitalization were removed towards the end of the stay withpersistently stable values as well.2. From a cardiovascular standpoint , a repeat echo on 9/12showed an EF of 35 to 40 with inferior wall and inferior septalsevere hypo to akinesis as well as posterior wall severehypokinesis with trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ mitral valveregurgitation , 2+ tricuspid valve regurgitation but normal leftventricular size and thickness as well as normal rightventricular size function. In order to better assess his fillingpressures and fluid status and attempt to optimize his renalfunction , Mr. Marthaler underwent a right heart cath with PA lineplacement on 11/19/2005 which revealed elevating fillingpressures including right atrium at 26 to 27 , right ventricle65/13 , PA 64/32 , wedge 36. Pulmonary artery sat 39% , SVR 1568 ,and pulmonary vascular resistance 221. His cardiac output andindex were both reduced. The PA line was left in for tailortherapy , and he was initially placed on nesiritide drip at 0.005as well as a Lasix drip with good urine output and increase inhis cardiac output and index and decrease in his elevatedsystemic vascular resistance. On 10/6/2005 , the nesiritide dripwas discontinued and Lasix continued with the addition ofshort-acting nitrates in the form of Isordil. Eventually , he wastransferred from the Lasix drip to torsemide reaching optimaldose of 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. on 2/10/2005 , and further tailoringwith Imdur 30 and hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for furtherafterload reduction were preformed. Lisinopril previously usedon admission was continuously held given the recent acute renalfailure.3. From an ischemic standpoint , there were no active issuesduring the hospitalization. His beta blocker was reduced to 12.5briefly , but his normal dose of 25 once a day was resumed priorto discharge. In terms of his rate , it was well controlled onthe above regimen , but his rhythm showed frequent ectopy withoutresponse to diuresis or beta blockade. He does have an ICD inplace which never fired during the course of the hospitalization.Upon discharge , he was close to euvolemia with an approximatedischarge weight of 67.6 kg.4. From a GI standpoint , his initial presentation includedheme-positive tarry stools with elevated BUN. He was seen by theGI service and underwent a colonscopy and upper EGD which weresignificant for gastritis without signs of active bleeding aswell as internal hemorrhoids. H. pylori serologies werepositive , and he was initially started on clarithromycin ,amoxicillin , and Nexium b.i.d. , but this regimen was changed toamoxicillin , Flagyl , and Nexium b.i.d. given an elevation of hisLFTs on the prior regimen. There was no overt GI bleeding , andhe tolerated the procedure without complication.5. From a nutrition standpoint , Mr. Splatt was seen by anutrition specialist who confirmed suspicion of suboptimalcaloric intake meeting his total caloric needs about only 60% andtotal protein needs are 85% despite labilization of his diet andthe addition of Megace. His nutritional goals were even moreimportant given his large stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer withpoor healing since January 2005. Despite encouragement and theaddition of appetite stimulants with vitamin C , zinc , mineral ,multivitamins , and the addition of supplements , he presently fellshort of his goals but refused other means of dietsupplementation including NG tube placement and PEG placement andis determined to provide adequate p.o. intake by mouth. He andhis family met with a registered dietitian and understand theimportance of his caloric intakes.6. From a musculoskeletal point of view , he has stage 4 sacraldecubitus ulcer which is followed by plastic surgery andfrequently debrided as an outpatient , Dr. Bastress and his team ,followed the patient while inhouse , and it was treated as perprotocol with b.i.d. dressing changes with Panafil and wet-to-drydressings. Initially , he was started on Keflex for suspicion ofinfection in the wound , and this was changed to vancomycin givenMRSA growth in the wound and further Klebsiella growth which wastreated with levofloxacin , but these were all discontinued on10/6/2005 as per plastic recommendations given the highprobability colonization. It was also felt that theseantibiotics would provide appropriate coverage for the possibleright lower lobe infiltrate questioned on x-ray.7. From an endocrinology standpoint , he has a history of diabetestype 2 , and he was continued on his Lantus and NovoLog insulinsliding scale with titration of optimal glucose control in orderto promote wound healing. He was followed by the diabetesmanagement team.8. From rheumatologic standpoint , he has a history of gout , andhe was maintained on allopurinol , renal dosing , but colchicinehelps. On about 1/6/2005 , he developed symptoms of podagra ,and a prednisone taper starting at 15 mg was started with quickresolution of symptoms.9. From hematologic standpoint , he has anemia baseline and takesProcrit once a week as an outpatient. He received 1 unit ofpacked red blood cell transfusion on 8/18 and maintained hishematocrit throughout the remainder of the hospitalization. Hewas also maintained on darbepoetin as an inpatient.Laboratory data showed no evidence of hemolysis with a normalhaptoglobin and LDH , but evidence of decreased iron saturation.He was started on iron supplementation , and his Coumadin was heldfor the supratherapeutic levels on admission and optimize priorto discharge.PERTINENT EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Patient was afebrile with stablevital signs.

LFTs within normal limits.Coags within normal limits. BNP 46 , CK-MB 0.9 , troponinsnegative. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversions , V3through V5. Chest x-ray shows enlarged heart with right middlelobe opacity.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Pulmonary: The patient with possible right middle lobepneumonia versus CHF versus exacerbation versus COPD versus PE.The patient is found to have pneumonia. She is afebrile withnormal white blood cell counts but continues to be hypoxic to themid 80s on room air. Sputum cultures were sent and the patientwas treated empirically with Levaquin. Levaquin was given for atotal of 8 doses in-house and the patient will continue for atotal of 14-day course. The patient had a PECT , which wasinitially read was positive , however , the final read was negativefor PE. The patient initially received a dose of Lovenox 100 mgb.i.d. but was discontinued given negative PE. The patient wasseen by Pulmonary Service who performed the bronchoscopy on6/14/05 , which showed a copious blood-tinged mucosa andcollapsed right middle lobe lung with narrow orifice. Brushingsand cytology were taken and sent to Pathology and the results arestill pending. The patient's pulmonary function test showedsevere obstructive disease with the FEV of 0.9 with some aspectsof restrictive disease. She also underwent a bubble study , whichwas negative for heart septal defects. The PA pressure wasestimated at 42. The patient then underwent a right heartcatheterization to check for vasodilator response and heartfunction. This was performed on 10/10/05 , which showed highright-sided heart pressures and a pulmonary wedge pressure of16-18 and suggested that the patient was not in acute left heartfailure. The patient was also seen by the Ookter Highway ,Pulmonary Hypertension Consult Service , whose impressions werethat the patient's poor pulmonary function is due to COPD andpectus cavernosum as well as radiation for breast cancer and ischronic condition. No indication was present for treatment withprimary pulmonary antihypertensive agents. The patient then hada repeat chest x-ray on 10/10/05 to evaluate for the right middlelobe , which continues to be collapsed. The patient was stable on2-3 L of nasal cannula oxygen , saturating at about middle 90s.The patient was re-evaluated by physical therapy on 3/29/05 andwas found to not need any particular treatments at home. Thepatient was discharged to home with home O2 2-3 nasal cannula andinstructed to keep O2 saturations above 88%. The patient doeswork in the hospital. The patient's work situation anddisability regarding her lung condition was discussed by theattending physician.2. Cardiovascular: The patient is stable with no evidence ofacute CHF , complicating dyspnea. The BNP was normal and JVPremained relatively flat throughout her hospital course. Thepatient was continued on her outpatient hypertensive medications ,which was captopril and that was given t.i.d. with good control.The patient was also on Lasix 40 mg daily , which was thenincreased to 60 on day of discharge to encourage gentle diuresis.3. Endocrine: The patient has diet-controlled diabetes at home.She was on insulin sliding scale and house and required onlyseveral units of insulin a day. Her blood sugars remained in themid 100s.The patient was on Levoxyl 225 mcg daily in-house and was foundto have a increased TSH of 10.5 , therefore dose of Levoxyl wasincreased to 250 mcg. The patient is instructed to follow upwith her primary care provider and her endocrinologist in twoweeks to recheck a TSH.4. Musculoskeletal: The patient complaining of leg cramps ,chest spasms , and back pain. Back pain appears chronic. Chestspasms appeared to be musculoskeletal in etiology and notcardiac. The patient was on oxycodone 5 mg q.4h. p.r.n. and thentransitioned to OxyContin 10 mg b.i.d. with good pain control.5. Social Services: The patient was seen by Social Servicesregarding prescription coverage , ability to handle copayments.Additionally , her concerns regarding short-term disability andlong-term disability for work were addressed. The patient is toinquire with her benefit office to determine for services.DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with home O2.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Levaquin 500 mg daily for six more days ,captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. daily ,levothyroxine 250 mcg p.o. daily , Xanax 0.25 mg t.i.d. p.r.n. ,OxyContin 10 mg p.o. q.12h. , Combivent 1-2 puffs q.i.d.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient to call if becoming short ofbreath , has chest pain , fever over 100.5 or any other concerns orquestions.FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: Include 10/17/05 at Bayhead Medical Center forsleep study where the patient is to arrive before 09:00 p.m. thatnight , 10/25/05 with Dr. Chesterman at 02:30 p.m. for primary carefollow-up , Dr. Hilse on 7/18/05 at 04:00 p.m. for follow-up ofpulmonary issues and a two weeks' time follow-up with herendocrinologist regarding her thyroid condition.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: COPD , pneumonia , secondary pulmonary hypertension ,hypothyroidism , hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetes.eScription document: 5-1803670 CSCC: Berry Althoff M.D.Scdi Of CenterGarl Ren Ley AColn Eans PeCC: Walton Grady M.D.Pulmonary Division , Scotcoke Reph ClinicMong Worth Sifontheights , WYPit War YuwarknasCC: Burchess her primary care providerDictated By: MCCALPIN , TEDAttending: SALAZA , EMILEDictation ID 0676572D: 4/19/05T: 4/19/05

G V P VI.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 49 year old lady was admittedwith increasing shortness of breathand increasing abdominal girth in a setting of known dilatedcardiomyopathy on the cardiac transplant list.Her history extends back to 1995 when she was fist admitted withshortness of breath and an ejection fraction of 15% with 3+ mitralregurgitation in a setting of excessive alcohol use. Hercardioangiogram at that time showed right dominant system withoutcoronary artery disease and her exercise stress test revealed a VO2of 12.6. The presumptive diagnosis at that time was alcoholicrelation dilatation cardiomyopathy. In 11/18 she represented withan ejection fraction of 20% with moderate mitral regurgitation andleft atrial enlargement and she was treated with digoxin , diureticsand ace inhibitors. It subsequently was revealed that there was astrong family history of dilated cardiomyopathy and , in fact ,subsequently two of her sons , ages 13 years old , were diagnosedwith dilated cardiomyopathy and her diagnosis was therefore alteredfrom alcoholic to familial cardiomyopathy. In 10/22 she wasadmitted with acute pancreatitis and developed acute renal failurerequiring intubation. Her stay was complicated by Staphylococcalbacteremia. She recovered but presented again in 11/13 with ahistory of progressive shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion ,orthopnea , PND and abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting andanorexia. She required dobutamine and IV Lasix and had an episodeof nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. In 11/10 she presentedwith syncope in the presence of a potassium of 2.4 and wasdiagnosed with Torsades de Pointes in the setting of hypokalemiaand acute TC of 0.68. In 3/14 she represented with an ejectionfraction of 20% with a left ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis andrequired IV diuresis. In 3/26 she had a laparoscopiccholecystectomy for multiple gallstones. In 1/20 she was admittedfor cardiac transplant evaluation and found to a VO2 of 9.2 , a DLCLof 62% predicted and she was negative for PPD. She was admitted in9/18 for IV diuresis and potassium repletion , and again in 5/12with abdominal distention and orthopnea. Pancreatitis was ruledout at that stage and she was again treated with IV Lasix. Sherepresented on her last admission on 23 of September with congestive heartfailure requiring intravenous Lasix , Aldactone , Diuril andZaroxolyn , ultimately requiring dobutamine for inotropic supportfor a short period of time.On this admission she gives a history of two days of increasedshortness of breath with orthopnea and mild PND with diminishedexercise tolerance. She has been reluctant to combine torsemideand her regular intravenous Lasix at home which was given to her bythe VNA and feeling increasingly shortness of breath she was takento the emergency department at Ield Hospital There she wastreated with 200 mg of IV Lasix and had a 1.2 liter diuresis , feltbetter , and was transferred to this hospital for further evaluationand management.SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married with four children and she isan ex-smoker for the last year , previously 10cigarettes a day for life and previously a heavy drinker up to 1-2liters of spirits per day.FAMILY HISTORY: As above shows strong family history of dilatedcardiomyopathy , with her mother dying at the ageof 36 from a sudden cardiac death , her grandmother dying at the ageof 52 from what appears to have been cardiomyopathy , and two of herbrothers dying at the age of 32 and 42 with heart related problems.Two of her sons as I mentioned were diagnosed with dilatedcardiomyopathy , one of whom remains quite unwell.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Amiodarone 200 mg once a day; Diuril500 mg once a day; digoxin 0.625 mg oncea day; Colace 100 mg twice a day; Aldactone 25 mg once a day;Torsemide 100 mg in the morning , 15 mg in the p.m.; K-Dur 100 q.a.m.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Alert and oriented , in nodistress. She was comfortable. Evidence oflabored breathing. Her pulse was tachycardic at 103 withrespiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 84/58. Hertemperature was 98.2. She had diminished radial pulsesbilaterally. She had borderline proptosis with a jugular venousdistention at the angle of the jaw. She had no bruits and nothyromegaly. She had a loud S3 and S4 with a dynamic precordiumand a displaced PMI with a quiet MR. She had a palpable S4. Herrespiratory examination showed her lungs were markedly clear topercussion and auscultation without wheeze. Abdomen was mildlydistended without evidence of shifting dullness. Bowel sounds werenormal. She had an inverted umbilicus. She had no peripheraledema and good peripheral pulses.Chest x-ray showed a large globular heart without fluid in thebases with mild upper lobe venous diversion. Electrocardiogramshowed normal sinus rhythm with a left axis and ventricularconduction defect and left ventricular hypertrophy high voltage.LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 140 , potassium 3.6 , white count 6.6 ,hematocrit 37.9. Cardiac enzymes were normal. Inote her right catheterization results of 4/22/99 showed a meanright atrial pressure of 12 , right ventricular pressure of 38/14 , amean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 21 with a cardiac indexof 2.88 , and a cardiac output of 4.93 and an SVO of 1022.IMPRESSION: This was a 49 year old lady with dilatedcardiomyopathy , probably familial in nature , withincreased abdominal girth and shortness of breath , on thetransplant list , admitted for diuresis , plus or minus optimizationtherapy.HOSPITAL COURSE: She was initially treated with b.i.d. Lasix 200mg IV and had an excellent diuresis on thisregimen. We increased her Aldactone to 50 mg once a day to try andobtain better potassium control and eventually we added metolazoneat 2.5 mg in the morning. During her admission she had a verysignificant improvement with negative diuresis of almost 2 litersevery day for the past 3 days. She had a cortisol stimulationtests which revealed normal synthetic adrenal function and she hada normal TSH. She required extensive potassium repletion duringher stay and she is discharged on 120 total of K-Dur per day.During her hospital stay her glucoses were over 250 for a shortperiod of time and it was felt that it was probably appropriate tostart her on oral hypoglycemics. However in the setting ofchanging her diuretic medications and a hospital diet , this wasconsidered this could be delayed until her next outpatient visitwith Dr. WeiglebDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d.; amiodarone 200 mgq.d.; digoxin 0.0625 mg q.d.; M.V.I.therapeutic 1 tablet q.d.; K-Dur 14 mEq t.i.d.; Aldactone 50 mgq.d.; Torsemide 100 mg b.i.d.; Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg q. o.d.; Coumadin 5mg q. h.s.CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.DISPOSITION: To home with VNA for Coumadin , potassium checks andintravenous 200 mg of Lasix p.r.n.FOLLOWUP: She will follow up with Dr. Pucket next Wednesday andshe will have her potassium checked tomorrow in the CMCOlaboratory , result of which will be forwarded to Dr. Gracia and anynecessary change to her K-Dur therapy will be managed therefrom.Dictated By: OLEN WARDSWORTH , M.D. TI15Attending: ORVILLE J.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.2. REACTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE.3. HYPERTENSION.4. MORBID OBESITY.BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 60-year-old African-Americanfemale with a recent , eleven-day hospitalization atthe Brentcal Hospital for a congestive heart failureflare. The patient presents now with two days of progressivelyworsening shortness of breath at rehabilitation. The patientpresented initially with chest pain and CHF , and was ruled out fora myocardial infarction , in early October . An echocardiogram thenrevealed mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction and abnormalseptal motion , with septal apical hypokinesis and minimal mitralregurgitation. An exercise treadmill test at that time was withoutischemia , though her target heart rate was not achieved. Duringthe hospitalization at that time , the patient was slowly diuresedand then discharged to rehabilitation. At rehabilitation , she hasbeen chest-pain-free , but she has had increasing shortness ofbreath and wheezing. In the emergency department , she was found tobe in congestive heart failure by chest x-ray. The oxygensaturations were 93% on 2 liters. She was given albuterol andAtrovent nebulizers and IV Solu-Medrol , and was also given a doseof 120 mg of IV Lasix.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Please see the Problem List.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: The patient has had the followingsurgeries: ( 1 ) A cholecystectomy; ( 2 ) TwoCaesarean sections.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Ventolin two puffs p.o. q.i.d. ,Azmacort four puffs b.i.d. , Rhinocorttwo puffs b.i.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol25 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Motrin 800 mg p.o. q.d. ,Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Claritin 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Cozaar 75 mgp.o. q.d. , Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,and nitroglycerin sublingually p.r.n.LISTED ALLERGIES: Lisinopril gives her a cough.SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol use and no IV drug abuse.The patient works in the Chand O Rock , Virginia 48456 atthe Ham Greatsilove Hospital .PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the vital signs include thefollowing: the temperature is 98.0 degreesF. , the pulse 87 , the blood pressure 180/110 , and the respirations24. The oxygen saturation is 92% on 2 liters. In general , thepatient is a morbidly obese female in mild to moderate distress.The neck is supple , without bruits; the jugular venous pressurecannot be assessed secondary to the patient's body habitus. Thecardiovascular examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with anS1 , an S2 , and an S3 , and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at theright upper sternal border and a 2/6 murmur at the left uppersternal border. Examination of the lungs is significant for ralesbilaterally in one-third of the lung fields. She also hasinspiratory and expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratoryphase. The abdomen is soft , non-tender , and non-distended , with nomasses. The extremities show 2+ pitting edema in both lowerextremities and the pulses are 2+ in the dorsalis pedis andposterior tibial arteries. On neurological examination , thepatient is alert and oriented times four. The neurologicexamination is otherwise non-focal.DATA BASE: The admission chest x-ray showed moderate congestiveheart failure with moderate pulmonary edema but noacute infiltrate. The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with arate of 60 , a normal axis , and no ST-T wave changes when comparedto prior EKGs from October 2000. The admission laboratory studieswere as follows. The sodium was 140 , the potassium 4.0 , thechloride 99 , the CO2 39 , the BUN 23 , the creatinine 0.9 , theglucose 78 , the CK 114 , the troponin 0.00. The white count was8 , 200 , the hematocrit 44 , and the platelets 315 , 000. The PT was11.8 , the PTT 23.1. The cholesterol level was 206.HOSPITAL COURSE: By problems:1. CARDIOVASCULAR. The patient was re-admitted to the Wakeview Hosp Of Valley with worsening congestive heart failure on a doseof Lasix of 40 mg p.o. q.d. She received 120 mg IV Lasix in theemergency department and her diuresis was continued with aggressiveintravenous Lasix until two days prior to discharge , when she wasswitched to p.o. Lasix. She was started initially on 120 mg of IVLasix once a day , which resulted in a diuresis of 1-2 liters everytwenty-four-hour period. The patient was ruled out for myocardialinfarction by serial enzymes and EKGs. The decision had been madeduring the last hospitalization to manage her coronary arterydisease medically. The patient did not desire cardiaccatheterization at this point. She was eventually switched to oralLasix at a dose of 60 mg by mouth twice a day.2. RESPIRATORY. The patient was admitted to the hospital forcongestive heart failure but also had evidence of reactive airwaydisease on clinical examination. She had profound inspiratory andexpiratory wheezes and shortness of breath. Due to the history ofreactive airway disease , the patient was started on intravenousSolu-Medrol , albuterol , Atrovent , and Serevent. She was givensupplemental O2 to maintain her oxygen saturations greater than93%. She was continued on her IV steroids throughout thehospitalization , and these were eventually switched to p.o.prednisone near the end of the hospitalization and were to betapered on an outpatient basis. Her shortness of breath resolvedby the time of discharge.3. FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES. Due to the aggressive diuresis , thepatient developed a contraction alkalosis during the course ofhospitalization. Her bicarbonate rose to a level of 43 , with a BUNof 34. At this time , the diuresis was withdrawn slightly and thepatient's electrolytes normalized.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler two puffs q.i.d. ,enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Robitussin with codeine 5 ml p.o. q.4h. ,Atrovent inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o.t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mgsublingually p.r.n. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o.q.h.s. , Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Serevent two puffs inhaled b.i.d. ,Claritin 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Flovent 220 micrograms inhaled b.i.d. ,Cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d. , and a prednisone taper with 60 mg p.o.q.d. for three days , then 50 mg p.o. q.d. for three days , then 40mg p.o. q.d. for three days , then 30 mg p.o. q.d. for three days ,then 20 mg p.o. q.d. for three days , then 10 mg p.o. q.d. for threedays.DISCHARGE CONDITION: Improved.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home.Dictated By: CARMEN O.

The liver edge was nonpalpable. There was nospleen tip palpable and bowel sounds were present. The extremitieswere notable for no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and were warm andperfuse. Neurologically , she was alert and oriented x 3 withintact cranial nerve. Her strength and sensation were grosslyintact , 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities. Her toes weredown-going bilaterally and her reflexes were symmetric in the upperand lower extremities. Rectal examination was guaiac negative.DATA: Laboratory values upon admission showed electrolytes withinnormal limits. Magnesium was 1.1. White count 6.5 ,hematocrit 48 , platelets 200. Differential: 78 polys , 1 band , 12lymphs and 8 monos. MCV was 104. RDW was 14. ALT 140 , AST 605 ,alkaline phosphatase 119 , and total bilirubin was 2.6 with a directfraction of 1.5. Lipase was 319 , amylase was 44. Her INRs were1.1 and her prothrombin time was 19.9 Troponin was 0.22.Chest x-ray was notable for no infiltrates or evidence of heartfailure.EKG was notable for sinus tachycardia at 117 with a Q-wave of 3 andQ-wave in V2 and V3. Q-wave inversions were noted in V3 and V6with no chest pain.Urinalysis was notable for 2+ protein , trace keto , 3+ blood , 2+leukocyte esterase , 28 to 30 whites and 2+ squamous cells.ASSESSMENT: In the emergency room , the patient was acutely treatedfor presumed sepsis and received a dose of ceftriaxoneand clindamycin. Urinalysis results indicated that she had apotential urinary tract infection at that time. Blood cultureswere drawn and the patient received IV hydration. Her EKG wasnoted to have new T-wave inversions as compared to previously withan indeterminate troponin. She was admitted to medicine formanagement.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's hospital course can be summarizedas follows:1. Cardiovascular: The patient has no known cardiac history. Hercardiac risk factors include cigarette smoking and postmenopausalfemale , age 51. No diabetes mellitus. No knownhypercholesterolemia. No known family history. She does , however ,drink heavily and has done so for a number of years. She has noknown cardiotoxic effect secondary to alcohol.The T-wave inversions were noted with an indeterminate troponin.The patient was admitted in a rule out protocol. She ruled out foran myocardial infarction with serial CKs which were all below 50.Her T-wave inversions persisted despite resolution of her sinustachycardia. An echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrateddilated left ventricle of 5.6 cm and an ejection fraction of 25 to30% with inferoseptal and inferoseptal apical akinesis. Noventricular thrombus was noted.Cardiology consultation service was asked to see the patient toevaluation her in the setting of her new depressed ejectionfraction and focal wall motion abnormalities. Initially , she waspresumed to have coronary disease which had been clinically silentprior to this. She was treated with aspirin , Lopressor andCaptopril 6.25 mg three times a day. Unfortunately , the patient'sblood pressure did not tolerate this antihypotensive regimen and ,despite efforts to scale it back in dosages , the majority of themedicines were held. Nevertheless , the patient's heart rate slowedto the 60s. She experienced one episode of burning chest pain onthe night of admission which was alleved with Maalox. There wereno EKG changes associated with that pain.The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on SeptemberThe cardiac catheterization was notable for a right atrialpressure of 5. Right ventricular pressure of 36/10. Pulmonaryartery pressure was 35/13 , and the pulmonary capillary wedgepressure was 16. Her cardiac output was 6.13 with an index of3.69. The left heart catheterization noted normal coronaryarteries without evidence of significant coronary disease. Herleft ventriculogram also noted a preserved ejection fraction withno focal wall motion abnormalities. Dr. Garret Dalrymple of thecardiac consultation service followed the patient in house and feltthat the reversal of her wall motion abnormalities could beattributable to the acute effects of alcoholic cardiotoxicity. Thepatient will be discharged on aspirin for primary prevention ofcoronary disease , as her other medications were discontinued. Thepatient was heparinized for her apical wall motion abnormality andlow ejection fraction while in house and the heparin wasdiscontinued at the time of catheterization.2. GI: The patient presented with an acute elevation of hertransaminases. The patient's transaminases were noted to be lessthan 10 in September of 1998. Initially , it was felt that thesetransaminases might reflect alcoholic hepatitis given hersignificant alcohol history. The patient reports that her lastdrink was on Sunday prior to admission. She drinks about a pint ofbrandy every day. The patient's transaminases continued to rise ,however. The diagnosis of acute Tylenol toxicity superimposed uponhepatocellular damage from alcoholic hepatitis was alsoentertained. She was empirically started on naphthyl cystine andreceived approximately two to three doses , however , that medicationwas discontinued upon GI consultation. The patient's transaminasesrose to a level of approximately 4000 AST and 1000 ALT , and the GIservice was consulted. The patient's hepatitic serologies weresent and were notable for positive hepatitis B core antigen ,whereas the rest of her hepatitis serologies including hepatitis C ,hepatitis A and hepatitis B surface antigen were negative. The GIservice felt that her hepatocellular injury was most likelyattributable to an ischemic "shock liver" condition. She had aright upper quadrant ultrasound as well which demonstrated adilatation of the common bile duct to 1 cm with some biliarysludging but no evidence of obstructive lesions. Given thepatient's isolated increase in AST and ALT and bilirubin without anincrease in alkaline phosphatase , the diagnosis of ischemichepatotoxicity was entertained by the GI service. On the date ofdischarge , the patient's ALT had fallen to 221 and her AST hadfallen to 50. Her total bilirubin had fallen to 1.1. The patientwas asymptomatic from hepatic perspective throughout herhospitalization without any evidence of encephalopathy orasterixis. An isolated ammonia level was sent and it was 45.3. Infectious disease: The patient had a repeat urinalysis thatwas sent on the morning following admission which was indicative ofurinary tract infection. Urine culture eventually indicated aninfection with Enterococcus. The patient received seven days ofampicillin while in house , following her initial first day dosingof ceftriaxone and clindamycin. The patient's urinary tractinfection clear symptomatically. She developed a yeast infectionin her vulvar area secondary to antibiotic therapy and this wastreated with topical Nystatin. The patient was not discharged onantibiotics as she clinically cleared her infection.4. FVN: The patient had persistent hypomagnesemia while in houseand required significant magnesium repletion. The etiology of thishypomagnesemia was unclear; however , it was attributable to herchronic alcohol use and depletion of total magnesium stores. Herelectrolytes clearly need to be followed closely as an outpatient.5. Hematologic: The patient's INR slightly increased while inhouse but this is attributable to heparin bolus andsupratherapeutic prothrombin time. Upon discharge , the patient'sINR had normalized. She received vitamin K 10 mg x 3 days asempiric treatment for vitamin K depletion secondary to chronicalcoholism as well as the possibility for hepatic syntheticdysfunction.6. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation forhypotension was attributable to dehydration; however , it becameclear that the patient normally exists with a low normal bloodpressure of approximately 80 to 100 systolic. It was stressed tothe patient that she must maintain adequate p.o. intake to maintainher circulating blood volume , as she seemed to be intolerant to theantihypotensive medicines that were used for cardioprotection. Arandom cortisol was drawn and was normal. The issue of potentialrenal insufficiency was most likely excluded. The patient willfollow-up on endocrine and electrolyte issues with her primarydoctor.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.day , Nystatintopical cream , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,multivitamin one q.day and aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day.FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Elroy Forcell inMES GEERT MEDICAL CENTER on March . Dr. Aamodt was involved in thepatient's hospitalization and will provide excellent continuity ofcare as an outpatient.Dictated By: PORFIRIO FUSSNER , M.D. AI86Attending: STACEY C.

InAugust of 1992 , she had quadruple bypass surgery with LIMA to theLAD and saphenous vein graft to the PDA , OM2 and diagonal branch.She was feeling generally well until the beginning of April athome. From June , 1997 to January , 1997 , she was inO and began to experience intermittent episodes of diaphoresis.These tended to occur with ambulation on a flat surface , althoughshe did have one episode that awakened her from sleep. The secondtime this happened , she went to the Faxtpaul Dekan Health Care there in Tonwith the complaints of diaphoresis and some nausea , although shedid not have chest pain , shortness of breath , vomiting orpalpitations. No EKG was done at the time. She said that she wasdefinitely more comfortable lying or sitting than standing. It isof note that she had had her Beta blocker , Pendalol decreased from5 mg to 2.5 mg prior to this trip to Glension Street On return to theGene Er Za , she had upper respiratory and pharyngeal symptomswith low grade fevers and a cough productive of a green sputum.This was treated with Amoxicillin given to her by her son who is apharmacist. These symptoms gradually resolved and she saw Dr.Jessie on March , 1997 and was given a clean bill of health.At this visit , he did start her on Prinivil. Since she had beenhome from Er Dr. , Win Ca S , she really had not had repeat episodes ofdiaphoresis. Then on the day of admission when she went shoppingand had a recurrent episode of diaphoresis while carrying bags ,this time with substernal chest pain that radiated down both arms.She also had a general sense of heaviness across her chest. Shedrove home and took a sublingual nitroglycerin that completelyresolved her pain. She describes this pain as exactly like theanginal pain that she had prior to her coronary artery bypassgraft. The total duration of this episode was approximately tenminutes. By the time she presented to the Emergency Room , she hadno diaphoresis and no chest pain and was feeling perfectly normal.The latest echocardiogram in April of 1997 showed an ejectionfraction of 35% with mid to distal septal and apical akinesis andinferior akinesis with mild mitral regurgitation. In July of1997 , she went 4 minutes and 18 seconds on an exercise tolerancetest with Thallium which showed only fixed defects , no reversibledefects.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease andcoronary artery bypass graft with cardiacrisk factors of hypertension , family history and high cholesterol ,hypothyroidism and remote peptic ulcer disease with history ofcholecystectomy and appendectomy.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Zocor 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. 2 ) Prinivil5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Pendalol 2.5 mgp.o. q. day. 4 ) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Synthroid 0.100mg p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday and Friday and 0.12 mg p.o. Tuesday ,Thursday , Saturday and Sunday. 6 ) Pepcid p.r.n.ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Full Quer Dienson with her husband andhas two married sons. She does not smoke anddrinks wine occasionally.FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 58and her brother had a coronary artery bypass graftat age 79 and she has a sister with Alzheimer's disease.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , elderly woman inno apparent distress. Vital signs:Temperature 99.4 degrees , heart rate 87 , blood pressure 115/78 ,respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The restof the physical examination was significant for a clear oropharynx.Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascularexamination was regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 and a two out ofsix systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border withno gallop or rub. Abdomen was soft with good bowel sounds.Extremities revealed no edema. Neurological examination wasnon-focal. Rectal examination was guaiac negative with no masses.LABORATORY: Laboratory studies were significant for a white bloodcell count of 5.46 , hematocrit 40.1 , platelets 190.Cardiac Troponin I was 0.0. CK was 102. Urinalysis was negative.Chest x-ray was clear with no infiltrates. EKG was normal sinusrhythm with normal intervals and normal axis with a left bundlebranch block pattern and first degree atrioventricular block withno change compared to an EKG done on March , 1997.HOSPITAL COURSE: The impression on admission was that this is awoman with known coronary artery disease statuspost coronary artery bypass graft who is now experiencing unstableangina with diaphoretic episodes , both at rest and exertion and nowsubsternal chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction.On April , 1998 , she had a standard Bruce exercise tolerancetest in which she went 3 minutes , 30 seconds and stopped because ofchest pain. This was typical of anginal pain and resolved eightminutes into recovery. The EKG had no changes with a left bundlebranch block at baseline and this was considered to be consistentwith but not diagnostic of ischemia. She subsequently underwentcardiac catheterization which revealed patent grafts with her knownunderlying native disease. Her right atrial pressure was 4 , rightventricular 46/8 , PA 42/22 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 19.From here , she was managed medically with increases in her ACEinhibitor , Statin and the addition of nitrates. After the cardiaccatheterization , she developed a large right groin hematoma at thepuncture site and a bruit was noted.

Morbid obesity.2. Diabetes.3. Hypertension.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old womanwith morbid obesity ( greater than 330 pounds ) , hypertension ,diabetes mellitus who presents with one week of increasingdyspnea on exertion. She notes that she can no longer walk fromroom to room without resting and she used to be able to walkaround her house. She also notes a frequent need to "get air"which also wakes her from sleep. She often opens the window ,turns on the air conditioning , etc. when she feels short ofbreath. She started sleeping on two pillows over the past fewweeks. She also reports an intermittent increase in her legswelling and a cough productive of scant clear to whitish sputum.She was unable to name her home medications , but stated that shetook four medications plus insulin which is in accordance withher LMR notes. She has not been able to check her fingerstickblood glucose levels recently because her machine has beenbroken. She denies chest pain , tightness except with coughing.She denies pleuritic pain , any recent illness , any sick contacts ,any change in urinary or bowel habits , any nausea or vomiting ,night sweats , diaphoresis or pain in her jaw or arms. Of note ,her GIES HEALTH primary care physician , Dr. Miquel Crayford , note fromSeptember 2004 noted tachycardia greater than 100 with decreasedexercise tolerance , inability to lie flat , and snoring anddaytime sleepiness. At this time , an echocardiogram performed inJanuary 2004 revealed an EF of 60 to 65% , trace PR and no regionalwall motion abnormality.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension. BilateralDVTs in 1972. The patient is not currently on anticoagulation.She was on Coumadin for one year following this event.Dysfunctional vaginal bleeding. Fibroids. Type II diabetesmellitus. Morbid obesity. Pituitary microadenoma.HOME MEDICATIONS: ( Per LMR - the patient confirms these as bestshe can recollect ).1. HCTZ 25 mg daily.2. Glucophage 500 mg PO b.i.d.3. NPH insulin 60 q.a.m. , 20 q.p.m.4. Lisinopril 40 mg.5. Iron supplements.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco use , alcohol use ,drugs. She lives with her daughter who is one of her fourchildren , and eight of her 14 grandchildren in OttebaShe does not work.FAMILY HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes mellitus. No known MI's.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.8. Heart rate137 , down to 98 with 5 mg of IV Lopressor in the EmergencyDepartment. Blood pressure 156/98 , satting 95% on room air. Ingeneral , the patient is an obese , pleasant woman in no apparentdistress. HEENT: Extraocular muscles are intact. Mucousmembranes moist. No JVD. Cardiovascular exam revealstachycardia , S1 , S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops but heartsounds are distant and difficult to assess. Lungs: Decreasedbreath sounds throughout secondary to body habitus , but nocrackles or wheeze noted. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,nondistended. Extremities warm and well perfused. Bilateralpitting edema to shins. Derm: No ulcers or lesions.Hyperpigmentation noted around neck and under breasts. GU exam:Very trace guaiac positive stool.ADMISSION LABORATORY RESULTS: Notable for a blood glucose of190 , BNP of 271 , and hematocrit of 32. ??_____?? EKG: Sinustachycardia at 118 with no ST or T-wave abnormalities. Chestx-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema. Noinfiltrate. PE protocol CT ruled out central PE and showed asmall right pleural effusion.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Cardiovascular:Ischemia: The patient had cycled electrocardiograms andbiomarkers. These were negative for myocardial ischemia or anyacute change. The patient was maintained on aspirin , Lipitor 80mg , beta-blocker , and ACE inhibitor. The patient underwentcardiac catheterization on 8/10/05 which revealed a 50% LADlesion , a 70% D1 lesion. These lesions were not intervened uponat the time of dictation. This patient is awaiting viabilitystudy.Pump: The patient underwent echocardiography on 5/19/05. Thefindings of that study were very concerning revealing ejectionfraction of 20 to 25% , sharply decreased from EF of 60 to 65% inJanuary 2004. In addition , the study revealed global hypokinesiswith septal akinesis.Rhythm: The patient has remained tachycardic and has beenmonitored on tele with no noted abnormalities. On the night of8/10/05 following cardiac catheterization , the patient had a 13beat run of nonsustained V. tach on telemetry. She receivedelectrolyte optimization and close monitoring. Following thisepisode , the patient's cycled cardiac biomarkers revealed atroponin of 7.25 , MB fraction of 31 , CK of 283. As noted above ,she will undergo cardiac viability study on 4/30/05 and mayreceive evaluation by the Electrophysiology Service.2. Pulmonary: The patient's initial presentation was suspiciousfor pulmonary embolism given her distant past medical history ofDVT's. However , when she was admitted , she exhibited onlytachycardia without evidence of tachypnea or hypoxia and herclinical course thus far , as well as her PE protocol CT is notsuggestive of this diagnosis. She has had a minimal oxygenrequirement over the course of her hospital stay. She doesexperience dyspnea on exertion , however , has not been hypoxic atany point.3. Endocrine: TSH was normal. The patient was continued on heroral hypoglycemic as well as an adjusted insulin regimen whichwill be further altered prior to the patient's discharge. Inaddition , she will be discharged with a prescription for a newblood glucose monitor. Her last hemoglobin A1c check was closeto 12. Given her concerning findings of coronary artery disease ,she will need to maintain much tighter control of her bloodglucose in the future. At the time of dictation , the patient isbeing maintained on scheduled NPH as well as regular insulinsliding scale.4. Hematologic: Baseline anemia with admission hematocritimproved from prior infectious diseases. The patient'sproductive cough was thought to be not due to infection. Thepatient has remained afebrile with normal white blood cell countover the course of her hospital stay.The remainder of this patient's hospital course and her dischargemedications will be dictated in a future addendum.eScription document: 6-6264555 MCSFocus transcriptionistsDictated By: LLYOD , NORMANAttending: KREITZ , DESHAWNDictation ID 5464489D: 9/15/05T: 9/15/05

Her chest x-ray wasconsistent with congestive heart failure , and she was transferredto Ckmond Kinga Quinaualv Medical Center with the request of her daughterfor further management of her heart failure. Here , her mentalstatus was borderline upon admission , but it improved withdiscontinuation of standing analgesic and decreasing of herclonazepam. A head CT showed no acute processes. She had aright upper arm cellulitis and urinary tract infection onscreening urinalysis. She was anemic. She was found to bevancomycin resistant Enterococcus positive , but repeated culturesdemonstrated MRSA negative. Her inpatient issues includedmanagement of her heart failure , right upper extremitycellulitis , urinary tract infection , chronic anemia , diabetes ,and evaluation of her hip by orthopedics.ALLERGIES: She had allergies to penicillin and codeine , but thereactions are unknown.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Vitamin C , Imuran , PhosLo , ironsulfate , Deltasone , Coumadin , Aranesp , Dilaudid for pain ,lactulose , Reglan , Sarna topical , Senokot , Ambien for sleep ,miconazole powder , cyclosporine , Celexa , and Lasix 80 mg once perday.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile. Her blood pressure was130/57 , and her pulse 120 in sinus tachycardia. She was 95%saturated on 3 liters. Physical exam was significant forbibasilar crackles in her lungs. 2+ edema in her legs to herknees. A 5 cm x 5 cm area of warm erythema in her right upperextremity and a left hip wound with packing in place granulationtissue.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: CT of her head , which showed no acuteprocesses. Echocardiogram of her heart showed an ejectionfraction of 55%. Normal right ventricle and structure with mildto moderately reduced systolic function in her right ventricle.Moderately dilated left atrium , moderately dilated right atrium ,normal aortic valve , mild to moderate mitral regurgitation , andstructurally normal tricuspid valve. Right upper arm ultrasound ,which showed no evidence of venous obstruction.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: Ms. Gockley 's inpatient issuesincluded management of her heart failure , right upper armextremity cellulitis , urinary tract infection , chronic anemia ,diabetes and evaluation of her hip by orthopedics. For her heartfailure , she was diuresed with IV and transitioned to oraltorsemide and they entered discharge dose of torsemide 200 mgp.o. twice per day. Her admission weight was 133 kg and herdischarge weight 122 kg. She should continue on her currenttorsemide and limit her daily salt intake , and restrict herselfto 2 liters per day for her right upper extremity cellulitis.She was given a five-day course of levofloxacin ( used to addressrecurrent UTI ) and then a two-day course of Ancef , her cellulitiscleared with this regimen. For her urinary tract infection , shewas initially treated with levofloxacin and transitioned toBactrim based on antibiogram sensitivities. A long-term Foleycatheter was removed. Repeat cultures showed bacteria in herurine; however , she was clinically asymptomatic , it was felt thatthis is more consistent with colonization and no furthertreatment was instituted. If needed for further antibiotics , aPICC line was placed on May , 2005 , after her prior PICCline clotted. Prior to discharge , a new Foley catheter wasplaced and she was incontinent of urine and overall morecomfortable with catheter in place. While on Bactrim for herUTI , her creatinine rose to a peak of 2.0 , it was unclear whetherthis raise was due to diuresis or the antibiotic. With cessationof the antibiotic , her creatinine trended downward to herbaseline at 1.6. For her chronic anemia , the patient wascontinued on iron ( which was increased to three times per day )and darbepoetin , folate was added. She was asymptomatic from herchronic anemia. She was given two units of packed red bloodcells in May , 2005 , and two more units on February ,2005 , and she responded appropriately to this. Her dischargehematocrit was 30. Her hip was evaluated by orthopedics. Theyfelt her hip was healing well. She should be continued onwet-to-dry dressings. No further orthopedic intervention isplanned. She can bear her full weight on her hip. At discharge ,the patient was hemodynamically stable , afebrile , and breathingcomfortably on three liters of oxygen. She was discharged toNaor Viewmor Hospital and should work aggressively towardsreconditioning.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Vitamin C 500 mg twice per day , Imuran 25mg daily , PhosLo 667 mg three times per day , clonazepam 0.25 mgtwice per day , cyclosporine 50 mg twice daily , Colace 100 mgtwice daily , iron sulfate 325 mg three times per day , folate 1 mgdaily , Dilaudid 2 mg every six hours as needed for pain , pleasehold this sedated for respirations less than 10 per minute ,insulin NPH 14 units every evening , insulin NPH 46 units everymorning , lactulose 30 mL four times per day as needed forconstipation , prednisone 5 mg every morning , Sarna topical everyday apply to affected areas , multivitamin daily , Coumadin 2.5 mgdaily , goal INR 2 to 3 , zinc sulfate 220 mg daily , Ambien 5 mgbefore bed as needed for insomnia , torsemide 200 mg by mouth twotimes per day , Fosamax 70 mg once per week , miconazole nitrate 2%powder topical two times per day apply to affected areas asneeded , Advair Diskus 250/50 one puff inhaled twice per day ,esomeprazole 20 mg once per day , DuoNeb 3/0.5 mg inhaled everysix hours as needed for shortness of breath , Aranesp 50 mcgsubcutaneously once per week , NovoLog sliding scale before meals ,Lexapro 20 mg once per day , Maalox one to two tablets every sixhours as needed for upset stomach , and Lipitor 20 mg once perday.OUTSTANDING ISSUES: Include following INR the goal of 2 to 3 ,following weight and clinical signs of volume overload , followingup on loose stools for possible Clostridium difficile infection.Following clinical signs for evidence of urinary tract infectiontreating with antibiotics as necessary.PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Dr. Rodolfo LoveeScription document: 4-3766097 SSSten TelCC: Hyman Footman M.D.Delp Coscotaence LasNewsbridDictated By: SINOR , ROGERAttending: BRASSEAUX , JOSEPHDictation ID 5980185D: 10/4/05T: 10/4/05

The creatininewas 3.6 on admission up from 1 in 6/29 and up from 2.2 in 6/8BUN was elevated at 96. Labs were also notable for hematocritof 24 down from a baseline of 44 in 2001. The patient reportsbeing told that she had chronic kidney disease during anadmission to SITMH in 7/18 , attributed to heavy NSAID use in thesetting of degenerative joint disease. The patient stopped usingNSAIDs in 6/8 Prior to September , she reports decreased p.o. intakein the setting of feeling like she was retaining fluid. Today ,she complains of diffuse swelling and increased shortness ofbreath x2-3 weeks. Denies chest pain , orthopnea or PND. Also ,reports dysuria in the setting of indwelling Foley since 6/8Denies fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , no melenaor bright red blood per rectum in the last six months but reportsmelena and bright red blood per rectum intermittently in 2003 inthe setting of colonoscopy that was positive for diverticula.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:The patient was afebrile with a heart rate ranging from 60-90 ,systolic blood pressure of 120-140 , respiratory rate of 18 , shewas satting 95% on 2-4 liters. The patient was obese nonmobile ,alert and oriented x3 and in no apparent distress. Pupils wereequal round and reactive to light. Sclerae were anicteric. Shehad no conjunctival pallor. JVP could not be assessed due tobody habitus. She had a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 andS2. She had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur audible at the leftupper sternal border. Lungs were notable for crackles at theleft base on anterior lung exam , they were otherwise clear. Herabdomen was obese , she had positive bowel sound. It was soft ,nondistended and nontender. Extremities were warm and wellperfused. She had 2+ pitting edema to the knee bilaterally.Pertinent lab results as mentioned in the HPI.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES DURING THE ADMISSION:1/13/05 creation of left arm AV fistula; 7/7/05 EGD.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:In summary , this is a 60-year-old morbidly obese woman whopresented with acute and chronic renal failure and anemia.PROBLEM:1. Renal: Renal failure initially thought to be secondary toprerenal etiology in the setting of elevated BUN/creatinine ratioand FENA less than 1% in the setting of Lasix and FEBUN of 19%and because of the presence of abundant granular casts. ATN alsopossibility but urine sodium was 29. Postrenal etiology wasruled out with a renal ultrasound without evidence ofhydronephrosis. The patient was aggressively hydrated onceoutside hospital records confirmed an ejection fraction of 60%.However , the patient initially appeared to fail volume challengewith no acute change in creatinine past 3.2 from 10/18/05 to4/20/05. At that time , Vascular Surgery was consulted for AVfistula placement in the setting of GFR of approximately 17 thatwas not improving. AV fistula was placed on 1/13/05 in the leftarm without complication. Renal function was waxing and waningthroughout hospital course with creatinine at time of dischargeof 3.1. Daily urine output usually approximately 600-700 mL.All diuretics and ACE inhibitor was held throughout hospitalcourse and blood pressure well controlled. The patient shouldnot be restarted on these medications because it will precipitateworsening kidney failure.2. GI: Colonoscopy in 2001/2003 notable for diverticula. Stoolwas guaiac throughout hospital course and generally guaiacpositive brown stool. Hematocrit did not bump appropriatelyafter transfusion of 4 units. It went from 23.3-30. GI wasconsulted in this setting and plans were made for EGD andcolonoscopy to look for a source of GI bleed. Both procedureswere scheduled in OR and attempted on 2/22/05. EGD successfullyperformed with evidence of gastritis , nonbleeding ulcer , andduodenal mass with gastric heterotopia. H. pylori stool antigenand H. pylori biopsies negative. Patient continued on Nexium 40mg daily. Colonoscopy not obtained unable to get past the rectumin the setting of required general anesthesia/ETT in patient'sthighs.3. Cardiovascular/Pump - ECHO with EF equal to 65% here ,moderate diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonaryhypertension. No rhythm or ischemia issues during hospitalcourse , low HDL , started on statin.4. Heme/normocytic anemia , likely secondary to GI bleed withevidence of iron deficiency. Iron stores repleted with IV iron ,also possible anemia in setting of low EPO. EPO level checkedlow and normal , may ultimately benefit from Epogen. On Coumadinfor DVT prophylaxis/paroxysmal a-fib prior to arrival.Supratherapeutic on admission , so Coumadin held in the setting ofGI bleed until INR 1.5 , then patient was covered withsubcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. However , acute drop inplatelets in the setting of heparin from the 200s to the 30s , soheparin stopped. PF4 antibody negative x1 and borderline x1.PF4 antibody pending at the time of discharge , but all heparinproducts including flush is held. The patient restarted onCoumadin after EGD at 12.5 mg a day. Status post three doses ,INR was 2. Target INR is 2-2.5 and the patient will be followedat the Tarbripin Of Anticoagulation Clinic , phonenumber is 915-360-5305. INRs can be faxed to clinic from rehaband adjustments in doses can be made accordingly.5. Endo: TSH within normal limits. Hemoglobin A1c 5.5 , so noevidence of diabetes.6. ID: UTI/proteus , levofloxacin renally dosed. Repeat urinedirty , so p.o. Cipro started for empiric treatment of UTI insetting of indwelling Foley. Two days prior to discharge , thepatient with low-grade temp to max 100.4. Chest x-ray unchangedbut only portable chest x-ray was obtained due to patient'simmobility , blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.Empirically treating for nosocomial pneumonia with p.o.levo/cefpodox/azithro x10 days , PICC line in place at time ofdischarge. However , it should be discontinued by 11/19/05 toprevent infection.7. Allergy: Postnasal drip. Rhinorrhea. Continued Claritinand Flonase.8. Psyche: Zoloft continued for depression.9. Pulmonary: Intermittent , the patient intermittentlydesaturates on room air to 80s but always resolved withrepositioning and O2. Likely secondary to respiratory muscledeconditioning and to restrictive lung disease in the setting ofmorbid obesity. Continuing Flovent for asthma and albuterol nebsp.r.n. for wheezing. Continue CPAP at night for obstructivesleep apnea.10. Oncology: History of breast mass last evaluated in 4/20 atwhich time the risk of surgery would determine to be greater thanthe possible risk of breast cancer. Oncology not able to seepatient during inpatient stay but will schedule outpatientfollowup regarding the issue of possible treatment withtamoxifen.11.

She had one normal bowel movement on the dayof admission. She denied pyuria , anorexia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Graves' disease. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. MEDICATIONS: Onadmission included , 10 mg po b.i.d.; Inderal , 40 mg pob.i.d. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. HABITS: Negativesmoking history. No alcohol intake.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed an ill appearingfemale in moderate distress. Lungs wereclear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac exam revealed a regularrate and rhythm. Abdomen was soft , nondistended , right lowerquadrant and right upper quadrant tenderness , lower greater thanupper , positive bowel sounds , negative Murphy's sign. No shake orperitoneal signs. Rectal exam revealed normal tone , no masses ,nontender , no stool in vault.LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a white blood cellcount of 14.33. Hematocrit 36.3. Urinalysisrevealed 15-20 red cells.PROCEDURES: EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY.APPENDECTOMY.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor. There ,she had a temperature of 102.2 and a pulse of152. She continued to experience right upper and right lowerquadrant pain , lower greater than upper. Because of a knowncholelithiasis , differential of her right sided abdominal painincluded , primarily , cholecystitis and appendicitis. She thusunderwent abdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound revealed right upperquadrant gallbladder with mildly thickened walls , gallstones , butno common duct dilatation or pericholecystic fluid. The rightlower quadrant revealed thickened small bowel walls but peristalsiswas also identifiable. Using the ultrasound probe , the right lowerquadrant was certainly more tender than the right upper quadrant.On serial examinations , her abdominal pain and tenderness becamegradually worse and her temperature continued to remain highspiking to 101 to 102. She was thus brought to the Operating Roomfor an exploratory laparotomy. A paramedian incision was made andappendicitis noted. The gallbladder appeared grossly normal. Shetolerated the procedure well without any complications.Postoperatively , she continued to have high temperature spikingover 103 degrees. She also became tachycardic to approximately150. Because she had not been taking her medications for a fewdays preoperatively as well as because she had tremor ,hyperreflexia , fever , and tachycardia she was suspected to bethyrotoxic. Of note , she had been in atrial fibrillation one monthprior to admission. Endocrinology consult was obtained and basedon their recommendations , she was restarted on , 15 mg po qsix hours; Inderal , 40 mg po q six hours; SSKI , one-third of 1 ccpo t.i.d. Thyroid function tests were sent. She graduallydefervesced. Her heart rate diminished and her ambulation wasrapidly advanced. Her wound was noted to be slightly erythematousand she was thus started on Velosef.DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Percocet , oneto two tablets po q four hours p.r.n.; Inderal , 40 mgpo q six hours; SSKI , one-third cc po t.i.d.; , 10 mg pot.i.d.; Velosef , 500 mg po q.i.d. times seven days.YP679/12 -8RUFUS POULOS , M.D. HY5 D: 7/25/92Batch: 5689 Report: Z4688J04 T: 11/14/92Dictated By: MARLON KUSKY , M.D.

End stage renal disease on chronichemodialysis. 2. Mild mental retardation.3. Movement disorder ( tics ). 4. Status post parathyroidectomy.5. Partial thyroidectomy. 6. Status post partial gastrectomy forpeptic ulcer disease. 7. History of MRSA from wound in 1988.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46-year-oldgentleman with end stage renal diseaseon chronic hemodialysis who was admitted status post fall andseizure. The patient's end stage renal disease is thought to besecondary to hypertension , although he has never had a renalbiopsy. He has been on hemodialysis since 1987 , having dialysisthree times a week. His dry weight is about 85 to 86 kilos. Hisdialysis has been complicated by multiple episodes in the past ofhypotension and seizure activity occurring after dialysis. Theseepisodes occur about once a month.On the day of admission , the patient came home from routinehemodialysis where he was ultrafiltered 5.5 kilograms of fluid andhis final blood pressure after dialysis was 100/60. At noon , thepatient went home , ate lunch and went up to his room. At that timehe complained of feeling dizzy and sitting on the edge of the bedtold his uncle that he was not feeling well and then slumped ontothe floor. He does not believe that he hurt himself , i.e. , did nothurt his head , although he did complain of some right foot pain.He was still conscious as his uncle lifted him back to bed and thenan ambulance was called.After a few minutes , the patient lost consciousness , rolling hiseyes back with some facial twitching bilaterally and tongueretraction. This episode lasted about five minutes. There was notongue biting , no urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence. Thepatient gained full recovery of his alertness upon waking up butwas a bit diaphoretic. His aunt checked his vital signs which wereblood pressure 70/40 , pulse 79. The patient had also complained ofchest pain for a few minutes prior to his episode. When the EMTsarrived , the patient was alert and oriented times three , cold andclammy , temperature 98.6 , pulse 89 , respirations 26 , blood pressure82/60.The patient was brought to the emergency room and was orthostaticby blood pressure ( 10 points ) from lying to sitting. He was given500 ccs of normal saline and was no longer orthostatic , comfortablysitting up in the bed. At about 9:00 p.m. he complained of feelingdizzy and became diaphoretic while trying to stand up. The patientwas again brought into bed. He became unresponsive for one minutewith his eyes rolled up and some bilateral face twitching. Thisepisode only lasted about one minute. The patient was admitted forobservation.Past medical history reveals the following: 1 ) Mild mentalretardation since about 10 years ago. 2 ) Movement disorder ( tics )on Stelazine. 3 ) End stage renal disease thought to be secondaryto hypertension. 4 ) Status post parathyroidectomy for secondaryhyperparathyroidism. 5 ) Partial thyroidectomy for goiterincidentally found at surgery. 6 ) Status post partial gastrectomyfor peptic ulcer disease in the 1960's. 7 ) History of MRSA fromwound in 1988. 8 ) Hepatitis B surface antibody positive andhepatitis C virus positive. Medications on admission: Calciumcarbonate , 1250 mg PO tid; nephrocaps , 1 PO qd; DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd;Stelazine , 2 mg PO tid. There are no known allergies. Socialhistory: The patient was a former smoker and has a history ofalcohol abuse but no IV drug use. He lives with his aunt and uncleand is mildly retarded.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , vital signsshowed a lying blood pressure of 96/60 ,pulse 80 , sitting up blood pressure 104/70 , pulse 96 , temperature97.5 , O2 sat 95% on room air. The patient was a well nourished ,black male in no apparent distress. HEENT exam was unremarkable.Neck showed JVD of 4 cms. No lymphadenopathy. Chest was clear toauscultation. Heart revealed S1 , S2 , normal rate and rhythm with a1/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border.No CVA tenderness. Abdomen was soft , nontender , no masses. Bowelsounds were positive. The patient was guaiac negative with brownstool. Extremities revealed a tender , edematous dorsal aspect ofright foot , with full range of motion at the ankle joint. Leftextremity benign. Neuro exam was grossly nonfocal.LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 142 , potassium 4.8 ,chloride 94 , bicarb 32 , BUN 38 , creatinine 8.6 ,glucose 168. A CBC revealed white count of 8.82 , hematocrit 35 ,platelets 246. Calcium was 9.7. Chest x-ray revealed mildpulmonary vascular redistribution with no significant CHF and noinfiltrates. Ankle x-rays on the right revealed no fracture ordislocation. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 76 ,axis 2 degrees , some 1 mm ST elevations in I and AVL , T-waves flatin lead III. The slight elevations in ST were consistent with EKGon 1/9/94.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was observed overnight and put onan oral renal diet , checking orthostaticsfrequently. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout hishospital course and remained hemodynamically stable with noorthostasis. The patient was evaluated by the renal service whoassessed that this episode was most likely secondary to theextensive fluid removal from dialysis leading to a low bloodpressure. In addition , they noted that seizures and orthostasisare often seen status post dialysis in some patients. Theyrecommended no further work up of this seizure episode andrecommended no prophylaxis with an antiepileptic. The patientunderwent dialysis again on 6/5/94 per schedule. After thisdialysis , the patient was asymptomatic , not orthostatic and did notcomplain of any light headedness.As the patient complained of right foot pain , right foot films wereobtained which revealed nondisplaced fractures of the second ,third , fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Orthopaedic service wasconsulted who put the patient in a bivalve cast with a toe plate.Physical therapy was consulted. The patient was allowed to sit ina chair and engage in nonweight bearing activities. His foot waselevated on three pillows for 72 hours. The patient remainedhemodynamically stable and now awaits placement into a skillednursing facility for rehabilitation , given his casted right lowerleg.DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged on his medicationsfrom admission which include: 1 ) Nephrocaps , 1 POqd. 2 ) Calcium carbonate , 1250 mg PO tid. 3 ) DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd.4 ) Stelazine , 2 mg PO tid.

She was in her usual state of health untilOctober of this year , when she began to experience dyspnea onexertion , shortness of breath one week after her husband died.Initially she thought it was anxiety secondary to her husband'sdeath , but this shortness of breath began to increase and occurredon rest. She also reports that she has had a recent history oforthopnea and says that for the past few months she has hadbilateral lower extremity edema with gradual onset. She also hashad a dry , non productive cough for the past month and three daysago began to have fevers up to 102 , chills , nausea , dry heaves ,headache and diarrhea. The shortness of breath has increased inintensity and yesterday she began to experience sharp pleuriticright chest pain. She denied productive cough , neck stiffness ,photophobia , sick contacts , chest pain , palpitations , or recenttravel. Of note , the patient had been on Plaquenil previously butshe self discontinued this three months ago because she has beenfeeling well. She has had no recurrence of her rheumatoidarthritis symptoms , which for her include arthritis in her hands.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is significant fordiabetes type 2 , hypertension , TTP , historyof splenectomy , history of Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcalsepsis , rheumatoid arthritis with systemic lupus erythematosusfeatures , history of osteomyelitis in the right ankle , history ofovarian cancer in 1989 , status post chemotherapy , total abdominalhysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS: Her medications include diltiazem 240 mg a day ,lisinopril 40 mg a day , Naprosyn 500 mg b.i.d. , NPHinsulin 24 units subcutaneously q.a.m. , Entex-LA.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her son. Her husband recentlydied in October of this year with esophagealcancer. She has no alcohol or tobacco use. She is an elementaryschool teacher.FAMILY HISTORY: Family history is significant for coronary arterydisease as well as breast carcinoma.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient wasafebrile with a temperature of 98 , pulse inthe 100s , blood pressure 182/99. The patient's oxygen saturationwas 92% on 5 liters. She was alert and oriented , in mildrespiratory distress. The skin was without rash. HEENT: Notsignificant. NECK: The neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy orthyromegaly. CARDIOVASCULAR: Tachycardic , regular rhythm , withoutmurmurs , gallops or rubs. She had no jugular venous distention.LUNGS: The lungs revealed markedly decreased breath sounds at thebases and faint crackles at the bases on the right. ABDOMEN:Abdominal examination was completely benign. No hepatomegaly ormasses. She did have a scar from the splenectomy. EXTREMITIES:The extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally. There were no cords.Negative Homans' sign. There was no clubbing or cyanosis.NEUROLOGICAL: The neurological examination was intact.LABORATORY DATA: Significant laboratory studies included asodium of 137 , white blood cell count of 19.5with 2 bands and 86 polys as well as Howell-Jolly bodies.Hematocrit was 38.6 , platelets 495 , 000. CK was 50 , troponin was 0.D-dimer was greater than 1 , 000. Chest x-ray revealed largebilateral pleural effusions , left greater than right. She had a CTscan which was a limited study that showed no evidence of apulmonary embolism. It showed a questionable infiltrate in theright lung versus compressive atelectasis.HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 57-year-old female with adistant history of ovarian cancer and TTP , whowas admitted with likely community acquired pneumonia and bilateralmoderate to large pleural effusions. Initially the patient wasgiven cefuroxime and levofloxacin in the emergency department for apresumed community acquired pneumonia. She also was given Lasixfor diuresis , given there was a question of whether or not she washaving any heart failure. Given her elevated D-dimer , she had aspiral CT scan of the chest which did not reveal any evidence ofpulmonary embolus and also had lower extremity Dopplers which werenegative. However , there was a continuous Doppler wave form on thestudy which raised the suspicion of a more proximal venouscompression. Therefore , she underwent abdominal CT scan , which didnot show any evidence of venous obstruction as well as lymphaticobstruction.1 ) INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient was admitted and treated forwhat was thought to initially be just a community acquiredpneumonia with large effusions , likely peripneumonic in nature.She initially was started on cefuroxime and azithromycin by theGeneral Medicine team. She was pancultured as well as hadLegionella urine antigen sent. Subsequently her Legionella urineantigen became positive and repeat test again revealed that thiswas in fact positive. At that time , levofloxacin was added givenrecommendations from the Infectious Disease Service. She wascontinued on azithromycin; however , cefuroxime was discontinued asthere was no evidence of other etiology of her pneumonia. Sheunderwent thoracentesis late the evening of her admission , whichrevealed a transudate. Cytology was sent on this and was negativeas well as all cultures were negative from this. She underwentmultiple bilateral therapeutic pleuracentesis , given that theeffusions were quite large. Ultrasound revealed multipleloculations on the right side and she had to undergo right sidedultrasound guided thoracentesis to remove fluid. In addition , thepatient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix to help with theeffusions.The patient continued to have a high oxygen requirement throughoutthe hospitalization despite aggressive thoracentesis. However , asshe was diuresed aggressively , her oxygen requirement was down frominitially 5 to 6 liters per nasal cannula. Prior to discharge , shewas off of O2 except that she had desaturations to 86% withambulation. Therefore , she was discharged home with p.r.n. oxygen.She remained afebrile throughout the rest of the hospitalizationand her pulmonary status continued to improve prior to discharge.Other complications during the hospitalization included an elevatedplatelet count up to 800. This was thought likely to be acutephase reactant secondary to infection and fever and this will befollowed as an outpatient. In addition to this , she had anelevated CA-125 level. This was discussed with her GYN oncologistand he felt that this was likely from the effusions , but againshould be followed as an outpatient to make sure that this resolvesas the effusions continue to resolve. Abdominal CT scan , which wasdone to rule out more proximal venous compression did not revealany recurrence of ovarian cancer.The patient was discharged to home on October , 2000 , with servicesas well as p.r.n. oxygen. She was in stable condition. She had noproblems with her diabetes , hypertension , rheumatoid arthritisthroughout the rest of her hospitalization.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications include Lasix80 mg b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale ,lisinopril 40 mg a day , levofloxacin 500 mg times 14 days ,Cardizem-CD 240 mg p.o. q.d.FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with Dr. Michalek in one week andshe is to have her platelets checked as well as aCA-125 as her Legionella pneumonia resolves.Dictated By: ANDREA MADRUENO , M.D. GY00Attending: CORDELL D.

ALLERGIES:To Penicillin and sulfa drugs , the results of which were not clear.Also , aspirin caused epistaxis in the past. FAMILY AND SOCIALHISTORY: She lives by herself. She works as a lawyer and professorof law. She noted that her family history is positive for adultonset diabetes mellitus in her mother and her grandmother as wellas a family history of hypertension. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Revealedmetromenorrhagia and increased menstrual flow recently. She alsonoted she had decreased her exercise recently.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination her vital signs wereas follows: Temperature 99.7 , heart rate of127 , blood pressure and respiratory rate normal. She was apleasant , young , black female frequently vomiting. HEENT: Notablefor normal examination. Neck supple. There was brisk carotidupstrokes , no thyromegaly was noted. Lungs were clear toauscultation and percussion. Heart was tachycardic. S1 and S2with a holosystolic murmur heard at the apex radiating to the leftsternal border. There was an early decrescendo diastolic murmur atthe base in the aortic area , the lateral resolved with fluids.Abdomen was tender in the epigastrium , it was very tender in thesuprapubic area. Extremities were without edema , cord cyanosis orerythema. Neurological examination was within normal limits onmodalities.LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 105 ,bicarbonate 14 , BUN of 12 , creatinine 0.6 ,glucose 290. White blood cell count 10.6 , platelets 255 ,hematocrit 36.1 with a mean corpuscular volume 85.5. Coags werenormal. Arterial blood gas pH 7.24 , pO2 102 , pCO2 of 27 ,bicarbonate 12. She was acid test positive. Her chest x-rayshowed questionably large pulmonary arteries bilaterally. Therewas no infiltrate or effusion noted. KUB noted a large bladder.There was no bowel gas , we could not rule out ascites. EKG wasnotable for sinus tachycardia at 122 , intervals were 0.15 , 0.088and 0.47.HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Buffey was admitted with a diagnosis ofdiabetic ketoacidosis. She was started onintravenous fluids of D5 normal saline with 40 mEq of potassium perliter. She also received and insulin drip intravenously. She hadher finger stick blood glucoses checked every 2 hours. She alsohad her blood electrolytes and acid tests checked frequently.Given the fact that she was febrile and had presented withacidosis , had a harsh cardiac murmur , she had blood cultures times3 drawn. There were no obvious sources of infection.Regarding her GI bleed , she began to cough up coffee ground emesisafter repeated episodes of wretching throughout the day. Thebleeding was thought to be due to a Mallory-Weiss tear due to theexcessive vomiting. The patient had an NG tube placed for lavagewhich quickly lavaged clear after approximately 1 liter of diluant.A nasal gastric tube was put to Gomco low suction. Additionally ,the patient had intravenous fluids running and her orthostatics andhematocrit were checked frequently. She was started on H2 blockersintravenously and a GI consultation was obtained.Regarding the diabetic ketoacidosis , the patient obtainedconsultation from the Endocrine Division. With intravenous fluidsand insulin drip her ketoacidosis resolved. The endocrinologistsuggested the ultimate regimen of insulin which will be describedbelow. Notably , the patient indicated that she could not reliablytime the midday lunch schedule. Therefore , the patient was givensome flexibility in terms of dosing of insulin at that hour.Regarding her cardiac workup , the patient was noted to have a loudsystolic murmur. She was evaluated by the Dell Hospitalwho recommended echocardiography. The results of theechocardiogram were as described below. The echocardiogram wasobtained on 2 of July , the results were as follows: The left atriumwas mildly dilated. The tricuspid valve leaflet excursion wasmildly increased with tricuspid regurgitation measured as 2+ out of4+ with a peak velocity of 2.5. It was thought that she had amildly dilated right atrium and a mildly concentric hypertrophiedleft ventricle. Mitral regurgitation was 3+ out of 4+. Leftventricular wall thickness was upper limits of normal withpreserved left ventricular systolic function ejection fraction of65 percent. The patient abnormalities of her atrial ventricularcanal noted consistent with ostium primum. Her left and rightatrial ventricular grooves inserted at the same level of theintraventricular septum. There was some evidence of flow reversalin the pulmonary veins as well as the mitral regurgitation notedabove. There was a high flow velocity jet seen in the paramembraneof intraventricular septum , moving from left to right , consistentwith residual ventricular septal defect. There was no atrialseptal defect seen status post surgical repair. There was a smallechocardiogram bright density at the left ventricular site of theparamembranous septum thought to be an anomalous cord attachmentfrom the mitral valve versus endocarditis.On January , the patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogramto evaluate this abnormality seen above. There was no evidence ofresidual atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect. Therewas an anomalous chordal attachment to the base of the interiorleaflet of the mitral valve and no endocarditis vegetations wereseen.The patient was noted to have hypertension and was started onLisinopril , nifedipine was transiently given but was discontinued.The patient was discharged in satisfactory condition on October ,1994. There were no complications of the hospitalization.Operations and procedures of the hospitalization were an esophagealgastroduodenoscopy by Dr. Cornea on July , 1994.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patientwas on Lisinopril 20 mg po q day; insulin12 units plus a regular scale qam before breakfast , insulin 8 unitsplus the scale of regular insulin q noon before lunch , insulin 8units of regular plus a scale of regular qpm before supper , insulinNPH 15 units subcutaneous qhs. The scale of regular insulin was asfollows: Less than 80 , drink orange juice; greater than 80 , 1 unit;greater than the 120 , 2 units; greater than the 160 , 3 units;greater than 200 , 4 units; greater than 500 , 5 units; greater than300 , notify medical doctor.FOLLOW UP CARE: The patient was to follow-up with the followingphysicians: Dr. Harlan Flair at the Varutldale Memorial Hospital , also Dr. William Fanizza in the Woou Land Health and Dr. Dobles in the EndocrinologyClinic.

Previously the patient has beenstable with her SLE but had started Plaquenil recently. On9/28/99 she presented to her rheumatologist complaining ofintermittent leg swelling for the past year and was found to haveleft superficial femoral and gastrocnemius DVT. She was about tobegin Lovenox when she mentioned that she had also experiencedoccasional pleuritic chest pain over the last five years. She then had a V/Qscan which was read as intermediate probability for PE. For definitivediagnosis , a pulmonary angiogram was done on 2/28/99 showing bilateral apicalsmall pulmonary emboli.She was treated with IV heparin and was started onCoumadin to a therapeutic INR of 2.0. She also had an unremarkableechocardiogram at that time. On 2/30/99 , the patient returnedwith increasing wheezing and shortness of breath. Her INR was 1.8.Work up revealed an intermediate probability right-sided V/Qmismatch with a probable new PE. Repeat echocardiogram showed no rightheart strain. It was thought that she had had a recurrent PE inthe setting of subtherapeutic INR. LE DVT was stable on the LENIs.She was discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin to obtain a goal INR of3.0. Unfortunately , two days prior to admission , the patient againnoted increased dyspnea on exertion. She has otherwise beenactive , feeling well over the past week. She denies chest pain ,leg pain , wheezing. V/Q scan performed on the morning of admissionshowed new mismatched lesions at the left posterior base and rightanterior base.

She also received intravenous dihydroergotaminefor migraine headaches with good effect by the following morning.The following morning , the patient received 2 units of FFP becauseher INR was 3.0. The decision to place a filter was postponed andinstead a pulmonary angiogram was performed. This revealed noobvious recurrent pulmonary embolism. The morningof 10/27/99 , prior to the angiogram , twoevents occurred. First event , the patient was walking to thebathroom and her heart rate was noted to go at 140 beats per minuteand was approximately sinus tachycardia or supraventriculartachycardia. This resolved after 45 seconds without interventionand did not recur and there were no associated symptoms and thepatient was unaware of the event.

She underwent a right transmetatarsal amputation in1990 and subsequently underwent a right femorla distal saphenousvein bypass graft in 1991 which was later revised in 1992. Sheseems to be doing well with the left side until September of this year ,at which time she underwent a left superficial femoral artery toanterior tibial artery bypass using non-reversed basilic veinharvested from the right arm. She , however , had a large great toeulcer , possibly attributed to hammertoe , which subsequentlyunderwent a left great toe amputation performed on the 16 of November . After this time , she was discharged to the Nut Hospital inAmore Pu , where she was making progress in physical therapy andrehabilitation. On the day prior to admission , she was exercisingwith 4 pound weights on her legs with the physical therapist whenshe described a cool sensation in her foot. She reported that herfoot had been blue , and there were no Dopplerable pulses. Colorlater returned. The absence of pulses persisted over the course ofthe night , after which point she was referred back to Largrine Medical Center for evaluation. She denies any significant painor any other complications.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for history of insulin-dependentdiabetes , history of coronary arterydisease , history of hypertension , cataracts , MRSA from her toewound on the 3 of March .PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for the above , as well asdebridements of her toe amputation woundsite.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , insulin Lente 12units subcu q p.m. supplemented by slidingscale regular insulin scale , Isordil 30 mg t.i.d. , Zestril 5 mg qd , Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg b.i.d. , Ofloxacin 200 mgp.o. q 12 , Ecotrin 225 mg q d , Vancomycin 1250 mg q 24.

Her right lower extremity was characterized by awell-healed transmetatarsal amputation site. The foot was warm andpink. The left side , however , was cool in comparison , althoughremained pink with adequate capillary refill. Both femoral pulseswere easily palpable , as well as dorsal pedal pulse on the right.Her right posterior tibial pulse was additionally biphasic byDoppler. On the left , she had a biphasic Doppler graft pulse anddorsopedal , although she had no identifiable posterior tibialpulse. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.Admission labs were likewise unremarkable.HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Bulger was admitted and placed on intravenousHeparin until the following morning , at whichtime she proceeded to the Angiography Suite.

The patient presents with a twoto three month history of exertional angina while climbing a hillor rushing on a flat surface. He also admits to symptoms ofshortness of breath , light headedness , and diaphoresis. He deniesany nausea , vomiting , or palpitations. He was seen by Dr. Jean Buchinsky who did an exercise tolerance test. The patient exercisedfor 3 minutes and 40 seconds on a modified Bruce protocol with aheart rate of 99 , which is 70% predicted , a blood pressure of 190over palp and the test was stopped secondary to typical substernalchest pressure. An electrocardiogram revealed a 1 millimeters STdepression in V3 through V5 , and 2:1 second degree AV block. Thepatient had catheterization , which revealed a left mainarteriostenosis of 70% , a circumflex coronary artery with an 80-90%proximal stenosis , a left anterior descending proximal stenosis of70% , and mid 70% right coronary artery occlusion midway. He hadright iliac tortuous stenosis. He also had intraaortic balloonpump placed and went straight to the operating room.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus , irritable bowelsyndrome secondary to a colectomy for colitis , splenomegaly.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for an appendectomy andcholecystectomy , and as mentioned above ,colectomy.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Unremarkable.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was brought to the operating room onJuly , 1998 , where he went a coronary arterybypass graft times three with left internal mammary artery to theleft anterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graft to theobtuse marginal artery , and a saphenous vein graft to the rightcoronary artery. The patient did well , came off bypass withoutincident , with his right intraaortic balloon pump in place andwas brought up to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition. Thepatient was extubated on postoperative day 1. The intraaorticballoon pump was weaned on postoperative day 2 and Mr. Shopbellwent into atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 2 with acontrolled rate.

New stroke , right sided weakness and confusion.OTHER DIAGNOSES:2. Myasthenia gravis.3. Osteoarthritis.4. Pernicious anemia.5. Hypertension , degenerative joint disease.CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right sided weakness and confusion.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Benny is an 83 year old womanwith a history of myasthenia gravis ,arthritis , pernicious anemia and hypertension and degenerativejoint disease with nerve impinging resulting in decreased reflexesin the left lower extremity. She was in her usual state of healthuntil when she woke to go to the bathroom at approximately 2 a.m.on the day of admission. She had difficulty getting up from thesofa where she sleeps and slipped and fell to her knees. Becauseshe stated , "her right leg was weak". She started speaking andtalking loudly. Her son heard her , came up to help her. At thetime he arrived , she was crawling around on her hands and knees andappeared to be mildly confused. He helped her up and assisted herto the bathroom. She was able to walk with assistance and returnedto bed and did not feel like she needed to call a physician at thattime. She then awoke at approximately six in the morning and wasable to walk without assistance to wash her face and then to eatbreakfast. However , at breakfast , the son noted that she was usingher right hand clumsily cutting pieces of banana onto the floor ,not adequately reaching her mouth to feed herself and had begun touse her knife to eat her cereal. He discussed the problem withher. She agreed that she probably needed to call a doctor aboutthis. She attempted to get out of the chair and again slippedforward because of right leg weakness. She contacted her physicianwho recommended that she be seen at the Troitcape Medical CenterWhen seen there , when leaving , her son noted that she seemed to runinto things on her right side. With entering the car , did not pickup her right leg well. At the scboth community hospital , she was found tohave significant right hand weakness and proximal right legweakness. She was sent to the Ist Oska Rutl Memorial Health for further evaluation.She denies having had any previous neurologic events similar tothis episode. She has had an episode of dizziness , nausea andvomiting associated with a severe right occipital headache back in8/5 at which time she was evaluated at the Hosch Reathertage Supro Grahot Clinic and was givendiagnosis of benign positional vertigo which since resolved. Atthat time , she had a CT scan which showed only periventricularwhite matter disease as well as an increased soft tissue density inthe region of the sella. An LP at that time revealed no whitecells and red cells which cleared with successive tubes. She alsosix months ago was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. At that time ,she had the following symptoms: She had difficulty keeping herneck up , difficulty swallowing , her eyelids were drooping. Thesesymptoms resolved quickly with Tensalon injection. She has beensince started on Mestinon and Prednisone with good relief and isfollowed by Dr. Kaushiva at Ci Hospital for this problemand was initially diagnosed by Dr. Gerbatz at Lametizens Health Services .With regards to her current episode , she denies having anysymptoms of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting andpalpitations. She has not had any febrile illness , nausea orvomiting recently. She has not had any episodes of a shade comingdown before her eyes.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Myasthenia gravis diagnosed byDr. Wilson Pozos at Hermum Medical Centerapproximately six months ago. Symptoms as described above , goodrelief with Mestinon and Prednisone. 2. Pernicious anemia ,intrinsic factor antibody positive , receives monthly B12injections. 3. Spine degenerative joint disease , LS spine CT in1/11 showed most marked deterioration at the L4-L5 vertebra withspondylolisthesis , bilateral foraminal narrowing and moderatespinal stenosis. She has long standing decreased reflexes in herleft leg and some decreased sensation to light touch in her leftfoot. 4. Hypertension , has taken Reserpine intermittently over thelast 25 years. She has tolerated this well apparently. This is anoutmoded medication however because she has been on it so long , ithas not been discontinued. However , she has been noted to sufferfrom some mild depression. 5. Osteoarthritis affecting mostly thehands and feet followed by Dr. Hiram Rodrigus at Toncamp Hospital 6. Long standing difficulty sleeping , takesPhenobarbital 15 mg at night prn for this problem for the last 30years 7. Frequent UTI's. 8. Episode of benign positional vertigo ,8/5 as described above. 9. Status post hysterectomy , status postovariectomy. 10. Some difficulty with rightward gaze and upwardgaze of the right eye noted as long back as 4/7 11. Hemorrhoids.12. Right kidney 15 mm simple cyst noted incidentally on theabdominal CT.MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Prednisone 12.5 mg q.o.d. , Daypro 600 mgq day ( arthritis medication ) , Mestinon 60mg p.o. q.i.d. , Reserpine 0.25 mg q day and Phenobarbital 15 mg to30 mg q h.s. ( for sleep ).FAMILY HISTORY: Father and two brothers died in World War II.Mother died of a lung problem.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient worked as a lab assistant in theCo Minbalt for preventative medicineand later in pathology. She has been retired since 1968 , currentlyvolunteers at Pua Medical Center in the gift shop on Tuesdayafternoon. She lives with her husband and one son at home.EXAM: The patient is an elderly appearing woman with a livelyvoice and no apparent distress. She gestures much morewith her left hand compared to her right hand. Vital signs: Temp97.8 , pulse 84 , blood pressure 110/80 , respirations 18. Generalexam: HEENT normocephalic atraumatic. Left palpebral fissure isslightly smaller than right. Throat without erythema. Neck: Goodrange of motion. Chest: Faint end-expiratory wheezes , smallcrackles at the right base. Coronary: Regular rate and rhythm ,possible faint systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border , nocarotid bruits. Abdomen: Soft and nontender. Extremities: Jointdeformities most notable in the hands and feet. Joint deformitiesin the hands include the distal interphalangeal joints which isnonconsistent with rheumatoid arthritis , ulnar deviation of thehand is present. Neuro exam: Mental status alert , oriented toApril , 1995 at *teet Memorial Hospital , Clinton/Gore ,cannot remember the previous president , picks Reagan. Language:Fluent and nondysarthric , good repetition , reading andcomprehension , poor word generation but is better in term thanattention. Patient can span five forward , backwards and missesrely and tune , possibly mild decreased attention. Memory: Fairfor events leading to hospitalization but some difficulty gettinglogical sequence of occurrences , may partly be due to languagedifficulties. Visual spacial: Clock shows poor organization ,writes numbers down the middle of the circle. Cranial nerves II:Right pupil is slightly larger than left pupil , reactive , visualfields full to confrontation , 3 , 4 , 6 , possible decreased abductionand vertical upgaze of the right eye. However , she denies doublevision. VII: Smiles symmetrically. Eyebrows symmetric. There ispossibly decreased left nasolabial fold on the left , however , smileis symmetric. VIII: Hearing intact , finger rubbing bilaterally.IX , X: Palate is up bilaterally. Turgor of the mouth is 5/5.Tongue midline. Motor: No drifts , difficulty with fine fingermovement on the right side which is slightly slower than on theleft , has especially more difficulty on the right side initiatingthe movements figuring out what to do. Right rapid alternatingmovements of the right hand is slightly slower than the left.Power: Deltoid , biceps and triceps 5/5 , bilaterally symmetric ,however does not raise her right deltoid as high. Wrist extensorson the right are 4+/5 and on the left 5/5. Interossei on the right5-/5 , on the left 5/5. Lower extremities: Iliopsoas , quads , hamsand gastrocs all 5/5 symmetric. EHL possibly slightly diminishedstrength on the right. Has increased difficulty with heel to shinon the right leg probably suggestive of proximal right lowerextremity weakness not apparent on cognition testing. Sensoriesand light touch and pinprick are grossly intact throughout. Nodouble simultaneously stimulation extension , proprioception intactin the feet bilaterally. Decreased vibration in the left footcompared to the right foot , reflexes upper extremities 2+symmetric , lower extremities - right lower extremity 3+ knee , 2+ankle. Toes downgoing , left , 1+ knee , 1+ ankle , toe downgoing.Coordination: Finger to nose within normal limits bilaterally.Heel to shin slightly worse on the right lower extremity , possiblysecondary to proximal flexor weakness. Gait: Walks quickly butrequires holding onto assistants for balance. Incidentally , shesays it is because she needs shoes for arthritis , marked pronationof the ankle on small steps.LABS: Sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 106 , C02 25 , BUN 15and creatinine 0.9 , glucose 125 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium2.0 , B12 was normal. RPR nonreactive. PFT's normal. Phenobarblevel not detected. Tox screen positive for Benzodiazepine ( thismay have been due to sedation she received for the CT. However , itis not clear that she received sedation ). Hematocrit 34.6 with MCVof 80.6 , platelets 217 , white count 9.05 , polys 73 , 18 lymphs , 7monos , 2 eo and 7 basophils. PT 13.1 , PTT 25.7. CT:Periventricular white matter disease , slightly increased densityabove the sella.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is an elderly woman with hypertension ,myasthenia gravis and arthritis who presentedwith weakness of her right lower extremity and right hand and someconfusion as evidenced by using a knife to eat her cereal insteadof a spoon. Her exam was notable for mildly impaired attention ,possibly confused clock difficulty with handwriting and decreasedstrength of the right hand and likely probably decreased strengthto the right lower extremity. Hip flexors is based on the relativedifficulty with heel to shin on the right. Old findings on examincluded abnormalities of the right eye muscles , decreased leftpalpebral fissure and sensory findings in the left lowerextremities as well as reflexes. Her presentation was consistentwith possible small vessel stroke affecting the arm and leg morethan the face. This could have occurred in the pons area or theinternal capsule. The component of confusion however is lessexplainable based on a deep lesion such as this and raised thepossibility of a small cortical insult. MRI showed no territorialstroke , just T2 intense abnormalities in the periventricular whitematter , corona radiata and centrum semiovalle suggestive of smallvessel disease. Echo and Holter were not suggestive ofcardioembolic disease. Echo showed normal LV size , preserved LVfunction with estimated ejection fraction of 80%. There is alsomild LVH , no thrombus was seen. There was aortic sclerosis withmildly regurgitation , mild thickening of the mitral valve leafletswith mild mitral regurgitation and bubble study was negative.Holter was sinus rhythm at 54 to 127 beats per minute. Occasionalfrequent APB's , 14 atrial couplets , five runs of SVT ranging from 3to 10 beats with heart rates 108 to 182 , occasionally only frequentVPB's at all hours and one ventricular couplet. Carotidnoninvasive studies showed no significant hemodynamic lesions. Ofnote on the MRI , the basilar artery appeared to be small caliberand the carotid showed some calcification. On carotid noninvasivestudies , however , there was only minimal plaque in the carotidarteries.In summary , it appears that Ms. Epperly had a small vessel stroke.She showed some critical improvement during hospital stay and wasable to walk without assistance on the second hospital day. Shealso had improved right hand function and appeared to be lessconfused. We recommended starting enteric coated aspirin which sheis to take one per day. In the setting of the acute stroke , we didnot control her blood pressure aggressively. Her pressures rangedfrom systolics of 120 to 180 averaging around 140 to 150 withdiastolics usually in the 80's. We have suggested that shediscontinue the use of her Reserpine as intermittent use isproblematic especially with this medication and she admits tointermittent use as well as the fact that she has suffered fromsome mild depression that can be associated with Reserpine. Shewill be started on an alternative blood pressure as an out-patientwith Dr. Scotton in the next week. We did not wish to start thismedication in the acute setting. She will likely be started on anAce inhibitor for blood pressure control. We also suggested thatshe discontinue the use of Phenobarbital for sleep as this mightcontribute to confusion.Finally , since she is on Prednisone and Mestinon , we asked thepatient whether she was taking GI prophylaxis. Evidently , she onlydoes this intermittently as well. She may be on Carefate , however ,we suggested taking an H2 blocker once in the evening and haveprovided her with the prescription for Zantac 150 mg q h.s. Shewill follow-up with Dr. Milosch , her primary doctor at Ni Health as well as Dr. Salmen at the Ont Hospitalfor her myasthenia gravis and stroke. She has an appointment withDr. Zurovec next week on Wednesday.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q day.2. Prednisone 12.5 mg p.o. q.o.d.3. Mestinon 60 mg p.o. q.i.d.4.

The patient had also previously beenbegun on amiodarone for chemical cardioversion , however , hedeveloped severe hyperthyroidism. The patient also has had severalrecent admissions for exacerbations of his congestive heartfailure , most recently in February , 1998 when he was admitted fortailored therapy. At that time , an echocardiogram demonstrated anejection fraction of , approximately , 20 percent with atrialdimension of 5 centimeters , left ventricular diastolic dimension of7.7 centimeters , moderate-severe mitral regurgitation , and moderatetricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary artery pressure ofapproximately 40 , plus right atrial pressure. The patient was , atthat time , diuresed to his dry weight , which is approximately 186pounds. Unfortunately , he was again admitted in February of 1998with volume overload and was diuresed. At that time , he was notedto be in atrial fibrillation , and was cardioverted on hispreviously implanted AICD.His most recent admission was on May to March , whenhe again was cardioverted by his AICD for atrial fibrillation andtreated for volume overload. In October of 1999 , he had increasingfiring of his AICD both for true ventricular tachycardia , as wellas for atrial fibrillation , and anti-tachycardia pacing. He wasseen in cardiomyopathy clinic on July , and was found to be inatrial fibrillation and volume overloaded. His diuretics wereincreased at that time , as his weight was 207 pounds , and hediuresed down to a weight of 199 pounds. It was felt thatamiodarone would be the best drug for him in terms of management ofhis ventricular and atrial arrhythmias , and so the patientunderwent an elective thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine. Hereceived 30 mCi of I-131. He now presents today after the thyroidablation for amiodarone load and cardioversion. The patient isfeeling relatively well , and is not experiencing any significantdyspnea on exertion or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He reports noincreased lower extremity edema. No neck pain. No fever orchills. No nausea or vomiting.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Notable for dilated cardiomyopathydiagnosed in 1992. His most recent V.02 is19.5 in February of 1995.

VITAL SIGNS: The patient was afebrile. Pulse was100 to 120. Blood pressure was 90/75. LUNGS: Clear toauscultation. CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart rate which is regular ,irregular with S1 and S2 normal , and intermittent S3 , and a II/VIholosystolic murmur best auscultated at the apex radiating to thisaxilla. ABDOMEN: His belly was soft , nontender , nondistended withactive bowel sounds and a palpable liver , approximately , 1.5centimeters below the costal margin , which was pulsatile.EXTREMITIES: His extremities were warm and well perfused. DistalPulses were 2+. There was no edema.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: BUN of 58. Creatinine of 2.5.Potassium of 3.8. INR of 5.1.Hematocrit of 42.8. White count of 8.5.DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: His electrocardiogram was notable for atrialfibrillation of , approximately , 120 with azero degree axis and an intraventricular conduction delay; R-waveprogression was poor. He had ST-T wave changes consistent withdigitalis effect. There was no change in this cardiogram comparedto the one in February of 1998.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the CardiologyService , and an amiodarone load was initiated at400 milligrams four times a day. Endocrinologist Service wasconsulted and followed along status post his ablation. The patientwas felt to be euvolemic and slightly hypovolemic upon hisadmission , and his diuretics were reduced to 100 twice a day ofTorsemide. After approximately 36 hours with a slightliberalization of his fluid intake , the patient normalized , and hebecame slight hypervolemic. At that time , his diuretic regimen wasreturned to his normal outpatient dose of 200 twice a day , and hereceived an extra dose of intravenous Torsemide. On the third ofhospitalization , March , 1999 , the patient was cardioverted byhis ICD with 30 joules of synchronous shock , which turned thepatient to sinus rhythm. At this point , he had received three daysof amiodarone at 400 milligrams four times a day. During thisamiodarone load , the patient became markedly nauseated withepisodes of vomiting. It was also noted that he developed somedecreased blood pressure while on the amiodarone attributed to thenegative inotropic effects of the drug. His normal medicationswere intermittently held for hypertension , and the patient , attimes , appeared to be quite unwell during his amiodarone load ,feeling nauseated and relatively hypertensive. However , after thepatient's medicines were given , he returned to a normal bloodpressure and felt well.The patient was successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm onMarch . He will be discharged on amiodarone dose formaintenance now that his load has been completed. His thyroidfunction tests were checked in house subsequent to his ablation ,and they were notable for a T4 level of 9.6. He is to have histhyroid function tests rechecked in , approximately , three weeks andhe will be followed in the endocrine clinic as well at that time.He also is to initiate therapy with Tapazole 10 milligrams a day toprotect the patient from developing hyperthyroidism in the settingof his amiodarone. The patient's dose of Coumadin was also held inhouse as his INR was elevated. It had fallen to a level of 3.0 onthe day of discharge , and he was discharged on a lower dose ofCoumadin to be adjusted as an outpatient by the anticoagulationteam.The patient's renal function returned to baseline , approximately ,24 hours after admission when he returned to a euvolemic state.His slightly elevated creatinine was attributed to pre-renaldehydration. His creatinine on the day of discharge was 1.6 , andhis baseline is , approximately , 1.6 to 2.0. His baselineinsufficiency can be attributed to poor forward flow.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Captopril 75 milligrams q.i.d.( 2 ) Digoxin 0.125 milligrams q.d.( 3 ) Isordil 40 milligrams t.i.d. ( 4 ) Amiodarone 200 milligramsb.i.d. ( 5 ) Torsemide 200 milligrams b.i.d. ( 6 ) Prilosec 20milligrams bid ( 7 ) Tapazole 10 milligrams q.d. to begin on Monday.( 8 ) K-Dur as per his outpatient medicines. ( 9 ) Coumadin3 milligrams q.d. to be adjusted as an outpatient.FOLLOW UP: The patient will return to the Mowe Memorial HospitalHospital early next week to have his electrolytes andINR checked. He will return in , approximately , three weeks tohave thyroid function tests checked , as previously stated. He hasfollow up appointments in both cardiomyopathy clinic and endocrineclinic , and close follow up with the cardiomyopathy and transplantteam.Dictated By: ROLAND JONAH , M.D. AI86Attending: GROVER L.

She has three brothers who have ahistory of obesity , one brother died during cardiac surgery , andshe has two sisters with gallbladder and kidney disease.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient presented as apleasant black female in no apparentdistress. Her blood pressure was 160/96 and she was notorthostatic. Her pulse was 92 , her respiratory rate was 14 , andshe was afebrile. LUNGS: Examination was clear without wheezes orrales. CARDIAC: Examination revealed a regular rate and rhythmwith no murmurs. ABDOMEN: Examination was unremarkable.EXTREMITIES: Revealed 2+ edema to the mid calves and 2+ pulsespalpable. RECTAL: Examination was hemoccult negative.NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was non-focal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient's potassium was2.7 , chloride 92 , CO2 33 , and hermagnesium was 1.6. Her white count was 10 , hematocrit 36.4 , andplatelet count was 313. The patient's liver function tests werewithin normal limits and her chest X-Ray showed no active disease.EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 96 beats per minute , leftventricular hypertrophy with strained pattern , and a Q wave in IIIas well as flipped T waves in V3 through V6. This was no changefrom an EKG in October 1992. The left ventricular hypertrophy wasnew since an EKG in February 1987.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient had an Endocrine consultation to workher up for aldosteronemia. The patient had a24-hour urine which showed no evidence of potassium wastingbringing some doubt on the hyperaldosterone diagnosis. Thepatient's diabetes was well controlled on the basis of fingerstix.The patient's hypertension was controlled by manipulating hermedications. Thyroid work-up revealed a TCH of 2.9 which waswithin normal limits. Her electrolytes were managed with potassiumand magnesium replacement as needed. Her cardiac status wasevaluated as the patient occasionally complained of flutteringfeelings which did not correlate with EKG changes or congestiveheart failure. The patient had an exercise thallium test prior todischarge which was stopped secondary to fatigue and shortness ofbreath. There was no chest pain or EKG changes. The plan was forthe patient to have the patient have a Holter as an out-patient.She is also to have pulmonary function tests as an out-patient.The Endocrine Service will follow-up on the possible diagnosis ofhyperaldosteronemia.

She wasadmitted to the Crotamp Hospital for severe respiratorydistress on 7/10 The summary of clinical events is as follows.The evening of 7/11 , the patient was having intercourse and"collapsed." She was very short of breath with this , and presentedto the Emergency Department via the paramedics. They attempted tointubate her on the field and found her pulse oxygen to be about 60percent on bag valve mask. They were unable to do so. She wasdescribed during this episode by her husband as to have been"gurgling." She began to describe shortness of breath , and tookher inhalers which did not help. She began to cough quite a bitand coughed up some frothy white sputum. At the EmergencyDepartment , she was immediately intubated at SiroseThere was some difficulty intubating her , and she was ultimatelyintubated by the attending anesthesiologist there. Anechocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25 to 30 percent withflat CKs. She was diuresed six liters with a stable BUN andcreatinine and was extubated on 10/11 A right heartcatheterization there showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 40/15 ,wedge of 12 , cardiac output of 5.2. Hemodymanics in the IntensiveCare Unit at Chebanks Hospital indicate the patient's cardiac outputwas quite dependent on her SVR. Her cardiac index fell into thehigh two's when her SVR was in the 1340 range , but jumped up intothe high three's at about 3.8 when her SVR was much lower down inthe 800s. At the outside hospital , a right upper lobe infiltratewas also noted and she was given gentamicin 250 mg times one , andclindamycin 600 mg. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and treatedwith clindamycin , this caused resolution of her white count at theoutside hospital. She also had an increase in her Lasix andlisinopril dose there , as well as her amiodarone. She was startedon Solu-Medrol 40 mg intravenous q.6 hours for possible asthma.She did quite well after her treatment for pneumonia and treatmentfor pulmonary edema , and was transferred to the Misutch University Hospital for further management.Her last admission was on 2/7 to the Ceter Medical Centerfor atypical chest pain , when she had a nondiagnostic exercisetolerance test. She went 6 minutes and 19 seconds with a maximumheart rate of 94. Her chest pain then was ultimately attributed toa gastrointestinal cause.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post inferiormyocardial infarction on 4/27 She was lastadmitted , as noted above , on 2/7 to the Lordchild Hospital for atypicalchest pain. The patient has sick sinus syndrome and is status postdual chamber pacemaker in 6/19 Diabetes mellitus. Hypertension.Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , well-controlled in the past onamiodarone. Past rhythm monitoring has revealed brief runs ofventricular tachycardia. Negative breast biopsy in 3/13MEDICATIONS: Home medications include amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Prempro 0.625/2.5 p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,Coumadin , nitroglycerin sublingual , Zantac , beclomethasone , andVentolin.Medications on transfer , Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 p.o.q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , clindamycin 600 intravenousq.8 , digoxin 0.25 , Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. , Zantac , Albuterol ,Flovent , Solu-Medrol , and amiodarone 300 mg once a day.ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to penicillin.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a ten pack year smoking historyand quit in 1968. No intravenous drug use. Sheis retired from Medical Records at SGH . She has three grownchildren and she is married.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission issignificant for a blood pressure of 114/93 ,this is down from a very high blood pressure on admission at theoutside hospital which was in the 200s. Pulse is 60 , temperatureis 96.5 , saturating 97 percent on two liters. General , this is anagitated woman in no acute distress. Her neck veins were about 5.0to 6.0 cm of water. The lung examination showed a few crackles inthe left base with the right one clear. Cardiovascular examinationrevealed a split S1 and normal S2 , also a soft S3 , the presence ofa 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal borderwas noted. The abdomen was benign , no hepatosplenomegaly noted.The extremities showed no edema , with intact distal pulses.Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented times three withno focal deficits , but careful neurologic examination wasimpossible due to severe agitation and anxiety.LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory on admission was significant for aTroponin of 0.02 , CK of 80 , INR of 1.3 ,hematocrit of 38.0 , BUN/creatinine of 24/0.6.HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Digerolamo was admitted to the Aley Coness-o Meoak Medical Center and managed by problems as follows.Flash Pulmonary Edema: The initial concern for Mrs. Kozicki was ofthis being an ischemic event causing her to have flash pulmonaryedema. However , coronary catheterization revealed the patient tohave clean coronaries. Echocardiogram revealed a left ventricularhypertrophy with a low normal systolic function , with an ejectionfraction of 50 to 55 percent. There was akinesis of the inferiorwall present. She had normal right ventricular size and function.She had 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation with mild left atrialenlargement and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with a regurgitivevelocity of about 2.7 meters per second consistent with minimalpulmonary systolic pressures. Subsequently the patient was notedto have had a history of hypothyroidism in the past , and she hadnormal TSH recently checked by her primary care physician , Dr.Slipper , of TCH . However , with no other etiology present , wewere worried about the patient having had tachyarrhythmia from someother source causing this. The Electrophysiology Serviceinterrogated the patient's pacer which revealed a number oftachyarrhythmias. A TSH panel was checked which revealed a TSH ofless than assay , and T4 free thyroxin index elevated. AnEndocrinology consultation was obtained , and they believed that thepatient's thyrotoxicosis was amiodarone induced. She was startedon Tapazole 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. They also suggested prednisone , butthe patient did refuse this. They recommended follow-up withEndocrine in about four to six weeks. Therefore , the finaletiology for the patient's flash pulmonary edema was amiodaroneinduced thyrotoxicosis causing increased susceptibility totachyarrhythmia , left ventricular hypertrophy , and possiblediastolic dysfunction , resulting in acute pump dysfunction , causingflash pulmonary edema. The final therapy for this problem willconsist of heavy nodal blockade. The patient will be blockadedwith calcium channel blockers , as well as Lopressor.Pneumonia: The patient was treated with clindamycin and did quitewell. Her white count fully resolved and she had no fever or othersymptoms of pneumonia. She will be discharged without any furtherantibiotics.Urinary Tract Infection: She had a lot of uric crystals , thereforeshe was placed on Bactrim Double Strength b.i.d. times a total ofseven days.Psychiatry: The patient has clearly severe anxiety and was in afull panic attack on admission. She was treated acutely withAtivan and her problem resolved quite well , and she became morecomfortable in the hospital.Diabetes Mellitus: Glyburide was held initially on admission. Shewas covered with insulin sliding scale. Glyburide was restarted onthe day of discharge. The patient was noted to have relativelyhigh blood sugars , and these should be followed as an outpatient.Blood sugars as high as the mid 300s were noted.Edema: The patient clearly had some fluid accumulation whichresolved with 20 mg of Lasix p.o. q.d. We will continue this andallow outpatient follow-up to determine whether or not she willneed this in the future.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,Tapazole 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 5.0mg p.o. q.p.m. , Bactrim Double Strength one tablet p.o. b.i.d.times four days after discharge , Prempro 0.625/2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol 150 mgp.o. q.d. , diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. q.d.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in good condition.FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Thyrotoxicosis.FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with Dr. Provins on Monday , 9/18at 9:30 a.m. , and Dr. Orejel of Chia Memorial Hospital Endocrinology at U Hay Rill , on 7/16 at 3:00p.m.Dictated By: MARKUS TRAFICANTE , M.D. LA93Attending: OSVALDO H.

The patient was initiallyanticoagulated with heparin drip for PTT goal of 60-80 , and wasbridged to Coumadin with an INR goal of 2-2.5. Lower extremitynoninvasive studies showed right leg deep venous thrombosis asnoted above. An IVC filter was placed without complications on10/18/06. The patient was discharged on a Coumadin dose of 7.5mg by mouth daily , and her INR will be followed by the Bit University Medical Center Coumadin Clinic ( Dr. Kent Ahlo ) , afterher discharge from rehabilitation.Cardiovascular: Rhythm: The patient was initially found to bein atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response , with aheart rate of approximately 128 beats per minute. This was feltlikely to be secondary to pulmonary embolus. The patientrequired both metoprolol and diltiazem for rate and rhythmcontrol , and was discharged on both of these medications. Shehad several episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation throughout herhospital course , requiring several boluses to metoprolol IV anddiltiazem IV. She was discharged on a regimen of metoprolol anddiltiazem p.o. to maintain her in stable normal sinus.Pump: The patient had an echocardiogram revealing ejectionfraction of 15% while she was in atrial fibrillation , andejection fraction of 25% when the patient was in normal sinusrhythm. She was diuresed gently with Lasix 20 mg by mouth daily.She was started on low-dose ACE inhibitor on 8/11/06.Ischemia: The patient has risk factors for coronary arterydisease , but has no chest pain or significant EKG changes duringthis admission. She may be considered for cardiaccatheterization in the future as an outpatient.Endocrine: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus with ahemoglobin A1c of 8.2. Oral anti-diabetics were held during thisadmission , the patient was given basal and prandial insulin. Shewas discharged back on her home diabetes regimen.Onch: The patient has a right lower lobe lung mass which islikely thymoma by a fine needle aspirate. The patient was seenby the Thoracic Surgery Service , as follow up for Dr. Evilsizerwho had seen her in clinic , and depending of the services thatsurgery was not recommended at this time until cardiovascular andpulmonary issues were stabilized. Medical oncology was alsoconsulted , and it was recommended that chemotherapy would not bepursued at this time for this patient. Both services recommendeda followup CT scan in several weeks to detect the progression ofthis right lower lobe lung mass. The decision of whether or notto treat this lung mass will be deferred until her pulmonaryembolism , cardiovascular , and pulmonary issues are stabilized.Neuro: The patient has a history of drinking two to four drinksper day , but the patient did not have any signs or symptoms ofalcohol withdrawal during this admission.Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient was repeatedwith electrolytes as necessary. She was given a cardiac andAmerican Diabetes Association Diet.Prophylaxis: The patient was initially on heparin , which in turnwas bridged to Coumadin.The patient was full code during this admission.PLANS: The patient should have regular blood draws to monitorher INR level while she is taking Coumadin. This will be managedby the Sher-pa Meroo Hase General Hospital Coumadin Clinic run by Dr.Cristobal Buckhanon , phone number 107-568-5779 while the patient isan outpatient. The patient should have diltiazem weaned off astolerated. ACE inhibitor and metoprolol should be titratedupwards as tolerated by heart rate and blood pressure.

JUDE IN April 1995.3 ) NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65 year old man with ahistory of rheumatic heart diseasestatus post aortic valve replacement times three who suffered acutebacterial endocarditis ( Staphylococcus aureus , not MRSA ) in 5/26He presented with nausea , vomiting times one , "a black out" ,weakness , and temperature of 101.2 the morning of admission. Thispatient was admitted back on 10/5/95 with fever times five days ,nasal congestion , and change in mental status. He was found in bedwith fecal incontinence and increased confusion at that time. Backin October 1995 , the initial TE showed no vegetation. He wastreated with Cefotaxime and Vancomycin. Patient subsequentlydeveloped atrial fibrillation with congestive heart failure and thehypertension. On October , he was intubated at which time a TEshowed aortic vegetations. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcusaureus and the antibiotics were changed to Oxacillin andTobramycin. Patient underwent a high risk redo aortic valvereplacement with St. Jude mechanical valve because of persistentsepsis. The antibiotics were narrowed to Oxacillin. Patient had anumber of septic embolic events and emboli were thrown to the brainwith a right MCA stroke and the spleen as well as the duodenum. On2/30 , he had an elevated white count , increasing temperature , andincreasing renal failure. At that time , the CT showed these renaland splenic abscesses and patient was taken to the Operating Room.He underwent a splenectomy and was found to have a perforatedduodenal ulcer. He underwent vagotomy with pyeloplasty. Thespleen showed multiple abscesses which grew out Candida. On thisadmission , the patient was in his usual state of good health untilone week prior to admission when he experienced fatigue. Atbaseline , the patient experienced intermittent sharp chest painfelt to be musculoskeletal secondary to open thoracic surgery.Patient also experienced pins and needle feelings felt in bothhands.

The patientwas unemployed on disability , he was a painter's rigger , andmarried times 24 years with four children from his first wife , nowliving with his second wife.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient's temperature was 101.6 , bloodpressure 96/60 , pulse 88 , and respirations28. HEENT: Pupils were equal and reactive to light andaccommodation , extraocular muscles were intact , normal funduscopicexamination , no Roth spots were noted , the oropharynx was benign ,and no petechiae were noted. NECK: Supple and there was nolymphadenopathy , his jugular venous distention was absent , an EJline was in place , and there was a 2+ carotid with zero bruits.CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Regular rateand rhythm , S1 and S2 , and there was a holosystolic II/VI systolicmurmur at the left sternal border with no S3 or S4 noted. Therewas a very crisp click from the St. Jude aortic valve. ABDOMEN:Examination showed positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , andnon-distended. RECTAL: Refused by patient. NEUROLOGICAL:Examination showed that the patient was alert and oriented timesthree , cranial nerves II-XII were intact , motor was 5/5 in all fourextremities distally and proximally , sensory was normal to lighttouch and proprioception , and the reflexes were equal andsymmetric. Cerebellar was slow , equal repetitive motions , and theF&F was slow but equal with good tracking grossly.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Of note , his white count was 19.1 with 18bands and 53 polys , hematocrit was 41.8 ,and the electrolytes were all within normal range. The bilirubinswere 0.8 total , alkaline phosphatase 82 , SGPT of 15 , and his PT was20.7 with an INR of 3.4. A transthoracic echo obtained uponadmission showed the aortic valve was in place , there was a 2.9meters per second flow through the aortic valve , and there was noabscess or vegetation noted. Patient had reportedly gotten twoblood cultures in Ari Norer Legulf Hospital and it turned out later that therehad only been one blood draw. One blood culture was also drawn inthe Emergency Room at the Thoter Coast Community Healthcare . Chestx-ray showed cardiomegaly , no infiltrate , and no congestive heartfailure and his EKG at admission showed normal sinus rhythm at 89with an axis of minus 20 , intervals were 0.26/0.90/0.36 , there wasa flipped T in lead I , aVL , V5 , and V6 , and there was first degreeAV block.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 65 year old gentleman who had had threeaortic valve replacements and had sufferedoverwhelming endocarditis as recently as six months ago in thereplaced St. Jude valve at that time with a high risk valve sincepatient was known to be febrile at the time of valve replacement.Therefore , the number one problem was to rule out endocarditis.The patient had two blood cultures , one at the Acraw Medical Center and oneat Ter'svenwhi Rywick Hospital , which were negative times 48 hourswhile the patient was maintained on Vancomycin and Gentamicin. Itwas judged that a TE would not change our treatment for thisgentleman and it was not obtained. An Infectious Diseaseconsultation was obtained and Infectious Disease recommendedobserving the patient on antibiotics for an extra 24 hours beforedeeming him non-bacteremic and then to observe the gentleman offantibiotics for 24 hours before discharging him. In regards toanti-coagulation , the patient was targeted for an INR of 3 with ahigh risk prosthetic heart valve. This was easily maintained usingthe patient's normal alternating 4 and 5 mg q.p.m. Coumadin. Finalissue was the patient's fall. It was judged that the patientactually became weak and went down on all fours controlling hisfall without actual syncope. The weakness could be attributed tothe patient's nausea , vomiting , dehydration , and vasovagal. Finalissue was the non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. While thepatient was hospitalized , the Glyburide was held and patient wasmaintained on a sliding scale of insulin. Patient's blood culturesremained negative times three days while patient was treated withVancomycin and Gentamicin. As per Infectious Diseaserecommendations , the intravenous antibiotics were held on the thirdday and then patient was observed for 24 hours off antibiotics. Hecontinued to remain afebrile through the entire hospitalization andpatient was discharged to home on September .DISPOSITION: Disposition is to home.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache ,Ventolin two puffs inhaled b.i.d. ,Beclovent two puffs inhaled b.i.d. , Beconase two puffs inhaledq.i.d. p.r.n. congestion , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Meclizine 25mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Senokot tablets twotablets p.o. q.a.m. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.o.d. alternating with 5mg p.o. q.o.d. , every day , patient took either 4 or 5 alternating ,and Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.

Hiswhite blood cell count had increased to 20. His INR had beensupratherapeutic on admission at that time to 14. At that time ,he had had a transesophageal echocardiogram which did not showany vegetations and he was discharged to rehab on 3/15/06 with acourse of IV penicillin through a PICC line , as well as oralFlagyl empirically for an elevated white count. At the rehabfacility where he was placed , the patient was found to havepulled his PICC line and the patient was complaining of beingshort of breath and having some mental status changes. He wastreated with some sublingual nitroglycerin at the outsidefacility and brought to the Ellwis Medical Center Emergency Room , where a chestx-ray showed some lack of the PICC line and the short of breathquickly improved in the emergency room. He was , however ,lethargic and then at times , apneic in the emergency room. A gaswas performed which showed respiratory alkalosis with a pH of7.5 , a pCO2 of 34 and a pAO2 of 135. The patient then becameslightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures to the 90s ,was given IV fluid boluses as well as treated empirically withvancomycin and ceftazidime , to which his blood pressure respondedby going up to around 100-110/60. Given his apnea , a CPAP wasinitiated in the emergency department and his oxygenation issuesquickly resolved. A head CT was performed , which was negative.A right internal jugular line was placed and gentle rehydrationtherapy according to early goal-directed therapy for peri-sepsiswas initiated , given the presumption of repeat bacteremia andearly sepsis. He was admitted to medicine for furthermanagement.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in2004 and a cath in 2005. He is status post a hip fracture in2005. He has peripheral vascular disease , diabetes , COPD but notreported to be on any home oxygenation , dementia , Paget disease ,atrial fibrillation , BPH , congestive heart failure , EF of 45-50% ,hypertension , diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included the following: Glucotrol 10 mgp.o. b.i.d. and lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day , metformin 500 mgp.o. t.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. x10 days which was startedon 5/5/06 , sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. , nystatin suspensionq.i.d. , Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. q. h.s. , Penicillin G 3 million unitsIV q. 4h x7 days , Milk of Magnesia , Tylenol p.r.n. , Dulcolaxp.r.n. , Colace p.r.n. , atenolol 50 mg q. day , Lipitor 20 mg q.day , Senna liquid q. h.s. , Flomax 0.4 q. day.ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a history of heavy tobacco use. He quit40 years ago. He lives at home with a 24-hour attendant and herarely uses alcohol.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM notable for the following: Histemperature was 95.9 , his heart rate was 60 , his blood pressurewas 110/62. He is satting 98% on a CPAP machine. In general , hewas in no acute distress in restraints. His head and neck examwas notable for a supple neck. Pupils are equal , round andreactive. His heart demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm. HisJVP was flat. He did not demonstrate any murmurs , rubs , orgallops. His pulmonary exam was clear anteriorly. His abdominalexam was noted for being soft , nontender , and nondistended withpositive bowel sounds and mild tympani. He had good peripheralpulses with trace lower extremity edema. His neuro exam wasnonfocal.OPERATIONS: During his hospital stay at this time included a PEGtube placement which happened on 10/25/06.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. ID: The patient has a history of recent strep oralisbacteremia and leukocytosis. He was afebrile at the time ofadmission; however , given concern for possible early sepsis givenhis blood pressure , he was treated with empiric IV fluids andantibiotics with vancomycin and ceftazidime. His chest x-raylooked like it might have some aspiration and he was treated withan empiric 7-day course of Ceptaz and Flagyl for aspirationpneumonia. This course was completed earlier in his hospitalstay. He was also initially treated with vancomycin. A PICC wasplaced on 8/7/06 for further antibiotic management of hisbacteremia. His vancomycin was switched to IV penicillin andthis will be continued for a full 3-4 week course on 1/15/07. ATEE was considered unnecessary given the fact that he was goingto be treated anyway with antibiotics for 4 weeks. All blood ,urine , sputum cultures and stool cultures remained no growth todate at the time of discharge.2. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient demonstrated someapnea in the Emergency Department which resolved with CPAP;however , given the fact that the patient was a significantaspiration risk , a CPAP was considered unnecessary and possiblywould increase the risk of aspiration. Pulmonary was consulted ,who felt that the patient was demonstrating Cheyne-Stokesrespirations secondary to possible CHF or history of CVAs that hehas had in the past. His ABG , as I mentioned above , demonstratedrespiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.His repeat ABG showed no significant change , which likelyindicates a chronic process. He did not demonstrate any PEs onstudies that were performed here. No pneumonia was noted and thedesaturations that were detected while the patient was sleepingovernight on 15 units O2 sat monitor resolved quickly with 2liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. A plan was made to notreinitiate CPAP given the aspiration risk. He was initiallydiuresed mildly with Lasix. This was eventually discontinued.The patient should receive nighttime supplemental oxygen ,particularly if he desaturates to less than 90%.3. Cardiovascular: The patient is status post an MI , statuspost PCI in 2004. His enzymes were negative on this admissionand a repeat EKG was unchanged from previous. The patient wasrestarted on his home doses of aspirin , statin , beta blocker 2pump. The patient's ejection fraction was 45-50% with inferiorwall hypokinesis. Hypotension improved on admission , restartedhis beta blocker and his ACE inhibitor and IV fluids at the timeof discharge. Re the patient's history of a-fib , he was innormal sinus rhythm for the majority of his hospital stay.Coumadin was held peri-procedure when he was getting his PEGplaced and vitamin K had been administered in view of hissupratherapeutic Coumadin. His Coumadin should be restarted on2/18/07. Of note as well for rhythm issues , the patient waskept on potassium and magnesium scales while in hospital and hehas a partial pacemaker placed for his sick sinus syndrome.4. GI: The patient had a history of constipation. His abdomenwas tympanitic when he first presented. He was given a bowelregimen and has subsequently begun making good solid stool.Midway through his hospital course , the patient developed troublewith eating. He had multiple NG tubes placed which he wasself-discontinuing requiring urgent reconsideration of morepermanent feeding tubes. A discussion was held between ourservice and the GI team , who felt that a PEG would be useful formanaging this patient's feeding in the future. On 10/1/06 , GIendoscopically placed a PEG tube for future feeding. Nutritionwas consulted and tube feeds were re-initiated that evening.Again , his Coumadin will be held until 9/14/07 so as to promoteappropriate wound healing around the site of the PEG placement.5. Heme: The patient had a history of anemia but did notdemonstrate any acute hematocrit drops. His INR on admission was1.9. We had transiently restarted Coumadin but he will have torestart that again on 9/14/07 , given the fact that it was heldfor his PEG placement. He was continued on iron supplementsduring his hospital stay.6. Renal: The patient , as discussed above , has demonstrated arespiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.His creatinine was mildly elevated which is secondary to chronicrenal insufficiency for unclear reasons. His creatinine by thetime of discharge had improved dramatically to 0.7.7. Endocrine: The patient's oral hypoglycemics were held duringthis hospital stay. He was started on insulin sliding-scale andLantus. As his feeding has increased and his tube feeds havereached goal , his Lantus has had to be titrated up. He iscurrently at 15 units q. p.m. He may need more while at thefacility that he is going to.8. GU: The patient has a history of vesiculous spermatocele orhydrocele , which is going to be followed by urology as anoutpatient. We had held his Flomax initially given low bloodpressure but we restarted it during his hospital stay here.9. FEN: As mentioned above , the patient is on aspirationprecautions secondary to speech and swallow evaluation that wasconsistent with aspiration. NG tubes were placed multiple timesbut were self-discontinued by the patient. Finally , a PEG tubewas placed on 3/2 and tube feeds were reinitiated that evening.10: Psych: The patient has a history of being mildly agitated.Zyprexa was initiated here at home doses of 2.5 mg q. day andthen titrated up to 2.5 mg b.i.d. The patient has responded verynicely to this and is no longer agitated.11. Prophylaxis: He was kept on TEDS and P-boots. Coumadin asmentioned above will need to be restarted on 9/14/07 and Nexiumwas to continue while he is here.The patient is full code. His contacts include his son ( 755 ) 304-4394 and Hillesheim , his daughter ( 041 ) 769-5379.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: See addendumDISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a temperature of 98.4 Tmax , his current is 96.6. His heart rate is in the 90s. Hisblood pressure has been stable in the 110-120s/70-80s. Hisrespirations have been 18-20 , satting 92-96% on room air. Ingeneral , he is in no acute distress. His lungs are with coarsebilateral breath sounds. His rate and rhythm were regularwithout murmurs. His abdomen is soft and nontender with goodbowel sounds. His extremities are without edema.He is to be discharged today , 2/27/06 , to rehabilitation wherethey will focus primarily on his physical therapy and rehabneeds.eScription document: 7-3955349 HSSten TelDictated By: MADONNA , BRANDONAttending: EMMANUEL CLEMENT CRITTLE , M.D. BX9Dictation ID 8216959D: 2/27/06T: 2/27/06

SINUSITIS.2. STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old gentlemanstatus post cardiac transplant ( 11/27 )who was transferred to the Nasstrict Hospital Of with ahistory of hemoptysis.The patient underwent cardiac transplantation in 1991 for severeischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient had a rather unremarkablecourse except for the development of some graft CAD ( seen on lastcatheterization ). The patient was admitted from 11/17/96 to6/24/96 with a two month history of sputum production. Thepatient was empirically started on IV cefotaxime and hiscyclosporine was adjusted up to 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient'sshortness of breath and respiratory problems subsequently resolved.A CT of the chest showed prior granulomatous involvement of thelung and spleen. The patient had AFB times three done: allnegative. The patient did have Mycobacterium avium grow out in hissputum; however , this organism was not felt to be a pathogen forhim. After the patient was discharged , the patient continuedcontinued to have persistent ear fullness and pain , and a thick ,but clear , nasal discharge. Then , approximately one week ago , thepatient noted increasing cough. The patient denies any associatedfevers or chills. On the day prior to admission , the patient notedhis sputum was blood tinged. The patient subsequently coughed upapproximately one quarter cup of bright red blood , which wasapparently witnessed in the Emergency Room at the outside hospital.The patient apparently had some more hemoptysis ( amount notdocumented ) on the night of admission; however , the patient has nothad any further hemoptysis since then ( approximately 20 hours ).PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Status post cardiac transplantation in1991 ( secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy ).2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Status post coronaryartery bypass graft. 4. Status post a left ventral hernia repair.5. Status post a right ankle fracture. 6. Status post goring bybull in 1987. 7. Liver laceration. 8. Hypertension. 9.

Imuran175 mg p.o. q.h.s.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife in Jo The patient was a janitor until 1/19 Thepatient smoked a half pack per day times 30 years. The patientdrinks only socially ( occasionally ).FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 78.Mother alive , but has diabetes mellitus ,congestive heart failure , and coronary artery disease.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On vitals , temperature was 97.9 , bloodpressure 160/100 , heart rate 106 ,respirations 20 , and O2 saturation 96% on two liters. The patientis an elderly gentleman lying in his bed in no acute distress.HEENT examination was normocephalic , atraumatic. Pupils wereequal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocularmuscles were intact. There was no lymphadenopathy. JVP wasapproximately 7 cm , with no carotid bruits. Cardiac examinationrevealed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs ,rubs , or gallops. Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , obese ,nontender , and nondistended. Extremities had 2+ bilateral lowerextremity edema. Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal.LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 was notable for glucose 284 , creatinine1.2. CBC revealed a white count of 4 , hematocrit35.2 , and platelets 191 , 000. PT was 13 , PTT 28.2.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient had no hemoptysis throughout hisMo Hospital hospitalization.The patient was scheduled for , and underwent , bronchoscopy on4/3/96 , which revealed bronchiectasis of the anterior segment ofthe left lower lobe ( where the CT abnormalities were seen ).Purulent secretions were also encountered and sent for appropriatecultures and tests. No evidence of malignancy was seen. ThePulmonary team did recommend starting the patient on appropriateantimicrobial coverage for MAI. Therefore , the patient was startedon clarithromycin and ethambutol. Given that these medicationseffect the liver cytochrome P450 system , the patient's cyclosporine doserequired adjustment downward to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to keep his levels200-300. The patient also underwent CT scan of his maxillofacialarea on 9/12/96. This scan revealed air levels in both maxillarysinuses , as well as the sphenoid sinuses. Subtotal opacificationwas seen in most of the ethmoid air cells. Also , subtotalopacification of the mastoid air cells was demonstratedbilaterally. The frontal sinuses appeared minimally developed; ofthe few air cells present , there was complete opacification. Theoverall impression was pain and sinus disease with leftotomastoiditis. The patient underwent further evaluation in theENT Clinic on 7/24/96 ; their recommendations included Biaxin timesfour weeks ( the patient will be on this medication for at leastfour weeks for coverage of MAI ). The Infectious Disease teamrecommends that the patient's repeat AFBs be followed up and , ifthey are followed up , clarithromycin and ethambutol could bestopped after six weeks versus 18-24 months of therapy. ThePulmonary team also recommended that the patient be started onAlbuterol and Atrovent inhalers and have a set of pulmonaryfunction tests obtained as an outpatient. It is also recommendedthat the patient be started on a cholesterol lowering agent at hisnext Transplant Clinic visit ( LDL came back at 151 after patient'sdischarge ).DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Procardia XL 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,cyclosporine 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ethambutol1 , 500 mg p.o. q.day , Atrovent metered dose inhaler two puffsq.i.d. , Imuran 175 mg p.o. q.h.s. , clarithromycin 500 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Afrin two sprays n.a. b.i.d. times three days , and OceanSpray two sprays n.a. q.day.CONDITION: Fair.DISPOSITION: To home , follow up appointment in the TransplantClinic on 8/26/96 ; the patient also instructed toarrange a follow up appointment with Dr. Gullace ( Pulmonary ).

SICK SINUS SYNDROME STATUS POST DDDRPACEMAKER.CHIEF COMPLAINT: Briefly , this is an 80 year-old woman withcoronary history of hypertension , diabetes andatrial fibrillation admitted to Friends Medical Center on the 12 of September for congestive heart failure and was at the time ,diagnosed with receptive aphasia and a right hemianopsia. CT ofhead was negative at that time and she was diagnosed with right MCAstroke. She was started on anticoagulation as well as Lasix andnitrites. Echocardiogram at the outside hospital revealed anejection fraction of 40 to 45%. She was transferred to the Stie Dickhall Hospital on the 3 of November for further evaluationhere.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1. Sick sinus syndrome ,complete heart block status post DDDRpacemaker. 2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 3. DVT in 1992 ,4. Right TKA , 5. Coronary artery disease , 6. CHF , 7.Depression. 8.

Hypertension.ALLERGIES: Include quinidine , procainamide and disopyramide.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include Heparin , Lasix , Insulin , Cozaar ,Imdur , aspirin , Humulin and sotalol.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Was notable for: She had atemperature of 99.9 , bloodpressure of 108/54 , pulse of 78 , 95% on four liters. She is anobese , elderly woman in no apparent distress. HEAD AND NECK: Examrevealed oral mucosa was moist. Normocephalic , atraumatic. NECK:Notable for JVD of 11 to 12 cm. , no bruits. LUNGS: Crackles 1/3of the way up bilaterally. She had regular rate and rhythm with nomurmurs , rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , benign. She had 1+edema bilaterally; 1+ pulses. NEURO: Notable for alert andoriented to time , place and person. Her language is notable for areceptive aphasia. Her cranial nerves II through XII were intactexcept for right hemianopsia. MOTOR: Gait was grossly normal.Grip strength was 5/5 and symmetric. SENSORY: Grossly normal.DTRs were 1+ and symmetric throughout. Toes were downgoingbilaterally.LABS ON ADMISSION: Were noted before of BUN , creatinine of 26/0.8 ,K of 2.4. LFTs were within normal limits.Initial CK was 42. She had an LDL of 42 , HDL of 30. TSH was 1.89 ,Troponin was 0.12. White count was 10.2 , hematocrit of 31 ,platelets of 156. Her INR was 1.3 , PTT was 35.7 , urinalysisrevealed 40 to 50 white cells , 1+ bacteria and 2+ leukocyteesterase. Her chest x-ray was normal.HOSPITAL COURSE BY ORGAN SYSTEM: 1. Neuro: The patient waslikely to have a left MCA strokeat the outside hospital. Repeat CT at Er/na Hospitalconfirmed these findings. She was continued on anticoagulationsince it was felt that most likely the etiology of stroke wascardioembolic given her cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias. Ofnote , she remained stable until the evening of the 10 of June when shewas found to have depressed mental status and new left hemiparesis.Repeated head CT was unchanged and she was felt to have a new rightMCA stroke again due to cardioembolic causes. At this time , thefamily made a decision to make her DNR/DNI. She was continued onaspirin and started on full heparinization. Her neurologic statusremained stable and she has improved slowly. Her swallowingimproved and over the next several days ate normally. Shecontinued to have a receptive aphasia although this improved andshe was able to repeat although her naming remained poor. Physicaltherapy and speech were consulted and followed the patient. Shecontinues to do well. Follow-up CTs have remained unchanged. Shewill undergo a SPECT examination to confirm this stroke butotherwise she has been transitioned to Coumadin for long-termanticoagulation.2. Cardiovascular: She is felt to have , given her new depressedejection fraction and Troponin leak , she was felt to possibly havecoronary disease and she was expected to go to coronary angiographygiven her progressive neurologic symptoms. This was deferred andshe will be continued on conservative therapy including aspirin andanticoagulation. She was felt to be in some congestive heartfailure and has been diuresed gently with some improvement in heroxygenation and cardiac exam.

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 4/11/2006 Report Status: SignedDischarge Date: 10/20/2006ATTENDING: PUSSER , ROLLAND M.D.CHIEF COMPLAINT:Chest and left arm pain , and left arm paresthesias.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:This is a 47-year-old female with a past medical history , whichincludes HIV positive , hepatitis C positive , seizures , andneuropathy , who presented complaining of left hand paresthesiasfollowed by left hand pain that marches proximally up her leftarm and affecting her left shoulder and chest. Along with thesesymptoms , she has associated shortness of breath , palpitations ,lightheadedness , diaphoresis , and nausea. The patient notes thatthese symptoms have been occurring approximately five times perweek over the past two months. She has notified her PCP of theseevents , however , the etiology has never been identified. Ofnote , the patient states that these symptoms have increased infrequency since having two syncopal events , which occurred threedays prior to admission.Regarding syncope , the patient recalls her first loss ofconsciousness episode occurring three days ago in her bedroom.There were no antecedent symptoms. She came back toconsciousness while on the ground , called out for help and herdaughter came immediately. There was no witnessed seizureactivity , no postictal confusion , no tongue trauma nor was thereany incontinence. A second episode of syncope occurred two daysprior to arrival while the patient was standing in the bathroom.There was some preceding lightheadedness this time. Thepost-event characteristics were the same. Again , the patient wasfound by her son when she called out for help.The patient denies prior history of syncopal events , however , shedoes have a lifelong history of seizures and has not been takingher Keppra for approximately a year , as her prescription has ranout and she has failed to keep follow-up appointments with herprimary neurologist , Dr. Loock Both the patient and herdaughter note that she usually has postictal confusion and thatthese syncopal events did not fit that description. Furthermore ,these episodes did not feel like her occasional hypoglycemicepisodes. Unfortunately , the patient's blood sugars were notobtained during these syncopal events.Of note , the patient recently started Flexeril to treat chroniclow back pain.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:The patient admits stable three-pillow orthopnea , but newparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no lower extremity edema , weightloss or increased abdominal girth. The patient has stablefour-block ambulation limited by dyspnea. She has had notableweight loss as she has decreased in dress size from 18-14 overthe past nine months. She denies fevers or chills.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:HIV positive , drug-seeking behavior , parotitis , migraineheadaches , anxiety and panic , depression , hepatitis C , seizures ,neuropathy , pancreatitis , abnormal Pap smear , diabetes mellitus ,cerebral aneurysm , herpes simplex type 1 , and chronic low backpain.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:Flexeril 5 mg daily , clonazepam 1 mg q.i.d. , Truvada one tabletdaily , Norvir 1400 mg b.i.d. , glyburide 5 mg q.a.m. and 2.5 mgq.p.m. , Lomotil one tablet q.i.d. p.r.n. , methadone 150 mg daily ,Zofran 4 mg daily p.r.n. , Percocet 325 mg/5 mg tablets one tabletq.6 h. p.r.n. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , Zoloft 100 mg q.a.m. , andtrazodone 100 mg nightly.ALLERGIES:Compazine , Bactrim , didanosine , gabapentin , cephalosporins ,penicillin , clindamycin , stavudine , Tylenol No.3 , levofloxacin ,clindamycin , tetanus , IV contrast , ibuprofen , abacavir andritonavir.SOCIAL HISTORY:The patient is from Reve Abilester She is living with her daughterand son. No prior tobacco or smoking history. She has a priorhistory of drinking alcohol and IV drug use.FAMILY HISTORY:Negative for early coronary artery disease. Her father had an MIat age 74. Her mother had coronary artery disease at age 76.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 172/80 , heart rate 82 ,respiratory rate 20 , and saturating 100% on room air. This is amiddle-aged woman appearing older than stated age , complaining ofleft hand pain , but otherwise appears comfortable. She has adisconjugate gaze , has only light vision in her left eye.Sclerae are anicteric. Oropharynx is benign. She had no oralulcers or thrush. Neck is supple , without cervicallymphadenopathy , no JVD , and no carotid bruits. Lungs are clearto auscultation. Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no murmurs ,rubs or gallops. Abdomen was obese , soft , nondistended , andnontender with questionable splenic fullness , no clubbing ,cyanosis or edema. She had a 4 x 4 ecchymosis on her leftshoulder and a 2 x 2 scab over her left elbow. The soft tissueextending from the left shoulder to left elbow was tender topalpation as was the left chest. She had decreased sensation ofbilateral lower extremities and left. Aside from a disconjugategaze , cranial nerves were intact. Motor exam was intact. Gaitwas slightly wide-based , but sufficient without cane. NegativeRomberg , negative pronator drift , and no dysmetria onfinger-to-nose bilateral , and deep tendon reflexes were 2+throughout.ADMISSION LABORATORY VALUES:Sodium 138 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 103 , CO2 28 , BUN 13 ,creatinine 0.7 , glucose 179 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 1.6 , ALT 35 ,AST 34 , alkaline phosphatase 57 , CK 51 , CK-MB 1.4 , troponin lessthan assay , white count of 3.35 , hemoglobin 12.6 , hematocrit36.7 , PT 14.4 , INR 1.1 , and PTT 29.5.ADMISSION DATA:Chest x-ray was within normal limits. EKG was normal sinusrhythm without ischemic change. CAT scan of the head was withinnormal limits. Left shoulder and arm plain films were negativefor fracture or dislocation.IMPRESSION:This is a 47-year-old female with a history significant for HIV ,diabetes , questionable cerebral aneurysm , and seizure disorder( not taking Keppra for the past year ) , who recently had twosyncopal events without prodrome and without postictal state( thus unlikely a seizure in etiology ) , who presented forevaluation of left arm paresthesias and chest pain , withassociated diaphoresis , shortness of breath and nausea , which hasbeen intermittently occurring over the past two months.During this admission , the patient had frequent recurrences ofher left arm and chest pain symptoms , which were related tosyncopal events. Thus , the medical team does not think thatthese two issues are related. The patient underwent an extensivesyncopal evaluation , however , the etiology was never identified.The etiology of the patient's left arm and chest symptoms andsyndromes also was not identified during this admission , however ,the medical team suspects it may be related to a cervical spinousprocess , potentially arthritis , disc herniation or nerve rootimpingement. Please see below for more details. The remainderof the dictation will be divided into system:1. Cardiovascular: The patient underwent an extensivecardiovascular evaluation , all of which was negative.a. Pump: Given the patient's history of HIV and takingantiretroviral , there was a concern about associatedcardiomyopathy. Echocardiogram that was performed was completelywithin normal limits. The patient did not exhibit signs ofparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea during this admission.Dyspnea on exertion could be related to decondition.b. Rhythm: The patient's telemetry history on 11/8/2006 wasnotable for a nonsustained 5-beat run of wide complex tachycardiawith rates in the 150's. This was immediately followed by anonsustained 4-beat run of narrow complex tachycardia.Cardiology consult was placed to review the telemetry strip andto assess for referral to EP Service for potential AICD. Giventhe negative echocardiogram , the Card Service wanted to rule outischemia-induced arrhythmia , so a MIBI was performed , and thepatient was started on low-dose beta-blocker and aspirin. Theadenosine MIBI was within normal limits. The telemetry strip wasreviewed by the EP Service and diagnosed the patient withnonsustained SVT with aberrancy. The Card Service then advisedthat there was no need for AICD. They stated that if tolerated ,the beta-blocker could be continued and that the patient shouldbe set up as an outpatient for a loop recorder. This will becoordinated through the patient's PCP. Of note , after startingmetoprolol 12.5 b.i.d. , the patient had occasional bradycardia tothe high 40's. Thus , it was determined that this medicationshould be discontinued as it may be impairing the patient'sexercise tolerance.c. Ischemia: Coronary disease risk factors include diabetes andfamily history. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction , hadno ischemic change on her EKG , and had a negative MIBI. Nofurther workup for coronary artery disease was indicated. Alipid panel was completely within normal limits and suggestingtreatment was not indicated.d. Miscellaneous: On 6/10/2006 , the patient was evaluated forone of her left arm and chest pain events. The patient was notedto be diaphoretic and complained of nausea and shortness ofbreath. The symptoms occurred while the patient was lying inbed. Upon arrival by the team , her blood pressure was 90/56 ,heart rate was 56 , she had poor pallor , was diaphoretic , anddescribed chest pain radiating up and down her arm. EKG intelemetry during the event was normal sinus rhythm with any acuteST or T-wave changes. The event spontaneously resolved in lessthan 15 minutes without medical intervention.2. Neuro: The patient has a history of convulsive seizures andhas been noncompliant with Keppra for the past 12 months becauseshe failed to keep neuro appointment with Dr. Sconiers and hasbeen unable to obtain refills. Per the patient , her recentsyncopal events were without prodrome and without postictalstate. Thus , were unlikely prior seizures and unlikely seizurein focus. An EEG was performed during this admission anddemonstrated no definite focal or epileptiform features. Kepprawas restarted at 250 mg b.i.d. with a goal to increase to 500 mgb.i.d. after 7 days and to 750 mg after another week. There wasa question of a history of cerebral aneurysm , diagnosed at anoutside facility , which was never confirmed by Tonfay Medical Center imaging. MRI of the brain and MRA of the head and neckobtained this admission was negative for hemorrhage , mass , edema ,hydrocephalus , infarction , and negative for abnormal enhancement.There was no aneurysm high-flow AVM or stenosis found , and MRAof the neck had no significant abnormality. The patient'sneurologist , Dr. Klez , was aware of this admission. Afollow-up appointment has been made.3. Endocrine: History of diabetes type II , hemoglobin A1c of6.1 , reflects excellent outpatient glycemic control , however , thepatient reports becoming diaphoretic with normal glycemic levelsbetween 80 and 100. Given recent weight loss without glyburidedose adjustment , the medical team decreased glyburide to 2.5 mgdaily for the patient to begin upon discharge. During thisadmission , the all oral agents were held and the patient wastreated with the Ryo Hospital Medical Center insulin protocol.4. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of HIVpositive , CD4 count on 11/21/2006 was 217. The viral load wasless than assay. The patient continued on Truvada and Lexiva.The patient complained of dysuria on 7/26/2006. Urinalysis wasordered , but symptoms resolved before specimen could be sent thelab.5. Pain: History of chronic pain and lumbar spine herniations.The methadone dose of 155 mg was confirmed with the outpatientclinic. No additional regular narcotics were given during thisadmission.6. Heme: The patient has chronic pancytopenia. She has anormocytic normochromic anemia with normal iron studies , B12 andfolate , and a low reticulocyte index consistent with anemia ofchronic disease , likely from HIV immunosuppression.7. Miscellaneous: The patient was screened by the PhysicalTherapy Service who recommended a home safety evaluation. Thiswill be coordinated to the Tlandgilb O Visiting Nurses Association.Given the liability and predictability of events , the teamimplemented a 24-hour urine collection to assess forpheochromocytoma. The results of the studies are pending at thetime of this discharge. The patient may have autonomicdysregulation as part of her diabetes. Alternatively , themedical team speculates that the patient may have cervical spinalarthritis , lumbar herniation or nerve root impingementcontributing to these symptoms. Of note , the patient states thatthese episodes had occurred more frequently inpatient and theywere at home. It was until the day of discharge that it wasnoted that the patient was not receiving her Klonopin 1 mg q.i.d.as she had prior to admission. In fact , she has only receivedthree doses of Klonopin over a six-day period. It is unclearwhat role anxiety is playing into these events. On the day ofdischarge , the patient stated that she was making arrangements tosee an orthopedic specialist at Laly County Health forevaluation of her cervical spine.FINAL DIAGNOSES:1. Syncope , not otherwise specified.2. Left arm pain/left chest pain/left arm paresthesias ( nototherwise specified ).DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Ecotrin 81 mg daily , clonazepam 1 mg q.6 h. p.r.n. , Imodium oneto two tablets q.i.d. p.r.n. for diarrhea , Truvada one tabletp.o. daily , Lexiva 1400 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 2.5 mg daily ,Keppra 500 mg b.i.d. for 14 doses and then 750 mg b.i.d.indefinitely , methadone 155 mg daily , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. ,Zoloft 300 mg daily , trazodone 100 mg at bedtime p.r.n. , andZofran 4 mg daily p.r.n. for nausea.MEDICAL FOLLOW UP:On 10/24/2006 , the patient is scheduled to see her PCP , Dr. Les Orosco On 10/21/2006 , she is scheduled to see her psychiatrist ,Dr. Damien Scherzer On 4/8/2006 , she is scheduled to seeher Infectious Disease , Dr. Marion Callais On 7/6/2006 , she isscheduled to see her neurologist , Dr. Shane Bemberry Inaddition , the patient is going to be followed by the Na Riventtortonlis Jo VNAwho will do a medication reconciliation and home safetyevaluation.SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:1.

Fallsto left on tandem gait.Non-contrast head CT negative for evidence of stroke or hemorrhage.Hospital course: the pt was admitted with hypertension and recentheadaches , visual changes ( blurred vision ) , change in gait ( inabilityto walk in heels ) , and recent confusion. Neurologic exam wassignificant for right hypertropic skew without diplopia , left facialweakness that is old per pt and LMR notes , mild slowing of right finefinger movements , and tendency to fall towards the left on tandem gait.These findings do not localize well and the differential diagnosiswas felt to include cerebral ischemia/infarction and hypertensiveencephalopathy. The patient had recent poorly-controlledhypertension as well as symptoms of possible heart failure includingexertional dyspnea and orthopnea.An MRI was ordered to evaluate for possible stroke or hypertensiveencephalopathy. Unfortunately , the pt was not able to tolerate theprocedure , citing claustrophobia from a traumatic childhood experienceas a prohibitive factor. Her atenolol was continued and she was placedon aspirin 325 mg qd for stroke and heart prophylaxis. Her bloodpressures remained well-controlled throughout admission and sheremained asymptomatic , without recurrent headache , confusion , andweakness. Her fine finger movements with the right hand were improvedby hospital day 2. She continued to have difficulty with tandem gait ,falling to the left. Her lipid profile revealed elevated totalcholesterol and LDL. Her homocysteine level was slightly elevated at14. She was instructed to raise her dose of atorvastatin as well assupplement her diet with folic acid. She has an outpt appointment forcarotid non-invasive studies 10/25/03.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:DISCHARGE CONDITION: FairTO DO/PLAN:The pt should take a full dose of aspirin ( 325 mg ). She should takefolate supplementation. She should also discuss raising her dose ofatorvastatin ( Lipitor ) with her PCP , because her cholesterol and LDLwere elevated this admission.No dictated summaryENTERED BY: LIDDER , LENARD JEFFERSON , M.D. ( IQ99 ) 3/10/03 @ 05****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******

FAT EMBOLI SYNDROME.2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.3. DECUBITUS ULCERS.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lumadue is a 68-year-old man whocame in with a chief complaint of hippain after a mechanical fall. The patient had been hospitalized in4/17 for ischemic right toes requiring debridement and amputation.At that time , his hospital course was complicated by a non-Q waveMI. Cardiology have recommended medical management with Lopressorat that time and an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of45%. Dobutamine MIBI revealed a severe fixed perfusion defect inthe inferoposterior and inferoseptal left ventricle without anyperi-infarct ischemia. Ejection fraction by MIBI imaging was 26%in contrast to the echo results. The patient was ultimatelydischarged on Lopressor , however , she stopped taking the Lopressorfor unclear reasons. For the few months prior to admission , hedeveloped increasing dyspnea on exertion with paroxysmal nocturnaldyspnea and increasing pedal edema , as well as nocturia , however ,denied any orthopnea , any chest pain , fevers , melena , bright redblood per rectum or palpitations. A few days prior to admission ,the patient developed a dry cough and some rhinorrhea.On the morning of admission , the patient sustained a mechanicalfall while trying to retrieve a newspaper. He had nolight-headedness , palpitations , pain in his chest , nausea orvomiting , sweating or change in vision or sensory symptoms prior toor after the fall. The patient fell onto his left side andimmediately developed left-sided leg and hip pain for which shepresented to the emergency room at Fentstraub Neycian's Medical Center .PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy( ischemic ) , peripheral vascular disease ,status post amputation of right-sided toes , status post rightfemoral to PT avascularization , diabetes type II , status post CVA ,hypertension.MEDICATIONS: HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mgp.o. q.d. , Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , glyburide 5 mgp.o. q.d. , multivitamins , cough medicine p.r.n.ALLERGIES: Aminoglycosides , unknown reaction.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking one pack perday x40 years , quit five years prior to admission.He has one drink of liquor per day , lives at home alone in Targtine Highway , Birm , Vermont 21711 , and is in the insurance business.FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for mother died of cancer at 74. Fatherdied at 55 of heart disease. Mother died at 50 ofa heart attack.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile , temperature 97.3 ,heart rate 106 , blood pressure 162/77 ,oxygenation 94% on room air. GENERAL: He was alert and oriented.LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. PELVIS: Stable.His left lower extremity had well-healed scars from donor site forbypass grafting , strong dopplerable PT and DP pulses. His left legwas externally rotated. Sensation was intact to light touch.LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 135 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , bicarb19 , BUN 56 , creatinine 2.5. White count 12 ,hematocrit 33 , platelets 388. PTT 40.5 , INR 1.2. EKG showed sinustach at 102 , with occasional PVCs , normal axis , normal intervals ,no evidence of ischemia. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonaryedema. X-rays of his left pelvis and femur revealed fracture ofthe left intertrochanter and subtrochanteric fracture with lessertrochanteric fracture intact by 3 cm , less than five degreesangulation. His femoral head was reduced.IMPRESSION: A 68-year-old man with significant cardiac historyand vascular disease , status post left hip fracturewith mechanical fall , with pulmonary edema noted on chest x-ray.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - Initially , the patient wasto be admitted to the orthopedic service withmedicine consult for wrist stratification. However , the patientwas transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation andmanagement. The patient was noted to have a troponin leak althoughCK enzymes remained negative for ischemia. He had a MIBI performedwhich revealed an unchanged fixed defect. He remained in sinustach with occasional PVCs and runs of nonsustained ventriculartachycardia lasting 3-4 beats at a time throughout his admission.Sinus tach was attributed pain and discomfort , possibly withelement of hypoxia contributing as well. A troponin leak wasattributed to strain particularly in the setting of histachycardia. He was started on beta blocker , Ace inhibitor andcontinued on an aspirin. He was aggressively diuresed withafterload reduction. He was titrated upward as noted.2. Pulmonary - The patient's crackles persisted on lung exam afteraggressive diuresis , prompting performance of a chest CT whichrevealed an interstitial pattern with peripheral nodularityconsistent with fat emboli syndrome , positive component ofcongestive heart failure and aspiration pneumonia as well. Thepatient was continued on a regimen of Lasix for diuresis and wastreated for aspiration pneumonia as noted below. His oxygenrequirement diminished over a few days and he was maintained on twoliters of nasal cannula oxygen at the time of transfer to rehab.3. Renal - The patient developed some renal failure in the settingof diuresis , which improved with hydration. The patientsubsequently tolerated further diuresis with improvement in hiscreatinine and it is possible that renal failure is due to fatemboli syndrome as well and should improve slowly.4. ID - The patient was treated with vancomycin , Flagyl andlevofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia , course completed6/18/02. The patient remained afebrile. His white blood count onadmission and discharge was 12.5. Neurologically - The patient apparently had baseline mildperfusion. The possibly worsened due to the fat embolic syndromeand was at baseline prior to discharge per the patient's daughter.6. Heme - The patient was continued on Lovenox 60 mg subcu. b.i.d.for prophylaxis against DVT post-hip surgery to continue for sixmonths minimal followed by orthopedic surgery.7. GI - The patient developed some diarrhea. C. diff. cultureswere negative to date at the time of discharge. The patient wasmaintained on Nexium prophylaxis in the setting of hisanticoagulation.8. Endocrine - The patient was restarted on oral hypoglycemicsprior to discharge in addition to sliding scale insulin. Thepatient had a Foley and a triple lumen catheter , both of which wereremoved on 6/18/02. The patient was evaluated by plastic surgeryfor his peripheral vascular disease with ulcers. Recommended drysterile dressings to the right and left foot wound changed q.d.with DuoDerm to the left lower leg wound to be changed q.3 days ,with pressure sore prevention.9. FEN - The patient was discharged on standing 20 mEq of K-Durq.d. It is likely to be checked q.o.d. to monitor for any furtherrequirements particularly in the setting of his runs ofnonsustained V-tach as noted above.10. Ortho - The patient is followed daily by orthopedic surgeryand was discharged with staples on his left lower extremities to bediscontinued per orthopedic surgery recommendations in the future.11. Disposition - The patient was stable for discharge to rehab on7/28/02. He was to follow up with his primary care physician ,orthopedic surgery , cardiology , and pulmonary medicine within thenext two weeks. His labs are to be drawn for a metabolic panel ,magnesium and calcium q.o.d. for as long as the primary carephysician feels it is necessary with repletion of his electrolytesas needed. He is to have physical therapy performed as needed.His weightbearing status is non-weightbearing on the left lowerextremity and weightbearing as tolerated on his right lowerextremity per orthopedic surgery at the time of discharge.DISCHARGE DIET: ADA diet , low fat , low cholesterol , low salt.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , hold forsystolic blood pressure less than 100 or heart rate less than 55 ,lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , hold for systolic blood pressure lessthan 100 , Lasix 100 mg p.o. q.d. , Lovenox 60 mg subcu. b.i.d. x6months , glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , sliding scale insulin , Nexium20 mg p.o. q.d. , Silvadene wet-to-dry dressing , please appy drysterile dressing to right and left foot wound to change q.d.

He had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction at this timeand in 1988 , he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction and asubsequent coronary artery bypass graft times three. In 1991 , hesustained an inferoposterior myocardial infarction and persantinethallium study demonstrated a fixed inferolateral defect. He waswell maintained on beta blockers and aspirin until September 1992.At this time , he developed symptoms consistent with unstableangina. He was ruled out for myocardial infarction at this time.An echo was significant for hypokinesis of the inferior andposterior walls and ejection fraction was noted to be 50%.Persantine thallium in September 1995 demonstrated posterobasilardefect with 60% redistribution. After this episode , he had againbeen symptom free. On 9/13/95 , the patient began experiencingsubsternal chest pressure , 10/10 , with radiation to the left armwith good response to sublingual nitroglycerin with total episodetime of five minutes. On 11/23/95 , he had a similar episode forapproximately two minutes which he rated as a 7/10. On the day ofadmission , the patient had a fifty minute 10/10 episode ofsubsternal chest pressure associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea.EKG was significant only for non-specific low T waves. Patient washeparinized , provided with beta blockers , and given aspirin andnitrates. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and theplan was to do a persantine thallium. The patient continued tohave pain of the chest at rest and was transferred to the Caus Memorial Hospital for further evaluation and cardiaccatheterization.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above as well as significant for poliowith subsequent muscle weakness of the lefthip and leg.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission were notable for Lopressor 50 mgq.6h. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,nitroglycerin intravenous infusion 20 micrograms per minute , andHeparin 1300 units per hour.ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs on admission were notable for ablood pressure of 112-116/64-84 with a heartrate of 53-75 , extraocular movements were intact , there was nojugular venous distention , carotids were 2+ bilaterally , lungs wereclear to auscultation , and cardiac examination showed the point ofmaximal intensity was non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm ,normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , no gallops , and no rubs. Abdomen wassoft , non-tender , and non-distended with no hepatosplenomegaly ,extremities showed no cyanosis and no edema , femoral pulses were 2+bilaterally without bruit , and pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a hematocritof 40.3 , a white count of 10.8 , potassiumof 3.7 , PT and PTT of 12.7 and 55 with an INR of 1.1 , andcholesterol was noted to be 287.HOSPITAL COURSE: While here , Mr. Mollema had one episode of 10/10substernal chest pressure not associated withdiaphoresis , nausea , or vomiting and relieved with sublingualnitroglycerin. EKG with pain as compared to old EKG demonstratedinversion of T waves in V1 through V3 and questionable inversionsin III and F. These inversions were present on a 11/28/95 EKG butnot on a 6/25/95 EKG. The EKG changes with the past medicalhistory was most likely significant of ongoing instability of thepatient's anginal symptoms and ischemic heart disease. At thistime , the plan was for cardiac catheterization. This is a 57 yearold male with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in thepast status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1988admitted with unstable angina and recurrent chest pain at rest.Aspirin , Heparin , nitrates , and beta blockers were continued.Cardiac catheterization results were notable for three vesseldisease but the bypass grafts , the LIMA to the left anteriordescending , was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the proximaldescending artery was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the ramuswas occluded , and the left circumflex to the saphenous vein graftto the ramus may be the culprit lesion contributing to thepatient's pain and EKG changes. The patient was continued onHeparin overnight post-catheterization and it was deemedappropriate to PTCA the ramus lesion. The patient was taken to theCatheterization Laboratory on 1/11/95 for successful PTCA of theramus occlusion. Post-procedure , the patient was stable and chestpain free. Post-catheterization , the patient was afebrile with ablood pressure of 106/68 and a pulse of 64. The right femoralcatheter site was without hematoma , no bruits , and femoral pulseswere 2+. Dorsalis pedis pulses were intact bilaterally and therewas no cyanosis. The patient was enrolled on the AMH protocol asper Dr. Androsky and as such , received 36 hours of intravenousprotocol therapy post-catheterization. The right groin sheathswere removed without difficulty , hematocrit at this time was 35.7 ,and the patient remained in stable condition with complaint ofchest pain. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospitalday. Physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of130/80 , a pulse of 65 , respiratory rate of 20 , temperature of 99.4 ,O2 saturations of 93 and 94% , and examination was within normallimits. Cardiac examination showed the point of maximal intensitynon-displaced , regular rate and rhythm , and no murmurs , gallops , orrubs.DISPOSITION: The patient is stable upon discharge and symptomfree.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. andLopressor 50 mg p.o. four times a day.FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Quincy Noble Aldo Zeyadeh atVere HospitalDictated By: JOAQUIN R.

She wastransferred from the C A Hospital to the Ersullcy Medical CenterHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old lady withdiabetes and known coronary artery disease status post CABG andstatus post multiple PCIs. She was in her usual state of healthuntil three weeks ago when she began with classical paroxysmalnocturnal dyspnea. She was taken to Ordland University Of Medical Center onthree different occasions in the past three weeks prior toadmission , where she was treated for pulmonary edema. Prior toher admission to the I.marg Healthcare , she had had atroponin leak of up to 3.6. This was on the 5 of July . She also was admitted with acute renal failure. Hercreatinine on the 15 of June per note was 1.1. When weadmitted her creatinine was 2.6. This was likely secondary tothe fact that she had received amikacin for urinary tractinfection at the Tawno Health and she had also had achest , abdominal , and pelvis contrast CT leading to contrastnephropathy. When she was admitted , her main problems were thefollowing: She had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.She was a high-risk patient with a TIMI score of 5. She hadacute renal failure probably secondary to a number of factorsincluding contrast dye what she had received at the outsidehospital and amikacin which she had received for urinary tractinfection. Her other problem was she had a urinary tractinfection per report secondary to E. Coli resistant to Levaquinand gentamicin.Her past medical history was relevant for the following:She had diabetes type 2 with chronic renal insufficiencysecondary to the diabetes. She has anxiety disorder. She hadcoronary artery disease status post CABG in 1992. She is statuspost PCI with a stent placed in 2002 , and 2004 apparently. Shealso had congestive heart failure with an EF per an echoperformed at Burg Man'stard Memorial Hospital was 35%. She had GERD andBarrett's esophagus. She had hypertension andhypercholesterolemia. She had had a pacemaker placed. She hadhemorrhoids. She had osteoarthritis with both knees. She hadspinal stenosis and chronic back pain status post cholecystectomyand a history of asthma.Her allergies included the following: Bactrim , penicillin ,erythromycin , Keflex , Metformin , clindamycin , and ciprofloxacin.Her social history , she was in a nursing facility. She isdivorced. She has four kinds. Lives in Gle and is oftenvisited by her children.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her temperature was 96 , herpulse 77 , her blood pressure was 170/95 , although admittedly itwas difficult taking her blood pressure by auscultation. Thiswas measured by palpation and confirmed by Doppler. She wassatting 96% on 3.5 L via nasal cannula. She is alert andoriented x3 in no acute distress. She had arcus senilis. Herextraocular movements are intact. She had pupils equal , round ,and reactive to light. Her chest showed bibasilar crackles/ralestwo-thirds way up. Her JVP is 10 cm water. Her heart had aregular rate and rhythm with no gallop. No rubs or murmursheard. Her abdomen is benign. Her extremities are warm with noedema and she is grossly neurologically intact.Her first set of labs at the Ha Ottejaquesrence Hospitalrevealed the following: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 ,CO2 24 , BUN 40 , creatinine 2.5 , glucose 95 , white blood cellcount of 10.16 , a hemoglobin of 10.0 , platelets 232 , INR 1.5.Her BNP was 2138. Her lipase was 7. Her troponin level was0.75.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:Non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction. On presentation ,the patient had several EKG changes consistent with an acutecoronary syndrome. She was in normal sinus rhythm with T waveflattening or inversion in leads V4 to V6 and in the inferiorleads also 2 , 3 , aVF. She had Q-S complexes in V1 through V3.She was deemed to be a high-risk patient for the TIMI score of5and they documented troponin leak. She was managed medically ,not interventionally given her acute renal failure. She wastreated with unfractionated heparin with a PTT level of 50 to 70seconds. She was given aspirin , Plavix. She was also giveneptifibatide intravenously for five days and is also treated withbeta blockers and ACE inhibitor. After five days , she had norecurrent chest pain. Her EKG changes were persistent but hertroponin levels have trended downwards and she has really beenasymptomatic in this regard. Regarding her pulmonary edema , wetreated with Lasix initially 40 mg IV Lasix x1 and then onstanding PO Lasix 40 mg daily , and diuresed her and also gave hermorphine and oxygen. Within four or five days , her physicalexamination was much better and her crackles and rales hadmarkedly decreased. On admission , she was saturating 96% on 3.5L. She progressed. Her oxygen requirements decreased. She wasdiuresed and was finally weaned off oxygen and is currentlysaturating 97% on room air. The plan is for her to continue onaspirin , Plavix , high-dose Lipitor , and beta-blocker , andnitrates as needed.2. In terms of her acute renal failure , based on the recordsfrom the Trickvan Agi Health Network , her creatinine had jumped from1.1 to 2.5 in three days. This was felt to be most likely due tointrinsic renal failure. She did not have a low urine output andshe had received amikacin in the past few days prior to admissionas well as contrast dye and she did have a history of contrastdye induced nephropathy leading to a predialysis state , althoughshe did not get dialysis on that occasion. Here , we simplyavoided nephrotoxic agents , were judicious in the use of Lasixwith strict ??____?? controls , and her creatinine gradually beganto decrease and today it is down to 1.6. Infectious Diseasewise , she came with the documented urinary tract infectionreported to be due to E. coli resistant to levofloxacin andgentamicin. Here , we cultured her again and found E. coli morethan a 100 , 000 colonies , which was resistant to ampicillin ,gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , and levofloxacin. It was sensitive toceftazidime and she therefore received renally dosed ceftazidimefor her UTI to complete a 7 to 10-day course. Blood culturesdrawn on the 24 of April showed no growth to date. Thepatient has also been afebrile in with a white blood cell countbetween 7 and 11 , 000. In terms of her hypertension , of note , ithas been difficult to measure her blood pressure , probablymeasuring her blood pressure in her left arm by palpation is amost reliable way to do this. She was treated here withhydralazine , Lopressor , and diuretics. On discharge , she feelswell. Today , she told me that she has not filled this for a longtime. She had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath.She is afebrile with a temperature of 98. Her pulse rangesbetween 60 and 70. Her blood pressure is between 102 and 150systolic and she is satting 95% on room air. Her current weightis 73 kg and she is deemed to be euvolemic so this should be hertarget weight and she is ambulating with assistance. She isalert and oriented x3 in no acute distress. She has got pupilsequal , round , and reactive to light. She has only a fewbibasilar crackles on bases. Otherwise , her lungs are clear.Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm with no gallops , rubs , ormurmurs. Her abdomen is benign. Her extremities are warm. Herright calf is quite tender to palpation. She has a documentedold DVT in her gastrocnemius vein. This is old and she hasprobably got some postphlebitic syndrome and should be followed.She is neurologically grossly intact.Her laboratories at discharge include the following:Sodium 139 , potassium 4.7 , her creatinine is 1.6 , BUN is 50 , herwhite blood cell count is 11.01 , hematocrit 28.5 , hemoglobin 9.2 ,and platelets 258 with an INR of 1.2.Her medications at discharge include the following:1. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg orally daily.2. Ceftazidime 1 g IV q.24h. until August to complete a7-day course.3. Colace 100 mg orally twice a day in case of constipation.4. Lasix 40 mg orally every 12 hours.5. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously three times a day , whilethe patient is bedridden.6. Isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg orally three times a day.7. Lopressor 37.5 mg orally three times a day with holdparameters , hold if systolic blood pressure is less than 110 , ora heart rate is less than 55.8. Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.9. Vicodin one tablet every six hours in case of pain.10. Risperidone 0.5 mg orally once a day.11. Lipitor 80 mg orally once a day.12. Plavix 75 mg orally once a day.13. Celexa 20 mg orally once a day.14. Esomeprazole 20 mg orally once a day.15. Lantus 17 units subcutaneously every morning.16. Novolog sliding scale.DISPOSITION AND PLAN: The patient is to go to rehabilitation.Things to do specifically include the following:She should be diuresed with Lasix as needed to achieve a dryweight goal of 72 kg. She should continue on ceftazidime for herurinary tract infection until August and her calf pain -DVT should be followed , one possibly to raise the Clevewill Ent Hospital as this may represent in a cold malignancy , for which shemay need to be worked up once the acute setting is over.Studies performed at this hospital include the following:A renal ultrasound as part of her workup for acute renal failurereveal a right kidney with a size of 11.8 cm and apical corticalcyst , left kidney 10.6 cm , and no hydronephrosis. The patientalso had a MIBI , SPECT of her heart , which revealed thefollowing:The combined ??____?? ischemia plus scar during the stress weremoderately abnormal with a summed stress score of 9. Her rest LVejection fraction was 50%. The patient's PET CT test resultswere normal and consistent with a small region of myocardialischemia in the septal area and also a focus of ischemia in theOM territory. She had abnormal global LV systolic function andthese results demonstrated in interval progressing per her priorstudy performed on November , 2004.eScription document: 8-9628375 ISSten TelCC: Beau Yong Mccarron MDIne Spodes LandSa HisonCC: Bernard ThormahlenTua Health ServicesSgrove Noville ReveThouleighrocksamontotte Hunt UDictated By: LIDTKE , WESTON EMMANUEL BOBAttending: CASELLO , RUDY MONTYDictation ID 0452748D: 9/19/05T: 9/19/05

Thepatient noted that the shortness of breath was often brought on byheroin use ( He has not used cocaine for several years. His lastheroin use was the day prior to admission. ). His shortness ofbreath was "off and on , " worse with exertion. It was notnecessarily worse when lying flat. He has had this shortness ofbreath for several months , although as mentioned , was worse in theweeks prior to admission. His chest pain was hard for him todescribe , although , he did mention that it was not heavy incharacter. He admitted to some chest discomfort when he becameexcited or agitated. He also described his chest pain as sharp.There was no nausea. He did complain of some dizziness. His paindid not radiate to the neck or arms and was different fromheartburn pain. Of note , the patient has not taken his outpatientmedications for the last six months and admits to dietnoncompliance with salty foods. The patient's last heroin use , asmentioned , was the day prior to admission. In the past , he hasnoticed that he cannot go more than two days without symptoms ofwithdrawal.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for constipation for which he takeslaxatives. There is no abdominal pain.Occasional headache. No change in vision. No dysuria.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Remarkable for IV drug abuse - heroincurrently , cocaine in the past.2. Hypertension times many years. 3. Gout. 4. Left ventricularhypertrophy.MEDICATIONS: The patient has taken no medications for six months.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Ver La A with hisbrother and his sister. He is on disability since1992. He smokes one pack every 3 days. He rarely uses alcohol.He does use IV drugs as mentioned.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 97.3 , heart rate 95. Uponpresentation to the emergency room , hisblood pressure was 190/110 , respiratory rate 24 , O2 sat 100% on twoliters. GENERAL: The patient was seated and in no acute distress.HEENT: Conjunctiva was slightly pink but nonicteric. Extraocularmuscles are intact. Pupils are equal , round , and reactive tolight. He had poor dentition. His JVP was 7 cm. LUNGS: Clear toauscultation on the left. On the right there were some cracklesmidway up the lung field. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with anormal S1 , S2. There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.ABDOMEN: Markedly hypoactive bowel sounds. His belly was soft andobese , nontender. There were no obvious masses. EXTREMITIES: Thepatient had 2+ pulses. There was no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.NEUROLOGIC: The patient was alert and oriented x 3. Neural examwas otherwise nonfocal.ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 141 , potassium 3.4 , chloride106 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN 21 , creatinine2.1 , glucose 107 , calcium 8.4. CK was 158 with an MB of 2.2 ,troponin was 0.12. Toxicology screen was negative. Urinetoxicology was positive for opiates. Urinalysis was remarkable for1+ blood and 3+ protein. CBC white count was 6.9 , hematocrit 45.7 ,platelets 301 , 000. PT was 13.2 , PTT 32.6 , INR 1.0.Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with a right pleural effusion and aright middle lobe pneumonia. EKG on arrival to the emergency roomshowed an irregular ventricular rate at 156 which was likely atrialfibrillation vs flutter. There was a normal axis. There wereT wave inversions in the inferior leads as well as V5 and V6. TheEKG was then repeated after the patient had received diltiazemwhich showed sinus rhythm at 86. There were still T waveinversions in AVL and V6. There was borderline first-degree AVblock. There was LVH and T waves were flat inferiorly.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular - ischemia. Thepatient ruled out for MI by CKs buthad a troponin which peaked at 0.12. This was thought to be raterelated. Blood pressure control was established with verapamil( The patient had severe bronchospasms to Lopressor and it wasunclear whether it was cardiac asthma or real bronchospasticreaction. ) , clonidine , and losartan. ( The patient had cough anddesaturation to captopril. ) Aspirin was given. A lipid panel waschecked and showed a total cholesterol of 188 , LDL 130 , HDL 56 andtriglycerides of 63. The patient was initially continued onsimvastatin. Because of the worry of CHF , ( History of low EF ,possible orthopnea ) an echocardiogram was performed which showedLVEF only 25% with global hypokinesis and inferior/posteriorakinesis. The etiology of his heart failure was unclear as he hadnever had a known myocardial infarction in the past. A chemicalstress test was performed on June , 2003 , and showed noreversible defect but a large inferior scar. The patient wassubsequently taken to cardiac catheterization to determine whetherhe had coronary artery disease. There was no coronary arterydisease on left heart cath. Right heart cath showed an elevatedpulmonary capillary wedge pressure close to 30 and a central venouspressure of 18. His cardiomyopathy was not shown to be ischemic inorigin. There was no indication seen for AICD placement. However ,for the elevated central pressures , the patient was aggressivelydiuresed with IV Lasix which was then changed to p.o. torsemide.Aspirin and simvastatin were discontinued given lack of coronaryartery disease for the sake of simplifying his medical regimen inorder to optimize the chance of medical compliance.2. Pulmonary. The patient was given levofloxacin forcommunity-acquired pneumonia and improved. On the evening ofadmission , he had a severe bronchospastic reaction to Lopressor sothis was discontinued. He received nebulizers around the clock forrecurrent wheeze and cough. It was noted that the onset of hiscough was after his captopril dosing. For this reason , captoprilwas discontinued and changed to losartan which he tolerated welland with resolution of his cough.3. Renal. The patient's creatinine was noted to be up to themid-2s from a baseline in the mid-1s. Potential etiologies onadmission where thought to be hypertension , gout , heroin use or alow flow during his cardiac arrhythmia on presentation. A phenolwas calculated and was shown to be less than 1%. A 24-hour proteinwas performed and showed over 3 gm of protein. The most likelycause of this proteinuria was thought to be CHF , although , thepatient should have renal follow up. The patient refused Mucomystin anticipation of his cardiac catheterization. He underwent arenal ultrasound which showed increased echogenicity of bothkidneys which was consistent with medical renal disease. There wasno hydronephrosis seen. There were bilateral renal cysts and aright renal calculus. The patient will be seen in follow up withDr. Doles of renal.4. Heroin addiction. The LCMC team was consulted for heroinaddiction. Methadone was given and was tapered to off during hisadmission.5. Other. Allopurinol was given for his history of gout.6. Prophylaxis. The patient was kept on subcu heparin.The patient will follow up with Dr. Boddorf , his primary caredoctor , on Tuesday , August , 2003 , at 8:00 AM and withDr. Dunegan of renal on August , 2003 , at 1:30 PM.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Allopurinol 200 mg p.o. q day , losartan100 mg p.o. q day , albuterol inhaler twopuffs q.i.d. p.r.n. wheeze , amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q day andtorsemide 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.Dictated By: GROVER PREFONTAINE , M.D. PI36Attending: JUDE PETTER , M.D. TZ64YA777/064994Batch: 34715 Index No. IZOY2Z3RMR D: 9/8/03T: 9/8/03CC: 1.

Ms. Debrecht 's pertinent medical history was significantfor longstanding peripheral vascular disease and coronary arterydisease. In early 1992 , she first noted the onset of exertionalchest discomfort. Symptoms progressed and an exercise tolerancetest was performed in 1/4 which was standard Bruce protocol atsix minutes and thirty seconds with a maximal heart rate of 160 andmaximal blood pressure of 144 stopping secondary to 2 to 2.5 mm STdepression inferolaterally. Cardiac catheterization in 6/9revealed left anterior descending of 80 to 90% and mid rightcoronary artery 99% ( with left-to-right and right-to-rightcollaterals ). The right coronary artery lesion was PTCA to a 20%residual which re-occluded and was re-PTCA to a 20% thenre-occluded again ( no PTCA a third time ). Echo in 6/9 revealedan ejection fraction of 50% , inferior hypokinesis consistent withprior myocardial infarction , and mild MVP/MR was also seen.Coronary artery bypass graft times two vessels ( LIMA to leftanterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the proximaldescending artery ) was performed in 6/9 ( Dr. Nethery ). Sincethen , she had done well with no further chest pain. Startingapproximately one month prior to admission , the patient began toexperience episodes of near syncope. Episodes consisted of thesensation of light headedness , tunnel vision , tinnitus , anddiaphoresis ( although she felt near-syncopal , she had neveractually experienced true syncope ). During episodes , shefrequently felt the sensation of facial flushing with diaphoresis.She could not recall precipitating events prior to the episodes butdid note that the events never occurred when she was active , onlywhen she was at rest ( but not asleep ). Holter monitor on September , 1996 revealed multiple three to four second pauses. Thepatient's anti-hypertensive , metoprolol ( 25 mg b.i.d. ) wasdiscontinued , however , repeat Holter on 10/9/96 revealed multiplepauses ( 114 pauses in a 24-hour period ) with the longest lasting4.2 seconds. The patient was then sent to the Sa Ratee for further evaluation and management.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As described in Secondary Diagnoses above.SOCIAL HISTORY: Divorced , retired x-ray technician , former smokerof one pack per day times thirty years quittingeleven years ago , and history of ethanol consumption at the time ofdivorce. Her primary medical doctor was Dr. Armand Shackelford( Huban ).FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 76and history of hypercholesterolemia , mother diedat age 86 of gastrointestinal ulceration and had a history ofinsulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and sister with non-insulindependent diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal ulcers.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.b.i.d. ( discontinued three weeks ago ) ,vitamin supplements ( vitamin E , lysine , Co-Q10 , vitamin C , calcium ,Centrum Silver , and primrose oil ) , and no over-the-countermedications.ALLERGIES: Penicillin , Zantac , and Comtrex , all of which produceangioedema and tetracycline ( sun sensitivity ).PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs showed a blood pressure of160/110 , pulse 92 , temperature 97.0 ,respirations 16 , and 97% on room air. GENERAL: Energetic whitefemale in no apparent distress. HEENT: Extraocular movementsintact , pupils equally round and reactive to light , oropharynxwithout erythema or exudate , and no cervical lymphadenopathy orthyromegaly. NECK: Supple and carotids 2+ bilaterally withoutbruits. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm at 72 with norubs , gallops , or murmurs. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation andpercussion. ABDOMEN: Obese with cholecystectomy scar , chest tubescars , and bowel surgery scar ( right just lateral of the midline ) ,normal bowel sounds times four , non-tender , non-distended , nohepatosplenomegaly , and no bruits. EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis ,clubbing , or edema , femoral pulses were barely palpable , and distalpulses were 1+ bilaterally on the right and left lower extremity.NEUROLOGICAL: Alert and oriented times three , cranial nervesII-XII intact , strength 5/5 , sensory intact , deep tendon reflexes3+ bilaterally throughout , and toes downgoing.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was remarkable for a potassium of3.9 , BUN 14 , creatinine 0.7 , liverfunction tests within normal limits , white blood count equalled7.8 , hematocrit equalled 41 , and platelets were 233. PT was 12.3( 1.1 ) and PTT equalled 30.4. Chest x-ray showed status postcoronary artery bypass graft and bibasilar atelectasis but no acuteair space disease and EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 79 withan axis of 60 degrees , T wave inversion in V2 to V3 with upright inV4 and V6 , and Q waves in II , III , and F.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 61 year old female with peripheralvascular disease and coronary artery diseasestatus post coronary artery bypass graft now admitted forevaluation and management of near syncope. Holter monitor haddemonstrated persistence of sinus pauses despite discontinuation ofbeta blocker ( metoprolol ). The patient was admitted forobservation over the weekend. She experienced multiple sinuspauses , particularly at nighttime. The longest pause recorded was4.7 seconds. Though she was aware of the irregular heart rhythm ,she never became truly syncopal or had evidence of hemodynamicinstability. She was enrolled in the ECTH trial and underwentplacement of a dual chamber pacemaker randomized to the VVIR mode on9/10/96. She tolerated the procedure without complication. Post-operativechest x-ray revealed appropriate location of atrial and ventricular leads andno evidence of pneumothorax. Interrogation of the pacemakerrevealed appropriate response. The patient did well overnight andwas discharged on May , 1996 with instructions to follow-upwith Dr. Passarella in ten days.DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged on May , 1996 in goodcondition.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. and Percocet one totwo tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.FOLLOW-UP: She was instructed to follow-up with Dr. Lafranca onAugust , 1996 at 1 p.m.Dictated By: CHAUNCEY J.

She was discharged to home on 5/4/97 toDiand Leb Hospital Hospital And Hospital where she developedepigastric discomfort and recurrent atrial fibrillation and wastransferred back to Landso Souwalt Medical Center .Her cardiac history dates back to October of 1995 when she wasadmitted to Kassi Rehabilitation Hospital for an asthma flare. At thattime she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Her CKs werenegative. An exercise test at that time showed she was able to goeight minutes on a Bruce protocol with 2 mm ST depressions in leads2 , 3 , and F. A MIBI showed a small reversible defect inferiorlyand she was managed medically at that time.In February of 1996 she was again admitted to Lita Hospital with chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardialinfarction. She was started on Prilosec for presumedgastroesophageal reflux disease. In September of 1996 an exerciseThallium test showed she went eight minutes on a Bruce protocolwith a heart rate of 125 , blood pressure 170/80 , and no ECGchanges. She stopped secondary to chest pain.From 3/30/97 through 3/5/97 she presented with chest pressure atrest which radiated to her shoulders and jaw. On presentation shewas noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation. An ECG at that timeshowed elevated T-waves in V1 and V2. She was treated withLopressor with slowing of the rate and relief of her chest pain.She ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 473 withan MB fraction of 32. Her Lopressor was changed to Verapamilsecondary to increased wheezing requiring nebulizers. The patientunderwent a cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealedan left anterior descending artery that had 70% proximal lesionwith collaterals , left circumflex artery with long 80 to 90%stenosis , right coronary artery 30 to 40% stenosis , left ventriclewith ejection fraction of 58% , and apical akinesis. Shespontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm. Followingcatheterization the patient agreed to a coronary artery bypassgraft but the procedure was postponed until she received Epogentherapy since she is a Jehovah's Witness. She was discharged insinus rhythm.She returned on 10/17/97 and underwent a coronary artery bypassgraft times two which was complicated by a perioperative myocardialinfarction with inferior ST elevations and peak CK of 386 and MBfraction of 8.1. Atrial fibrillation was not controlled withVerapamil. The patient was loaded on Digoxin and had multipleepisodes of atrial fibrillation. She converted to normal sinusrhythm and was discharged to rehabilitation on 5/4/97 in normalsinus rhythm.Her postoperative course was notable for gastrointestinal distresswith epigastric burning , reflux , nausea , vomiting , andconstipation. On 5/4/97 at rehabilitation the patient notedworsening epigastric burning with a sour taste in her mouth. Thiswas relieved with Maalox. She was awakened from sleep withepigastric burning radiating to the right back and palpitations.ECG showed rapid atrial fibrillation at a rate of 125 to 150 andshe was treated with Verapamil 2.5 mg IV times two and converted tonormal sinus rhythm. The patient was noted to have ST elevationsof 1 mm in 1 , 3 , and F and she was transferred to Yacull Hospital for further evaluation. She had no complaint of shortnessof breath , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , syncope , orpresyncope. At Vero Medical Center she was noted to haveepigastric burning similar to a prior episode and was treated withMaalox with relief.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was lying in bed in no apparentdistress. HEENT: Normocephalic ,atraumatic. Pupils equal , round , and reactive to light andaccommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx benign.Neck: Supple. Full range of motion. No lymphadenopathy.Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP 8 cm. Heart: No heave and nothrill. Regular rate. S1 , split S2. 2/6 systolic murmur at apex.Positive for frictional rub. Lungs clear to auscultation. Nowheeze or rhonchi. Chest had midline sternotomy without anyexudate or erythema. Sternum was stable. Back: No costovertebralangle tenderness. Abdomen: Keloid in right upper quadrant. Soft ,nontender , nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: Noclubbing , cyanosis , or edema. Neurologic: Alert and orientedtimes three. Cranial nerves II - XII intact. Intact sensation andstrength throughout. Reflexes symmetric and toes downgoing.LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 129 , potassium 5.4 , creatinine 1.0 , BUN20 , glucose 227. Digoxin level 2.6. Hematocrit45.1 , WBC 9.2. Her triponin-1 level was 0.7. ECG at Aifield Sum Taning Healthcare Center was in normal sinus rhythm. Normal left axis ,normal intervals. 0.16 , 0.88 , 0.36. Rate of 85. Left atrialenlargement. 1 mm ST depressions in 1 and 2 which is consistentwith Digoxin effect. 1 mm upsloping ST elevations in 2 , 3 , and Funchanged from prior ECG on 8/28/97. Chest x-ray showed mediastinalshadow. Stable with question of atelectasis at left base.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarctionand her chest burning was primarily due togastrointestinal reflux which was relieved with Maalox , as well aschest discomfort in her left shoulder which was due tomusculoskeletal pain and was relieved with Tylenol and Percocet orDarvocet. On monitor she showed no evidence of atrial fibrillationalthough she did have supraventricular tachycardia and one incidentof a ten-beat run. In light of the fact that the patient is aJehovah's Witness and is not a candidate for being Coumadinized forepisodes of rapid atrial fibrillation , it was felt that we woulduse the anti-arrhythmic agent , Propafenone , to prevent episodes inthe perioperative period of atrial fibrillation. Her Digoxin wasdiscontinued and she tolerated Propafenone load of 150 mg t.i.d.well along with her Verapamil dose.Other issues during this admission were that her blood sugar washigh requiring sliding scale of insulin. Also the patient hadhyponatremia with sodium in the high 120s and low 130s throughouther stay , as well as a potassium which was mildly elevated , rangingfrom 5.0 to 5.8. Cortisol levels were drawn and results arepending for possibility of adrenal insufficiency. The question ofa renal tubular acidosis type IV was raised.Throughout the admission her chest burning was well controlled withMaalox. Her Pepcid dose was increased to 20 mg b.i.d.Helicobacter pylori and IgG antibodies were sent and results arepending. Her musculoskeletal pain which is primarily in her leftshoulder radiating to her arm has been well controlled withTylenol.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary history as above ,asthma which has required hospitalization inthe past but no intubations , adult-onset diabetes mellitus forwhich she takes Micronase , hypertension , gastroesophageal refluxdisease , hypercholesterolemia , status post cholecystectomy , leftlower lobe granuloma followed by chest CT scan , and cataracts.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4h , Albuterol inhaler2 puffs q.i.d. , Ecasa 81 mg p.o. q.d. ,Beclovent 2 sprays t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Epogen 10 , 000units subcu three times a week , Gliburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Mevacor20 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Propafenone 150 mgp.o. t.i.d. , Verapamil SR 120 mg p.o. q.d.ALLERGIES: Beta blockers and Lisinopril.

Abdomen:Abdomen was with normal bowel sounds , was soft , obese andnon-tender with a hyperpigmented patch centrally. EXTREMITIES:Extremities are without edema or joint effusions. The left greattoe had hypertrophic toe nails , tender to palpation with an ingrowntoenail. Rectal was with guaiac positive stool. NEURO: Neuro examwas grossly non-focal. Skin had no new rashes.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admission data included a sodium of 144 ,a potassium of 4 , chloride of 107 , bicarbof 27 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.1 , glucose of 155. CK was 430with an MB fraction of 1.5 and as an aside , the patient is known tohave chronically elevated CKs. White count was 8.7 , hematocrit of36 with an MCV of 90 and 93 , 000 platelets. PT 13 , PTT 30. LFTswere within normal limits. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at95 beats per minute with intervals of .18 , .81 , .35 and axis of 21with Q waves in V1 , V2 , T wave flattening in V2. Chest x-ray waswithout infiltrates or effusions.HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course by system: The patient was ruledout for MI , had CKs of 430 with an MB fraction of1.544 with an MB fraction of 1.9 and 404 with an MB fraction of .8.There were no further EKG changes. The patient had no chest painwhile in the hospital. The patient's Lopressor was increased to75mg q.i.d. while in house and the patient also underwent adiagnostic cardiac catheterization with the following results: AnLAD without critical stenosis , an OMB1 with a 90% proximal stenosisand OMB2 with diffuse disease and serial lesions , an RCA with aproximal 90% stenosis and a distal 70% stenosis , and normalventricular function. The patient was offered PTCA of her criticallesions and the patient declined. As the patient had not beencompliant with her medical regimen , it was felt that we would sendher out on her increased dosage of Lopressor and monitor her levelof chest discomfort and perhaps re-offer her PTCA at a later date.The patient's toe was evaluated by podiatry who felt that she had ,in fact , an ingrown toenail which was treated via avulsion of themargin of the nail and a 4 day course of Cephradine 500mg p.o.q.i.d. The patient had all Ansaid held secondary to her guaiacpositive stool and her hematocrit monitored and it suggested thatthe patient have a GI workup as an outpatient. The patient hadanemia which was thought secondary to chronic GI bleed. Ironstudies performed while in house detected an iron level of 31 ,total iron binding capacity of 246 , a B12 of 904 , folate of 10.4 ,and a ferritin of 235; all not consistent with iron deficiencyanemia. The patient also presented with thrombocytopenia which wasthought perhaps secondary to Pepcid or Ansaid. These medicationswere held while she was in house and her platelet level remainedapproximately 100 and was so upon discharge.DISPOSITION: The patient continued her normal medical regimen forschizophrenia and was discharged in stable conditionon the following medicines: MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin325mg a day , Librium 10mg b.i.d. , NPH insulin 42 units sub qq.a.m. , Lopressor 100mg p.o. t.i.d. , verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d ,Prolixin Decanoate 12.5mg IM q o weekly and nitroglycerin 1/150 1tablet sublingual q 5 minutes x 3 p.r.n. chest pain. The patientwill have home health aid and VNA services to ensure morecompliance with medication regimen and diet , also to check fingerstick glucose every day , blood pressure every week and toadminister her Prolixin every week. The patient is recommended tobe on a 800 ADA diet and will have follow-up with Dr.in the CO Clinic.Dictated By: ED GOMMER , M.D. EV87Attending: NATHAN BOFFA , M.D. NU1BL782/5970Batch: 5821 Index No. M1COME1MJF D: 11/25/94T: 6/5/94

ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Trudell is a 69 year old womanwith a history of coronary arterydisease , status post an inferoposterior myocardial infarction inJanuary 1996. She had a cardiac catheterization at the time , whichshowed an 80% mid left anterior descending artery lesion , and 80%left circumflex lesion before OM1 , 50% proximal right coronaryartery lesion , and an 80% posterior left ventricular branch lesion.She was also noted to have inferior and anterolateral HK with anejection fraction of 52%. The patient expressed her desire to bemanaged conservatively , and was medically managed for the followingyear. She had a sub-max exercise tolerance test prior to dischargeand one month later had a full BRUCE protocol going six minuteswith less than 1 mm ST segment depressions in several leads. Thepatient did well for the past year without symptoms until 1:00 a.m.on the morning of admission when she woke from sleep withsubsternal chest pain. She took sublingual nitroglycerin withrelief after half and hour but at 3:00 a.m. the pain recurred withnausea. The patient took two sublingual nitroglycerin withresolution of the pain by 4:00 a.m. She presented to the emergencydepartment free of pain and electrocardiogram at the time showedchanges consistent with anterior ischemia. The patient wasadmitted with unstable angina for evaluation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for coronary artery disease ,hypertension , status post cholecystectomy.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include simvastatin 10 mg q.h.s. ,sublingual nitroglycerin , enalapril5 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pulse of 62 , regular and bloodpressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 12 , oxygensaturation of 99% on three liters nasal cannula.

BUN 20 , creatinine 1.4 ,glucose 377 , LDH 220. Sputum revealed 4+ polys , 4+ epithelialcells , gram negative and gram positive cocci. Chest x-ray revealedno evidence of congestive heart failure and no infiltrates.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 69 year-old woman with a history ofcongestive heart failure and hypertension whopresented with a productive cough which was worsening over the past3-4 days and fever to 101 with chills and shakes and increasingshortness of breath. She was afebrile however at the time ofadmission. Her exam was remarkable for diffuse rhonchi andmoderate jugular venous distention. She had a white blood cellcount of 9.3 with 54% polys and 9.6 % eosinophils. Blood glucoseof 377 and a chest x-ray without evidence of congestive heartfailure or infiltrate. She was treated in the emergency room withAlbuterol nebulizer and plans were to discharge her to home ,however , her saturations dropped to 89% on room air with exercisein the emergency room and was admitted for further observation.She was started on intravenous Cefuroxime , and initially improvedwith decrease in cough and shortness of breath however , the patientcontinued to desat with exercise. A repeat chest x-ray wasperformed which showed no change when compared to the admissionfilm. Her sputum culture grew out Pen-sensitive E-coli and she wascontinued on her intravenous and then PO antibiotics. Shecontinued to desat with exercise , however , and her cough persistedalthough she remained afebrile with a slightly elevated white countand moderate peripheral eosinophilia. Her chest exam remainedrancorous and the reason for this remained unclear. Given thefinding of E-coli in the sputum sample , in addition to the elevatedeosinophilia and lack of finding on chest x-ray despite significantfindings on chest exam , the possibility of a worm or parasiticdisease was raised. The patient is from Pa but had not beenthere in 8 years. She did have a history of diarrhea for severalweeks a few months prior to this admission. Stool specimen wassent but was rejected by the laboratory and the patient was unableto produce another stool specimen before discharge. The patientwas discharged to home with Albuterol inhaler and instructions tofollow up with her primary physician. In addition , plans were madefor her to have PFTs done as an outpatient and plan for chest CT ifher symptoms continued without other etiology being discovered.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg poq day. 2 ) Cefuroxime 500 mg PO b.i.d.3 ) Premarin 0.625 mg PO q day. 4 ) Lasix 40 mg PO q day. 5 )Tofranil 75 mg PO q HS. 6 ) Zestril 20 mg PO b.i.d. 7 ) VerapamilSR 120 mg PO b.i.d. 8 ) Insulin 70/30 28 units q a.m. and 5 unitsq p.m. subcue. 9 ) Potassium slow release 10 mEq PO q day. 10 )Albuterol inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d.DISPOSITION: At the time of discharge the patient's saturation was92 to 93% on room air and dropping slightly to 90 to91% with exercise , however she was tolerating this well and wasgetting relief from her Albuterol inhaler. She was to finish afull ten day course of antibiotics for presumed bronchitis and tofollow up with her primary physician in clinic for furtherevaluation including PFTs and possible chest CT if symptoms did notabate.Dictated By: RICKEY HAWS , M.D. BT34Attending: ANDREA E.

She was in her usual state ofhealth until returning from the bathroom at 1 a.m. on the day ofadmission when she felt weak. She describes the sensation as ifshe was going to die. She had a burning sensation in her midsternum and upper abdominal pain and also felt lightheaded. Thepatient describes the pain is worse when lying flat andassociated with mild shortness of breath and intermittent nauseawithout vomiting. She denies radiation of the pain.Of note , the patient has had many recent HTN episodes in thew/associated lightheadednessprompting many visits to the Caea Hospital Emergency Room. She was admitted about one to two weeks ago tothe Bayi for similar complaints with hypertensiveurgency. Her blood pressure medications were adjusted. She hada negative cardiac workup.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies cough , cold symptoms ,fevers , chills , weight changes , changes in vision , numbness ,diarrhea , melena or urinary symptoms.

She lives with her son. She has four childrenwho are alive and well and living in the area. She has a remotesmoking history. She denies alcohol or illicit drug use.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is afebrile. Heart rate 59 ,blood pressure 136/58 , respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation100% on 2 liters. In general , the patient describes as elderlylying supine in bed , resting comfortably. She is awake , speakingin full sentences without difficulty. She is in no acuterespiratory distress. HEENT , normocephalic and atraumatic ,anicteric sclerae , mucous membranes are moist. Neck is supplewithout lymphadenopathy. JVP was approximately 7-8 cm. Chest ,she had bibasilar fine rales with fair aeration throughout. Norhonchi or wheezes. Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , S1and S2 with bradycardic rate at 48 beats per minute. Abdomen hasmany old healed scars , no rashes , bowel sounds are positive. Sheis soft , nondistended , nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.Extremities are warm and well perfused. No clubbing , cyanosis oredema. A 2+ dorsalis pedal pulses. Skin is intact without rash.Neuro , cranial nerves II to XII intact with no focal deficits.She is alert and oriented x3. Vascular , she has bilateralfemoral bruits which were audible with stethoscope.ADMISSION LABS: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 108 , CO2 23 ,anion gap of 9 , calcium 9 , magnesium 1.8 , total bilirubin 0.7 ,BNP 165 , cardiac enzymes were not elevated , white count 6.91 ,hematocrit 35.9 , platelets 227. Urinalysis was within normallimits. PT 12.1 , PTT 43.2 , INR 1.0. A portable chest x-ray waswithout any evidence of acute pulmonary process. EKG with sinusbradycardia with rate of 55 with T-wave inversions in leads V5and V6 , leads 1 , 2 and AVF. All present on prior EKG. Therewere no acute ST changes.EMERGENCY ROOM COURSE: Systolic blood pressure was in 190s. Shereceived aspirin x1 , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. x1 , Lopressor 5 mg IVx1 , and blood pressure went down to 170s prior to her transfer tothe floor.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular:Ischemia: The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes.Her EKG was abnormal , but unchanged from 1/28 She continued on aspirin ,Plavix andLipitor. Fasting lipids did not indicate need for change instatin treatment. On 3/1 , the patient had a recurrence ofher chest pain symptoms in the setting of her only hypertensiveevent during this admission. Her EKG was notable for new flippedTs in leads V3 and V4 ( which happened to be seen previouslyduring this admission when she had atrial fibrillation with rapidventricular response on 6/3 ). The medical team suspectshypertensive-induced microvascular angina. A repeat rule out MIhas been re-initiated and is currently in progress at the time ofthis dictation. A&B set enzymes were negative.Pump: Echocardiogram at the Dallnorm Community Hospital on 10/6revealed normal left ventricle with an EF of 60% , left atrialenlargement , 1-2+ mitral valve regurgitation , 1+ tricuspidregurgitation , and mild pulmonary hypertension ( with pulmonaryartery pressure of 43 ). The patient had fine rales on her admitexam with BNP of 160. Of note , on 10/6 at Warden Memorial Hospital thepatient had her Lisinopril increased to 15 mg b.i.d. to facilitatebetter blood pressure control. ACE inhibitor and Lasix were heldduring this admission due to arise in her creatinine. Lisinopril wasrestarted at a dose reduction of 5 mg b.i.d. and Lasix was restartedon 3/1 in the setting of symptomatic chest pain which began while thepatient was receiving a second unit of blood ( see heme below of moredetails ). Her BNP following the transfusion was 265. The current planis to titrate ACE inhibitor to affect as long as her creatininedoes not climb.Rhythm: The patient had asymptomatic sinus bradycardia with rates ranging45-58 until 5/3 when she had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapidventricular responseto 130s to 140s. She was effectively treated withLopressor 25mg x1 , 5 mg IV x2 , then diltiazem 10 mg x1. The patient laterthen converted to sinus rhythm , sinus bradycardia. On 6/8 , thepatient had a 12-22 symptomatic ventricular pause. The consultingcardiologist ( Dr. Siebel ) was notified of the atrialfibrillation and ventricular pause event. Dr. Pinetrecommended starting an amiodarone load which has beenimplemented and is currently in progress. He recommended noinpatient EP eval this admission because the patient had nofurther symptomatic pauses. Dr. Selma deferring decision andarrangements for Holter versus loop monitors to the patient'soutpatient cardiologist Dr. BaldrigeAccording to the prior cardiac cath reports , the patient shouldbe on lifelong Plavix. It is Dr. Stayrook 's preference forthe patient to be started on thromboembolic prophylatic Coumadin( in the setting of paroxysmals of atrial fibrillation ) and todiscontinue the aspirin because of possible bleeding risk oncombination aspirin , Plavix and Coumadin. However , he isdeferring this decision to be made by the patient's outpatientcardiologist.Blood Pressure: The cardiologist consultation Dr.Miehe felt that the chest pain and hypertension symptoms couldbe consistent with recurrence of renal artery stenosis. On10/27/07 , a Doppler renal ultrasound was notable for significantre-stenosis of the left renal artery. The patient anangioplasty and stent was placed without peri-procedurecomplication aside from the possibility of small blood loss ( aswill be described in heme section below ).2. Hematology: The patient has baseline hypoproliferativenormocytic normochromic anemia of chronic disease identified byiron studies. Her B12 and folate levels were within normallimits. On 11/8 , the patient had a hematocrit drop from30-26 , but this was considered to be either a lab variant or dueto blood loss in her subcutaneous tissue from previous Lovenoxinjections. Lovenox was discontinued and the team decided to useTEDs alone for DVT prophylaxis as the patient was ambulatory. On10/28 , one day post-angio intervention , the patient was complaining oflethargy. She had a post-procedure crit drop from 30-25 which therepeat study was stable at 25. Her hemodynamicswas also stable as was her leg exam. The Angiography Teamadvised that the hematocrit drop could be as result of blood lossfrom recent angio intervention. The Angio Team advised thatthere will be no need to pursue imaging to search for sourceof blood loss unless the patient has further hematocrit drop or unless shedevelops leg , abdominal and back pain symptoms. Because of thepatient's history of coronary disease , she was ordered for a 2unitsa blood. She only received one unit of blood becauseshe was symptomatic with hypertension and chest pain when thesecond bag was hung ( see cardiovascular pump section above ).Post-transfusion hematocrit was 30.1 and was felt no furtherblood would be needed.3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. Duringthis admission , her oral agents were held and the team implemented theGatea Insulin Diabetic Protocol using NPH basalinsulin and pre-prandial aspart scales. The hemoglobin A1c was6.8.4. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition/renal: The patient hadessentially stable renal function during this admission. Achange in the patient's creatinine from 7/28/28 wasattributed to medication-induced ( likely from recent lisinoprildose increased from last GCGH admit , and/or dehydration ). Lasix wasand ACE inhibitor were both held. Lasix and ACE were bothrestarted on 3/1 ( see cardiovascular section above ).5. Gastrointestinal: During this admission the patient hadreported crampy abdominal pain and diarrhea. The medical teamsuspects possible cause could be ischemia in the setting ofhypertension , as the patient has significant celiac disease thatwas identified on an MRA obtained at Palmtial in 10/13 Allstool studies were negative and as on 9/6 her diarrhearesolved.6. MISC: After a lengthy discussion with the patient , she opted to be aDNI otherwise wanted all other resuscitative measures.IMPRESSION: This is an 82-year-old female who presents withcomplaints of intermittent lightheadedness and sudden onset ofsevere chest and abdominal pressure in the setting ofhypertensive urgency with documented blood pressure of 194/74.Her symptoms resolved with blood pressure control. The medicalteam suspects that:1. The cause of the patient's episodic lightheadedness promptingmultiple visits to the D.sen Health may be from atrialfibrillation with RVR and/or ventricular pauses. Additionalworkup for this can be pursued by Dr. Gehrer as an outpatient.2. Given the significant history of vascular disease and thefindings on recent MRA , the team suspects that the patient mayhave hypertension-induced gut ischemia and microvascular cardiacangina.This is preliminary discharge summary and the discharge addendumincluding discharge medications , final diagnoses and medicalfollowup will need to be dictated at the time of discharge.eScription document: 1-5694568 CSSten TelDictated By: EMMERLING , QUINTONAttending: THON , KERRYDictation ID 5456663D: 9/5/07T: 4/29/07

Since being discharged on 7/22/2006 , thepatient reported that she had been doing well until the date ofadmission when she noticed a 2.5-pound weight gain , increasedshortness of breath with activity and increased oxygenrequirement during the day. She reports that she normally uses 2liters of oxygen at night , however , she was needing the oxygenduring the day. She also reports 2 episodes of substernal chestpain which occurred at rest. There was no radiation , no nausea ,vomiting , or diaphoresis. These episodes of chest pain lasted 3or 4 minutes and resolved with nitroglycerin sublingual. Thepatient also noted that she had been urinating very much , doesreport she had been taking all of her medications as directed atdischarge. She thus called her primary cardiologist , Dr.Bottex , who instructed her to get labs drawn. She was found tohave potassium of 5.4 and a creatinine of 2.3 and thus was toldto report to the ED.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denied any fever , chills , nauseaor vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhea , or rashes.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , she is statuspost PCI to OM1 in 1991 , LAD was stented in 1997 , left circumflexwas stented in 2001 , and the right coronary artery was stented in2002; history of dyslipidemia; history of CHF with an EF of30%-35% , she has a dry weight of 158 pounds; hypertension , mitralvalve repair in 10/18 atrial fibrillation for which she israte controlled and is on Coumadin; history of renal arterystenosis , she is status post a left renal artery stent; chronicrenal insufficiency , she has a baseline creatinine of 1.9 to 2.2;GERD; peripheral vascular disease; iron deficiency anemia;bronchoalveolar lung cancer , she is status post a right upperlobe and right lower lobe wedge resections. Also , history ofuterine cancer , she is status post a TAH-BSO , hypothyroidism , andnon-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.HOME MEDICATIONS: Torsemide 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mgonce a day , allopurinol 100 mg daily , Ativan 0.5 mg twice a dayas needed , Colace 100 mg twice a day , Coumadin 1 mg by mouth inthe evening , ferrous sulfate 325 by mouth twice a day , glipizide5 mg by mouth twice a day , isosorbide dinitrate 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,Levoxyl 100 mcg p.o. daily , multivitamin 1 tablet daily , Nexium20 daily , pravastatin 40 mg each evening , and Toprol 100 mg bymouth daily.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: She had a temperature of97.3 , pulse of 80 , blood pressure 146/76 , and respiratory rate of16. O2 saturation of 96% on room air. HEENT: She had moistmucous membranes. Her oropharynx was clear. She had a leftpupil which was enlarged and nonreactive secondary to that beinga surgical eye. Right eye was reactive. She had nolymphadenopathy. Lungs: left side was clear toauscultation. The right side had decreased breath sounds at thebase , few crackles at the right base. CardiovascularExamination: She had irregularly irregular rhythm. She had anormal S1 , S2 , did not have any murmurs , rubs , or gallops and wasfound to have a flat JVP on admission. Abdominal Examination:She had positive bowel sounds , she was soft , nontender ,nondistended. She did not have any hepatomegaly. Extremities:She was warm and well perfused. Distal pulses were not palpable.She did have trace edema , left greater than right which waschronic. She was alert and oriented x3.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:Pulmonary/Oncology: The patient was admitted in stable conditionand was requiring 2 liters of oxygen to keep her saturations inthe mid 90s. She had a chest x-ray which showed a right pleuraleffusion. Review of previous imaging done on 8/18/2006demonstrated an area of consolidation in the right lower lobe ,which was surrounded by a right pleural effusion of moderatesize. The patient also had a PET scan in early August , whichshowed that the consolidation lit up extensively. Review ofthese studies prompted consideration of possible pneumonia versusa bronchioalveolar carcinoma spread. Pulmonary was consulted andthey suggested starting the patient on antibiotics for possiblepostobstructive pneumonia. She was started on levofloxacin ,vancomycin , and Flagyl on 10/2/2006. She received 7 days ofthese antibiotics while in hospital. On day 4 of herhospitalization , a thoracentesis was performed for bothdiagnostic and therapeutic reasons. The pleural fluiddemonstrated a transudative picture. Gram stain was negative.Cultures did not grow anything. Cytology , preliminary read wasnegative. She had 50 white blood cells and 2000 red blood cellsapproximately 800 mL were removed and the patient felt much lessshort of breath following the thoracentesis requiring much lessoxygen. A followup CT scan was obtained , which showed continuedinfiltrate in the right lower lobe with decreased right pleuraleffusion , no pneumothorax was observed. Radiology felt that herconsolidation was most likely consistent with pneumonia and thatit was not postobstructive given that the bronchioles were in factquite patent and thus it was decided that the patient wouldcontinue a 14-day course of levofloxacin with followup withpulmonary to consider whether or not a bronchoscopy would beindicated for further workup of this patient's infiltrate withfollowup imaging to occur as well.Cardiovascularly , for this patient , ischemia wise , the patientdid have 2 episodes of chest pain prior to admission. She didnot have any EKG changes. Two sets of cardiac markers wereobtained which were both negative , thus assumed that she did nothave ischemic event that occurred. She was continued on heraspirin and pravastatin while inhouse. Pump wise , the patienthas a diagnosis of CHF with an EF of 30%. She presentedapproximately 2 kg above her dry weight. She was continued onher home dose of torsemide 40 b.i.d. and also on the isosorbidedinitrate although this was increased to 10 mg t.i.d. , she wasalso started on hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d. and did diureseapproximately 500 mL to 1 liter each day. She returned to herdry weight and on the day of discharge , has a weight of 72.6 kg ,had been admitted with a dry weight of 74.9 kg. Rhythm wise , thepatient has a history of atrial fibrillation. She was ratecontrolled with her metoprolol 37.5 mg daily. Her Coumadin wascontinued except for brief period during which it was held priorto the tap of this. Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge.Endocrine wise , this patient's fingersticks were well controlled.She was put on a course of Lantus and NovoLog q.a.c. slidingscale as needed. Fingersticks were maintained within a normalrange. Her Levoxyl was 100 mcg daily , was continued and herallopurinol 100 mg daily was continued for her history of gout.On discharge , she is being put back on her glipizide for thediabetes.Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition. The patient came inhyperkalemic. She was given Kayexalate 30 mg x1 in the emergencyroom to which she responded and had a normal potassium throughouther hospital stay.Renal. For this , the patient with her diuresis she did and withthe addition of the hydralazine , she did have her creatinine dropfrom 2.2 down to 1.7 during her hospital admission on the day ofdischarge , it was 1.9 , which is within her baseline for herchronic renal insufficiency.Hematology wise , the patient had a stable hematocrit in the low30s. She was continued on her iron 325 twice a day for her irondeficiency anemia. LENI's also performed and showed no evidence of DVT.On the day of discharge , notable findings on physical exam , shewas afebrile. Heart rate was 71 to 85. Blood pressure 100-114over 40-66. She was saturating 93% to 97% on room air.Cardiovascular Examination: She was irregularly irregular. S1 ,S2 were present. There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. HerJVP was noted to be 9 cm. Examination of her lungs revealed thatthey were clear to auscultation on the left. On the right , shehad crackles approximately halfway up , but did not have decreasedbreath sounds as noted on admission. She did not have anypitting edema.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , allopurinol 100 mgdaily , Colace 100 mg twice a day , ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice aday , glipizide 5 mg twice a day , isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg 3times a day , Levoxyl 100 mcg daily , Toprol XL 100 mg daily ,Coumadin 1 mg q.p.m. , multivitamin 1 tablet daily , pravastatin 40mg daily , torsemide 40 mg twice a day , Nexium 20 mg daily ,levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth , q.48h. for a total course of 4 moredoses , hydralazine 10 mg 3 times a day , Ativan 0.5 mg as needed.DISPOSITION: The patient was in stable condition.PENDING TESTS: Final pathology report on the cytology studiesfrom her thoracentesis is still pending.FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient has an appointment scheduled withher primary care physician , Dr. Theo Damien on 5/27/2006.The patient has a followup with pulmonary medicine on 10/1/2006with Dr. CahueCODE STATUS DURING THIS ADMISSION: Do not resuscitate , do notintubate.PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Dr. Clayton KerrickeScription document: 8-4550862 HFFocusDictated By: FINKBEINER , ESTEBANAttending: GOLIDAY , ALEXISDictation ID 1149846D: 10/21/06T: 11/29/06

STATUS POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY2. ASTHMAHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41 year oldAfro-American woman who has thediagnosis of inferior wall myocardial infarction on 4/26/95transferred from Rahert Hospital for postmyocardial infarctionangina.CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension , smoking , family history ofcoronary artery disease , and CVA. Nodiabetes. She is not postmenopausal , no history of elevatedcholesterol. No previous myocardial infarction history.Two and a half weeks prior to admission while sorting mail , she had20 minutes of Cushing substernal chest pressure , increasedshortness of breath with diaphoresis and radiation down the leftarm and across to the right chest. Initially , she thought she hadgastrointestinal distress. Pain often appeared 1 to 2 hours aftereating , was not associated with exertion , and is questionable ifaffected by position. There were no EKG changes. In the interveningperiod she had several additional episodes of this pain andpresented to HMC where she was treated with Disalcid and Tagamet.The pain persisted in a crescendo pattern until 4/26/95 when shepresented to LSSHA with a complaint of two days of unrelenting chestpressure. She was sent to Ai Community Hospital where she ruled in formyocardial infarction with a CK equal to 1508 MB fractions. MB of126 with a peak of 1900 on 8/6 EKG demonstrated Q waves in 3 andADF. T waves aversions of 2 ST segment depressions in V2 throughV5. She was treated with IV nitroglycerin , heparin , oxygen ,diltiazem , Metoprolol and aspirin. She apparently had additionalpain while on this regimen and was transferred to the Campte Hospital for catheterization and management.MEDICATIONS: Her medications as an outpatient were onlyhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day. Upon transfer hermedications included Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg once aday , Diltiazem CD 240 mg once a day , Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. , IVnitroglycerin , IV heparin , and Percocet for pain.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies , but has an allergy to seafood- she gets hives.FAMILY HISTORY: As above. Coronary artery disease andcerebrovascular accident in the early 40's in bothher father and mother.SOCIAL HISTORY: She smokes one pack a day of cigarettes for thepast 20 years with occasional alcohol.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit atthe Mouth- Butlham Hospital is notablefor a blood pressure of 130/85 , the pulse is 79 , respiratory rateof 16 to 20 on three liters of 100% face mask. HEENT exam -sclerae are anicteric , pupils equal and reactive to light ,extraocular movements are intact , oropharynx were clear. There wereno carotid bruits , jugular venous pressure at 6 cm flat. Chest -there was a poorly healed scar on the anterior chest. Lungs wereclear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. No CVAtenderness. Cardiac exam - PMI nondisplaced , regular rate andrhythm , normal S1 , split S2. There is a 2 out of 6 whooshingcrescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the left upper sternalborder that radiates to the apex. There was an S4. Abdomen - obesewith a surgical scar in the right upper quadrant. Nohepatosplenomegaly. Femoral pulses are intact with a right bruit.Extremities were without edema , symmetrical distal pulses.Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Reflexes were intact. Toes weredowngoing bilaterally.LABORATORY ON ADMISSION: Notable for potassium of 3.8 , a whiteblood cell count of 13.6 , hematocrit of37.8 , platelets of 179 , magnesium 2.3 and CK of 201 , PT-PTT 13.2 ,59 with an INR of 1.2. Urinalysis was notable for 25 to 30 whiteblood cells , 5 to 10 red blood cells , 2+ squamous cells , 1+leukocyte esterase. There were no effusions or evidence of failureon chest x-ray.HOSPITAL SUMMARY: On admission this is a 41 year old woman withmultiple cardiac risk factors who ruled in foran inferior wall myocardial infarction and is now experiencingpostmyocardial infarction pain either secondary to current anginaversus pericarditis , although there was no EKG evidence to supportthis. In the IH she was treated with heparin , beta blocker ,aspirin. Calcium channel blocker was discontinued. IVnitroglycerin was continued , oxygen. The patient was scheduled fora catheterization of the heart the morning after transfer withpretreatment of 60 mg of Prednisone x two for history of shellfishallergy. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 10/12/95with the results being right atrial filling pressure of 8 ,pulmonary capillary weight pressure of 12. There was a third OM( first large OM was noted to have a thrombus nonobstructive withgood distal flow. ) The remainder of the coronary arteries weredeemed normal. On the 7 of October , the patient was transferredout of the Coronary Care Unit to the stepdown unit. Of note ,postcatheterization femoral pulses were 1+ bilaterally with a bruiton the right which was there prior to catheterization. Anechocardiogram done demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%with posterior hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation. On the7 of October , the patient was noted to have a white blood cellcount of 20.7 at this time , PTT of 74.3. EKG was notable for T waveinversions in 2-3-S , V2 through V6 which were seen on EKG's from1/7 The patient's MI was felt to be consistent with a lesionfrom the thrombus seen on catheterization. It was thought at thistime that the increased white blood cell count was most likelysecondary to the Prednisone given as pretreatment prior tocatheterization. The patient's does of Lopressor was increased to75 mg four times a day to achieve a heart rate in the 60's. She wascontinued on the stepdown unit on Heparin , IV nitroglycerin andcontinued on cardiac monitor. On the 29 of July , the patienthad an episode of recurrent pain 3 out of 10 , radiating to the leftarm with no associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting , but slightdiaphoresis. At note , at this time , the IV nitroglycerin was beingweaned down. Her vital signs at this event were 130/90 with a pulseof 80. Cardiac exam was notable for a normal S1 , S2 and S4 , no newmurmurs noted on exam. Lung was clear. EKG was notable to be asinus rhythm at a rate of 78 with T wave inversion and 3 and Rwhich were old , as well as ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2which were old and suitable normalization in V6. She was given onesublingual nitroglycerin and the IV nitroglycerin was dialed up.She was likewise given 5 mg IV push of Lopressor for recontrol andSerax 15 mg x one. Her chest pain was reduced to 2 out of 10 withthese interventions with no radiation in the arm. She described itas a heaviness. Blood pressure was 144/87 , pulse was 74. EKG atthis point was notable for sinus rhythm at 75 , normal intervals. Twave inversions in 3R ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2 , V3 , V5with T wave sinusoidality and V6 T wave slightly inverted. IVnitroglycerin was dialed up further , morphine 2 mg x 1 was dividedand oxygen two liters , nasal cannula was in place. Patient waspain-free with these interventions and a second 5 mg IV Lopressorwas given for better late recontrol. Duration of total episode wasapproximately 20 minutes. The pain-free EKG was notable for a rateof 78 wit V5 T wave more upright than sinusoidal and V6 T waveupright , else no change. The IV TNG was dialed up further for ablood pressure of 129/76 and rate was now 70. A second bolus of IVmorphine was obtained at this time. CK and Isoenzymes were sentand Cardiology attending was made aware. The patient was made NPOin case of any need for catheterization the following morning ifsymptoms were to recur. The CK following this event was magnifiedwith a triponin I of 14.1. On the 29 of July it was deemedappropriate to continue with the IV heparin one more day andcontrol symptoms with IV nitroglycerin. if the symptoms were toincrease , it was still deemed appropriate to considering thispatient for recurrent cath. On the 20 of February , the patientreturned to catheterization which demonstrated a discrete 90%distal left circumflex stenosis. There was a PTCA performed of thisdistal stenosis which left a residual 60% stenosis. A stent wasplaced in the distal stenosis to provide a 0% residual stenosis.The lesion in the proximal circumflex developed a greater than 50%stenosis during the procedure , and two stents were placed in theproximal left circumflex to provide a 0% residual stenosis for atotal of three stents in place in the left circumflex. EKG's werestable postcatheterization. There was no remarkable hematoma in theright groin. CK postcatheterization was 64. On the 18 of Novemberthe patient's Lopressor was changed to Atenolol and the patient wasstarted on Coumadin for the stents. The patient at this time on6 of October had a heart rate in the 68 to 75 range with ablood pressure of 120/75% , O2 sats were 99%. As the patient wasbeing coumadinized on the 18 of February , she had asupertherapeutic response coumadinization with an INR of 5.7. Theplan was to recheck the INR to secure a downward trend as well asto start planning for discharge. On the 24 of April , the INRwas 4.6 , demonstrating a downward trend with a subsequent maximumINR , while supertherapeutic , of 6.5.DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged home on June withfollowup with Dr. Mathur and Dr. Stailey at the For Nali HospitalMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg po b.i.d. , AnusolSuppositories one suppository pr q day ,Atenolol 125 mg po q day , Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. , Lisinopril 5 mgpo q day , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual q 5 minutes xthree prn chest pain , Coumadin 4 mg po h.s. , Axid 150 mg po b.i.d.Diet - low fat , low saturated and low cholesterol.On discharge , patient was stable with followup as above.Dictated By: LANE STRYJEWSKI , M.D. CC04Attending: WINFRED G.

The patient states that overthe last several months since October , 2001 , she has notedincreasing dyspnea on exertion and decreased exercise tolerance.She also has noticed episodes of palpitation. She presented to herprimary care physician in October , 2001 with these complaints. Heput a Holter monitor on her 10/1/01 which showed her to haveparoxysmal atrial fibrillation with rates between 67 and 214 with amean rate of 117 beats per minute. Her primary care physician , Dr.Esmond , initially put the patient on digoxin and Coumadin. Herrate remained elevated , however , so he changed the Coumadin toCardizem. About one month ago he also added propafenone 150 mgp.o. t.i.d. On 10/5 she presented to her cardiologist , Dr.Cowser , complaining of continued palpitations and ankle edema.He stopped her Cardizem at that time as he felt that was what wascontributing to her lower extremity edema and placed her onatenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d. instead. She had a leepy Holter monitorplaced from 8/29/23. Wednesday morning , her second day ofatenolol , she noted having episodes where "I felt my heart pauseand then surge when it started to beat again". This was associatedwith lightheadedness x several seconds. She did not have anyassociated chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea and vomiting ,diaphoresis or syncope. She called Dr. Cedotal on 6/16 and hetold her to stop her atenolol and continue her propafenone. Overthe last two days she has had flutter episodes of irregular heartbeat but has had no lightheadedness since stopping the atenolol onWednesday. She has noted increased shortness of breath over thelast couple of days , as well , on climbing one flight of stairs.She also has orthopnea using two pillows at night , does not havePND , does have lower extremity edema. On the day of admissionwhich was 10/25/01 Dr. Mcferrin received a transmitted Holter recordingfrom Viewden Medical Center that showed the patient had normal sinus rhythm withepisodes of atrial fibrillation with high rates but also that shehad episodes of 6.6 second pauses. Thus , she called the patientand had her sent via ambulance to the Cole General Healthemergency department for consideration of admission for pacemakerplacement. In the emergency department the patient's vitals wereshe was afebrile with a pulse of 112 , blood pressure 150/81 ,breathing 18 , satting 95% on room air. Her review of systems wasnegative for fever , chills , or sweats , chest pain , syncope ,abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria or rash. Inthe emergency department she revealed 40 of IV Lasix and was sentto the floor.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is a 52-year-old femaleresting comfortably at 45 degrees , in noacute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal , round and reactive to lightand accommodation. Oropharynx revealed moist mucous membranes , noerythema. Neck veins appeared to be around 10 cm. CHEST:Wheezing bilaterally and crackles at both bases. CARDIOVASCULAR:Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1S2 , did have an S4 and did have a3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at the apex to the axilla. Shealso had a 1/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left uppersternal border. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with goodbowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Warm , well perfused. She did have 2+lower extremity edema.LABORATORY DATA: On admission. Sodium 146 , potassium 3.6 ,chloride 117 , bicarb 19 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 ,glucose 120 , CK 76 , troponin 0 , CBC showed a white count of 8.73 ,hematocrit 29.1 which was around her baseline. Her baseline hadbeen 30-38 on the last admission. Her platelets were 289. ESR was75 which is what it had been in July . INR was 3.1Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascularredistribution. Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at94 with a normal axis , normal intervals. She did have left atrialenlargement as well as right atrial enlargement. Her last echodone at MH on 10/13/01 showed an ejection fraction of 63% ,concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , LV systolic functionpreserved , a thickened mitral valve , moderate to severe mitralregurgitation plus left atrial enlargement , aortic valve thickened ,mild AI , no AS. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation , moderatelyincreased pulmonary artery pressures , normal RV plus her atrialenlargement and they made notes that the mitral regurgitation wasincreased on this echo when compared with an echo done one yearprior at BKTMC .PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Breast cancer status post leftmastectomy with lymph node dissectionin 5/1 Pathology revealed invasiveductal carcinoma , grade 3/3 , nodenegative. She is status post fourcycles of Adriamycin and cytoxan.2. History of lupus x 21 years.3. History of rheumatic heart disease.4. History of hypertension.5. History of asthma diagnosed three yearsago.6. History of recent atrial fibrillation.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lisinopril 40 q.d.; prednisone 10 q.d.;Coumadin 5 q.d.; Prevacid 30 q.d.;chloroquine 100 q.d.; Plaquenil 200 b.i.d.; Lasix 20 q.d.;albuterol inhaler p.r.n.; Flovent 220 2-3 puffs b.i.d.; Flonaseb.i.d.; propafenone 150 t.i.d.ALLERGIES: Tetracycline which give her nausea and vomitingand sometimes she got that with aspirin.SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a nurse currently on a medical leave ofabsence. She lives alone. Tobacco history shedoes smoke 1 pack per day since she was 23. No ethanol.FAMILY HISTORY: Brother with sarcoid plus a history ofhypertension. Father with prostate cancer.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: From an ischemia standpointshe ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Wedid continue her antihypertensive regimen of lisinopril 40 q.d.From a pump standpoint we felt that perhaps her mitralregurgitation was the main cause of her 2-3 month history ofincreasing dyspnea on exertion , exercise intolerance , andincreasing orthopnea. Thus , we got a repeat echo which showedborderline left ventricular hypertrophy with an estimated ejectionfraction of 55% , normal RV. The mitral valve was moderatelythickened and rheumatic in appearance. The mitral valve area wasestimated at 1.3 cm squared although this may have an underestimate. There is severe mitral regurgitation and moderate leftatrial enlargement. The aortic valve was calcified. There wasmild aortic insufficiency. There was mild tricuspid regurgitationwith a regurgitant velocity of 3.5 consistent with mild elevationin pulmonary systolic pressures of approximately 48 mmHg plus rightatrial pressure. Given her severe and symptomatic mitralregurgitation we then decided that she would likely benefit from amitral valve replacement. Then we proceeded to cardiaccatheterization. Her left heart catheterization showed a leftdominant system with clean coronary arteries. Her right heartcatheterization revealed elevated right ventricular and pulmonaryartery pressures and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of31. She was diuresed several kg from her admission weight with IVLasix and she was continued on her ace inhibitor for afterloadreduction. Consultation with Dr. Mazingo of cardiothoracic surgerywas obtained and he felt that patient would indeed benefit greatlyfrom an MVR. Thus , plan was made for patient to be discharged homeand then to be readmitted electively when Dr. Brocks returned fromvacation for an MVR. From a rate and rhythm standpoint , thepatient was in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of her hospitalstay. We continued her propafenone and Coumadin for her history ofatrial fibrillation and she did have excellent rate control onthis. She had no further pauses on telemetry during hospital stayand thus it was felt that given she was asymptomatic and did nothave any pauses off of beta blockade , that she did not needpacemaker placement on this admission.2 ) Pulmonary: From a pulmonary standpoint we felt that likely shehad cardiac asthma as with diuresis her wheezing and shortness ofbreath was nearly 100% improved.3 ) Rheumatology: From a rheumatologic standpoint her lupus was ingood control. She did not have of her typical lupus flare symptomssuch as arthralgias or rash , fever and , thus , we continued her onher Plaquenil , her chloroquine and her prednisone.4 ) Renal: She did not appear to have any renal involvement of herlupus and her renal function was within normal limits throughouther stay.5 ) Heme: She had a normal cytic anemia at 29 which was within herbaseline range of 29-38.

Given lactulose QID.Mental status improved significantly in first 24 hours ofhospitalization. Patient then remained at her baseline mental status forrest of hospital stay.++MSK - Patient has history of chronic low back pain that islikely related to bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures seen on MRI on6/5/06. We avoided increasing her narcotic dose for concern of heraltered mental status. Pain was controlled effectively with MSIR prn ,celecoxib daily prn ( should not increase to bid given ? increase risk ofcardiac side effects ) , and a lidoderm patch over her lower back. OtherNSAIDS were avoided given h/o GI bleed. Patient is scheduled to f/u withDr. Stayner ( Rheumatology ) for management of her back pain andconsideration of sacroplasty. Patient should be seen by PT at her nursinghome to help her with her walking.++GI/ID - Had low-grade fevers overnight on HD 1 and 2.

She was treated with Ciprofloxacin andMetronidazol starting on HD 1 , and vancomycin until speciation of bloodcultures. Blood cultures repeated on 11/18 and 7/27were negative to date. Coag neg staph blood cultures were thought to bedue to contamination. Patient has remained afebrile and abdominaltenderness has resolved over hospital stay. Vancomycin was discontinuedon HD 3 and Cipro and Flagyl were continued. She was discharged withinstructions to complete a 14-day course of Cipro and Flagyl. Her WBCcount and platelets decreased gradually throughout her hospital stay andwere 3.88 and 122 respectively. A CBC should be checked on Monday 6/25 tomake sure that she is not becoming neutropenic or thrombocytopenic.++Pulm - The possibility of PE was considered given lower extremityswelling and her change in mental status. Given that she was at herbaseline oxygen requirement and had negative LENIs , PE was thought to below probability. She remained at her baseline oxygen saturation ( 93-98%on room air ) for the duration of her hospitalization. Given flovent forknown COPD.++CV - EKG at admission was unchanged from previous EKGs. Patient's doseof Lopressor was decreased , given her low BP at time of admission. Herheart rate and blood pressure remained in the normal range throughout heradmission.++Endo: MRI read from 3/8/06 showed evidence of osteoporosis. Startedcaltrate , vit D.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS IS CEREBRALPALSY WITH MENTAL RETARDATION.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 27 year old black manwith a history of cerebral palsy andmental retardation who now presents with chest pain of three daysduration. His cardiac risk factors include positive family historyand a history of hypertension. He does not smoke tobacco and hasno history of diabetes. Note that the patient is a very poorhistorian , however , through his mother , he complains ofapproximately three weeks of increasing fatigue and malaise. Theweek prior to admission , he had a single episode of chest pain at"work" ( actually his day activity center ) which resolvedspontaneously. Three days prior to admission , the patient hadpoorly defined chest pain with marked diaphoresis. This pain wasworse with deep inspiration and , in addition , he had generalizednausea and malaise with shortness of breath. This pain waxed andwaned over the day and was not exertional in nature. He was seenat Childmiltrich Health Care where no laboratories were drawn and he wasreferred to follow-up on Friday. One day before admission , thepatient had chest pain radiating to the left upper arm withnumbness in that extremity. He had nausea and occasionaldiaphoresis. He had an echocardiogram on that day at Tal Hospital which revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy but noregional wall motion abnormality and was otherwise normal. On theday of admission , the patient complained of increased severity ofchest pain with shortness of breath. He "felt sick" but deniedvomiting or diaphoresis. He came to the Sta Medical Center Emergency Room where he continued to complain of chestpain radiating to the left shoulder as well as into the abdomen.This symptom was worsened with inspiration as well as with centralsternal palpation. At baseline , the patient does little exercisesecondary to his cerebral palsy , he has three-pillow orthopnea butno paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and he has no prior episodes ofchest pain except as described above. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Significant for cerebral palsy as above and also for pneumonia in1986. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes no medications. ALLERGIES:He has no allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke tobacco ,he does not drink alcohol , and he does not use intravenous drugs.He is a regular church goer , he lives with his mother , and attendsa day rehabilitation care center. FAMILY HISTORY: Significant forangina in his mother and a grandfather with coronary arterydisease.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was afebrile , his blood pressure was160/130 , heart rate was 65 , respiratory ratewas 20 , and he was 98% saturated on room air. He was an obeseblack man in no acute distress. SKIN: Clear. HEENT: Theoropharynx was clear , there was no jugular venous distention ,carotids were 2+ and equal , pupils were equal , round , and reactiveto light and accommodation , and the neck was supple withoutlymphadenopathy. The fundi were not well seen secondary to poorcooperation. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: There was aregular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 were heard , and there was aII/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.ABDOMEN: Obese with positive bowel sounds , it was non-tender ,slightly tympanitic , there was no hepatosplenomegaly , and thepatient was guaiac negative. EXTREMITIES: Examination revealed noclubbing , cyanosis , or edema. There was no focal tenderness andpulses were intact bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: He was alert andoriented times three and he was unable to do simple calculations ,however , cranial nerves II-XII were intact. Sensory and motor inthe upper and lower extremities were within normal limits , reflexeswere brisk and symmetric , and toes went down.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with anaxis of 0 degrees and normal intravals.There was left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage in aVL and therewere no acute ST or T wave changes , however , there was no old EKGfor comparison. An SMA 7 was benign , a CK on admission was 283with 10 MB , white count was 9.4 , and urinalysis was negative.Chest X-Ray initially revealed evidence of pulmonary vascularredistribution , however , a repeat chest X-Ray an hour later wasclear.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor and givenhis rather indistinct complaints , a broad-basedwork-up was initiated including a rule out for myocardialinfarction. Although the patient continued to have elevated CKwith elevated MB , these were electrophoresed and found not to beMB. There was concern given the pleuritic nature of his chest painthat the patient may have suffered a pulmonary embolism. Lowerextremity non-invasives were negative as was a VQ scan. Thepatient was kept on cardiac monitor until his rule out formyocardial infarction was complete. Throughout hishospitalization , the patient continued to complain of diffuse bodypain as well as "feeling sick" , however , he continued to beafebrile with normal laboratories. On the second hospital day , thepatient became aware of the fact that his mother had been admittedto an outside hospital for a rule out myocardial infarction. Hebecame quite agitated and at that time complained of increasingabdominal pain. He was treated with laxatives and reassurance andseemed improved. On the fourth hospital day , it was felt that thepatient was not suffering from any serious illness and that themost dangerous entities had been ruled out. It was felt that hewas most likely suffering from a viral flu syndrome. His bloodpressure was controlled with a beta blocker and he was dischargedin stable condition to home.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,Nifedipine XL 30 mg p.o. q.d. , and Pepcid 20 mg p.o.b.i.d.

In fact , your studies were improved fromyour previous studies of yoru heart. It seems that your pain is likelymore due to your shoulder arthritis since the heart study weperformed was negative for blood flow problems to the heart. When youhave shoulder pain , you should try heat to the painful area ( or ice ifthat helps more ) as well as Tylenol. You may also try ibuprofen in smalldoses. Ibuprofen ( also known as Advil or Motrin ) is available in genericform in your drugstore. It is not good for your stomach or your kidneysso you should take only a very small amount as detailed in your dischargesummary. Because you had low blood sugar on admission to the hospitalwe would like for you to take your diabetes pills only once a dayinstead of twice a day until Dr. Daghita tells you differently.Yourmedications are otherwise unchanged from your medications prior to youradmission.

He initially had lowerabdominal pain 4/10/2007. He went to see his primary caredoctor on 7/26/2007 where labs were drawn. He had one episodeof emesis ( watery and nonbilious ). On the day of admission , hewoke up with chills and called his PCP who recommended he go tothe ED for further evaluations.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Remarkable for a poor appetite. He deniedany shortness of breath , cough , current abdominal pain , diarrhea ,or dysuria. In the ED his temperature was 104.8 , his bloodpressure was 70/45 , with heart rate in the 120s. His exam wasalso remarkable for altered mental status with confusionregarding dates and requiring frequent reorientation. A centralline was placed and he was given vancomycin , levofloxacin , andFlagyl prior to transfer to the MICU for further care.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes type 2 which hasbeen diet controlled , hypercholesterolemia , coronary arterydisease status post 4 vessel CABG in 2004 , EF of 35% ( per echo in2004 ) , history of A-Fib on chronic Coumadin , a history ofperipheral vascular disease status post left popliteal bypass ,bilateral ankle grafts , gallstones on right upper quadrantultrasound in 2/27MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin , atenolol , lisinopril , Lasix ,Zocor , digoxin , Cilostazol , multivitamins , Protonix , K-Dur ,Ambien , lorazepam , and Coumadin.ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes hives , Norvasc , Plavix ( GI upset ).PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission on transfer to floor afterMICU stabilization , temperature 97.9 , heart rate 99 , bloodpressure 98/60 , respiratory rate 20 , sating 100% on 2 liters. Ingeneral , he was awake and alert , and appropriately answeringquestions. His HEENT exam was notable for upper dentures.Otherwise , his oropharynx was clear. His neck was supple , aright IJ was in place. He had no bruits. His lungs were clearto auscultation bilaterally. His heart rate was tachycardic ,irregularly irregular , without any murmurs. His abdomen wassoft , nontender , nondistended , with good bowel sounds with nohepatosplenomegaly and a negative Murphy's sign. His extremitieshad no edema. There were trace DP pulses. His bilateralextremities were cool. His neuro exam , he was alert and orientedx3. He was moving all extremities and his cranial nerves wereintact.STUDIES/PROCEDURES:Surgery: A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted andfailed. "White bile" drained from his gallbladder , his liver wasvery friable. The surgeons aborted the procedure and recommendedmedical therapy.CT of Abdomen/Pelvis: Demonstrated ascending/transverse colitis.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:1. Cholecystitis/Bacteremia: The patient presented with septicphysiology with the source thought to be acute cholecystitis. Hewas brought to the OR for laparoscopic cholecystectomy which wasaborted due to his liver disease causing his friable liver andhis high operative risk. The surgical team recommended medicaltherapy. He improved markedly on Cipro/Flagyl and is planned fora 2-week course at discharge. Due to his liver disease ,hepatitis serologies were checked which did not reveal ongoinginfection. It is recommended that he follow up with agastroenterologist for further workup.2. Cardiovascular ( Ischemia ): Mr. Budhu has a history ofCAD status post CABG with an episode of hypotension/sepsis. Inthis setting , he had an NSTEMI with troponin peaking at 0.95. Heis continued on his aspirin and his statin.3. Cardiovascular ( Pump ): Given his septic presentation , hisantihypertensives were initially held. They were restarted 3days prior to discharge , and Mr. Caccia had pressures in the90s but was asymptomatic with these pressures. It was thoughtthat he was clinically dry. So , Lasix was held at discharge withthe plan to restart them with any weight gain ( the patient weighshimself daily ) , shortness of breath as advised by his cardiacnurse ( who will see early on the week of discharge ).4. Cardiovascular ( Rhythm ): Mr. Cano has a history ofA-Fib on Coumadin , digoxin , and atenolol at home. He will bedischarged on Coumadin/digoxin/Lopressor given his marginal bloodpressures with low-dose beta blockade.5. Heme: The patient's INR increased to 3.9 at the time ofdischarge ( likely secondary to Cipro and Coumadin interaction ).This was discussed with the patient's Dalethom Nym. Hospital anticoagulationnurse and plans were made to hold Coumadin for 3 days' time andrecheck it on 11/23/2007.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , ciprofloxacin 250 mgevery 12 hours , digoxin 0.25 mg daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. twicedaily , lisinopril 2.5 mg at bedtime , Maalox p.r.n. upset stomach ,Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. , omeprazole 40 mgb.i.d. , oxycodone 5-10 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain , Zocor 40 mg nightly ,multivitamin one tablet daily.eScription document: 7-0215912 HFFocusDictated By: HOYMAN , DEVINAttending: BERNS , LEON DALEDictation ID 2937489D: 3/24/07T: 3/24/07

Neurologically , she is alert andoriented x 3 with no focal deficits. Extremities - she is able tostand on her feet with no motor or sensory deficits.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/1/95 with concernfor her being at high risk of skin breakdown andinfection. Plans were made for panniculectomy , however , prior tothis procedure , she was admitted for IV Ancef t.i.d.; Hibiclenzshowers and sub-q Heparin. Preoperatively , her pulmonary functionwas assessed and found to have an FEV-1 of 53% of predicted; FVC of57% of predicted and an FEV-1/FVC of 93% of predicted. Chest x-rayshowed no active cardiopulmonary disease and an EKG showed a normalsinus rhythm with a non specific T wave abnormality without changesince 1994. Her hematocrit preoperatively was 39.8 and her whitecount was 9. A pulmonary consultation was also obtained because ofconcern about her pulmonary status for the operation. On theirrecommendation , the patient was treated with Azmacort inhalers ,Albuterol nebulizer , and aggressive chest PT. On 8/10/95 , thepatient was taken to the operating room where a panniculectomy wasperformed by Dr. Stanczyk , without any complications.Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the Co Wauhendprings Ton ICU , whereshe continued to be intubated and on ventilatory support.

The patient had had anegative catheterization just two years ago and it was unclearwhether or not her troponin leak was from epicardial coronaryartery disease or from another source such as pericarditis orerosion from endocarditis into her myocardium. Also , given theback pain , there was a concern for aortic dissection and a chestCT was done on 8/4/04 which showed no aortic dissection. Shewas continued on heparin , Plavix , aspirin , and beta-blocker andwill be restarted on her ACE inhibitor , was not restarted inhospital , by her PCP. Given her continued neck pain with endemicST changes which included depressions in V2 through V5 , and hersubstantial elevation in her troponin I to a peak of 64 , acatheterization was done that demonstrated thrombosis on OM2 atthe ostia which was thought to be embolic. All her othercoronary arteries appeared normal , so this 100% lesion wasangioplastied to 50% residual. Post procedure course wascomplicated by pulmonary edema with rising O2 requirement. Shediuresed well with improvement to room air , satting 100%. Sheagain had neck pain in V2 through V5 depressions on 6/17 , justthree days after the catheterization on 3/25 This wasmedically managed because the dynamic changes did not return andthought to be left over plaque from the last lesion. The patienthad been stable for about one week before discharge without anycomplaints of neck pain whatsoever and her troponins had trendeddown significantly during this event. The patient had notcomplained of any symptoms while walking.Pump-wise , her echo showed an EF of 60% with preserved LV and RVfunction. Her old RVSP increased roughly to 65 , possibleincrease in mitral gradient. The patient had had RVSP before andit had been increased at roughly to 55 mmHg. Possible increasein mitral gradient and no veg on her echo though it was tough toevaluate given her artificial valve. The patient then had a TEEwhich was negative for vegetation or thrombus. It was thoughtthat the thrombus she had already thrown to her OM2 would mostlikely be the thrombus that she had had and there was none lefton the valves. For that reason , patient was volume overloadedand was diuresed on torsemide 100 PO b.i.d. which seems to be agood regimen for her as far as her dry weights seem to be around50 kilos , maybe even 48 kilos , and she should have daily weightschecked.Rhythm-wise , the patient had A. fib. She was on tele and noevents and she is being anticoagulated both for her valve and forher A. fib.ID-wise , she had increased white blood cell count and a leftshift with one band , the right lower lobe infiltrate andcompleted a 7-day course of levo. Was afebrile throughout thehospitalization and had negative blood cultures , and again thenegative TEE.Heme-wise , her INR goal is now 3 to 4 , ideally 3 to 3.5 , and thisis essential. Patient will follow up with the Coumadin Clinic.Her INR was 5.3 on 1/4/04. She was treated on 3/25/04. Shehad an INR of ??__?? She is to be drawn by the VNA the next day ,11/4/04 , and they should call Coumadin Clinic with the result.Given high INR , we held the Coumadin on 10/20 and restarted doseon 6/26 at a dose of 3 q.p.m.Respiratory-wise , the patient finished levo for presumedpneumonia and had no other respiratory problems. She didcomplain sometimes of subjective shortness of breath , but heroxygen saturation remained at 100% throughout the rest of thehospitalization besides after the cath.GI-wise , she is stable. She got some simethicone for gas and abowel regimen. She was doing well , but given her continued pain ,GI and surgery consulted on her for a question of mesentericischemia. A CT angiogram of the abdomen was performed withnegative workup for mesenteric ischemia. They thought that mostof her discomfort was due to constipation.FEN-wise , we replaced her lytes. Also we put her on carnitinefor diet supplementation.Renal-wise , the patient had increase in creatinine secondary tothe dye load from the cath and both her CT scans. The creatininewas .9 on day of discharge. We held off on starting the ACEbecause of this , but she should consider getting an ACE to add toher regimen given her diabetes and recent MI. That should bestarted as an outpatient.Endocrine-wise , her diabetes is in really poor control. She hadsugars ranging from 40 to 400. We changed her regimen to Lantus26 units q.p.m. along with novalog pre-meal with 16 beforebreakfast and 8 of novalog before lunch and 8 of novalog beforedinner. Her sugars improved greatly , all in the 100s. She hadsevere osteoporosis as well and vitamin C deficiency. Considerstarting Zometa as an outpatient per primary care doctor , Dr.Cuaresma Prophylaxis with heparin and Nexium.DISPO: She refused rehab and wanted to go home with services andshe should get home PT and a home VNA. She is full code.PLAN: Follow up with the Coumadin Clinic and get her blood drawnevery 2-3 days. The VNA should call 107-568-5779 with theresults of her INR. In addition , her goal again is to have anINR of 3-4. She should follow up with Dr. Waley , hercardiologist , in 1-2 weeks and Dr. Jason Sorto will come tosee her on 3/2 , 11:30 a.m. at her house. I also recommendedthat patient not add salt to her diet and not drink fluidsgreater than one liter per day and also check her daily weights.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.

Two days prior to admissionhere , she experienced shortness of breath at rest and somelightheadedness. At baseline , she becomes dyspneic after walking20 feet secondary to obesity and many years of smoking. She alsonotes several days of headache and some questionable darkening inher visual fields bilaterally. She admits that her p.o. intakehas been rather poor since coming home secondary to anorexia andthat she has felt dehydrated. On review of systems , she alsonotes chronic waxing and waning erythema of the right lowerextremity which in recent days has worsened with accompanyingswelling and mild tenderness , although her son says that it hasbeen worse in the past. Also , she has noted loose stools since8/4/06. She denies chest pain , pleurisy , abdominal pain , bloodin her stool or urine , dysuria , change in frequency , character orurination , or focal weakness. No new medications other than arecent antibiotic course at Dale Skin Sonmu Medical Center completed there forpneumonia. She has not taken her lisinopril or methadone in thelast two days. She has no sick contact. She saw her PCP on2/8/06 who found her to be hypotensive and hypoxic and thensent her to Ma County Hospital ED. Her family is not clear on herdischarge diagnosis , but they report that her kidney function wasabnormal and she was dehydrated. She was not admitted. She thencame to the ED at Town Medical Center And Clinics for persistent shortness ofbreath and dizziness. In the ED , her vital signs were that shewas afebrile , her systolic blood pressure was in the high 60's ,her heart rate was 110 , respiratory rate in the 30's , and O2saturations were in the high 80's. She was given vancomycin ,Levaquin and gentamicin and 3 liters of normal saline. She wasaggressively given fluids and was started on Levophed for bloodpressure support. Her EKG was notable for low voltage onprecordial leads and borderline right axis deviation. Chestx-ray showed cardiomegaly , but otherwise clear. In the MICU , herblood pressure was stabilized on Levophed , but she was also notedto drop her blood pressure to the 70's when initiated on her homeBiPAP settings.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:She had endocarditis 20 years ago. She has obstructive sleepapnea , on her home BiPAP , morbid obesity , and hypertension. Shehad a right ankle injury more than 20 years ago during the motorvehicle accident , which was complicated by an ankle infection.She has chronic right lower extremity pain and she is onmethadone. She had a Klonopin overdose. She had Enterobacterpneumonia. She was treated with cefepime at that time ,questionable the vancomycin. She has a questionable diagnosis ofCOPD with her extensive smoking history. In a well state , herPCO2 was 49 , her O2 saturation is 89% , and she has also historyof depression.MEDICATIONS AT HOME:Lisinopril and methadone. She is not taking her lisinopril. Shehas in the past taken lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide.ALLERGIES:She is allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs.SOCIAL HISTORY:She smoked half a pack a day for 30 years. No alcohol for threeyears. No illicit drugs. She lives at home , but does not work.She is on disability.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:She was afebrile , heart rate in the 100's , blood pressure 130/80 ,respiratory of 18 , and O2 saturation 95% on 8 liters of oxygen.She was awake and alert and in no acute distress. She isanicteric , without pallor. She had a thick neck. Pulmonary:She had decreased breath sounds and crackles at the basesbilaterally. Cardiovascular: She was tachy , regular , butdistant S4. JVP was difficulty to ascertain secondary to neckhabitus. Her abdomen was obese , + bowel sounds , nontender andnondistended. Extremities were without erythema of her legs , butwith mild swelling of the right lower ankle. The ankles werewithout swelling and with full range of motion. Neurologically ,she was alert and oriented , but unfocused in conversation , movingall her extremities. Her strength was intact.LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:Please see LMR.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:This is a 49-year-old woman with a recent ICU stay at an outsidehospital who presented with hypotension , tachycardia , and acuterenal failure. Presentation was most consistent with rightpulmonary embolus and right ventricular failure.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Pulmonary/Vascular: There was initial concern for a PE giventhe presentation of severe hypotension , tachycardia , and Aagradient without evidence of infection or primary cardiacdisease. An echo showed a dilated RV with depressed RV functionsuggestive of PE. Her initial PE scan was nondiagnosticsecondary to poorly timed contrast and motion of the patient. AVQ scan showed intermediate probability. She was started onheparin drip with a goal of 60 to 80. Her second PECT showed asmall PE to the right upper lobe , but it was not large enough toexplain her dramatic presentation. The working hypothesis isthat there was a significant recanalization prior to this repeatCT which took place two days after the first CT. She wasinitially on oxygen in the ICU. She was never intubated. Shewas on face mask , and upon transfer to the floor , she was onnasal cannula 4 liters. Her O2 saturations were acceptablein-house , although she did desaturate to 90% when she took heroxygen off a night. She multiple times refused BiPAP while inthe hospital , but she will go back on it when she returns home.2. Cardiovascular: She had a mild troponin elevation onadmission , likely secondary to RV strain. She had severehypotension and was on two pressors. She was weaned off of theseon 3/9/06 , but did have an episode of hypotension when herBiPAP was started. She was given a little bit of low dosedobutamine and then she was weaned off of that on 10/4/06.Rhythm: She has no active issues. We continued to hold herlisinopril while in-house. Her blood pressures were stable , butnot high enough to withstand on additional blood pressurelowering medication. It was discussed with her PCP that sheperhaps will need this medication restarted as an outpatient.She does have a history of severe hypertension.3. Renal: As she was in acute failure on admission with acreatinine of 6.9 , it dropped to 0.5 , most likely this was due toprerenal azotemia and decreased renal perfusion in the setting ofhypotension. Hypoperfusion of the kidneys in setting ofhypovolemia and right heart failure resulting in decreased leftventricular preload. Mucomyst and bicarb were given prior to thePECTs of her renal protection. She did not develop anyadditional contrast nephropathy after her CT scans. Hercreatinine on discharge was 0.6.4. Endocrine: She had a normal increase in her cortisol levelwith ACTH stimulation. Her fingersticks were monitored while shewas in-house and she never had any need for supplemental insulin.5. FEN: She was on a house diet.6. ID: She was empirically covered on admission withvancomycin , levofloxacin and gentamicin. Her antibiotics weregiven again on 10/8/06 and on 2/8/06. There was no evidenceof an infection found , no fever , normal white count , with anormal differential , normal UA , chest x-ray is withoutinfiltrate , and antibiotics were discontinued on 2/5/06. Shecontinued to remain afebrile in-house without any evidence ofinfection.7. Urology: She did complain of bladder spasms while having theFoley in place. She was started on Ditropan. She had multiplenegative urinalysis and urine cultures. Once the Foley wasdiscontinued , she was able to void and she stopped having bladderspasms. She was started on Monistat for a yeast infection.8. Allergy: She did have an elevated eosinophilia onpresentation and it was 4% on admission and increased to 8% on2/5/06. On the day of discharge , it was 7.5. There is noclinical evidence of allergy , rheumatic disease or parasiticinfection. Her obstructive lung disease may be of an asthmavariant , and there is the possibility she may need inhaledcorticosteroids as an outpatient.9. Heme: She was on unfractionated heparin for her presumed PEuntil 2/5/06 and then she was changed to Lovenox in the morningof that day on 120 mg subq. Her weight at that time was 157 kg.Her Coumadin , her initially given 10 , then a dose of 5 and then 2dose of 7.5. Her INR was therapeutic on the day of discharge at2.5. She will continue on the Lovenox for two additional days.Her INR will be monitored by Dr. Kid , her PCP.10. Psych/Addiction: We are continuing her methadone. It hasbeen switched from 20 mg p.o. daily to 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. She wasalso given a little bit of Ativan while in-house to help with heragitation and anxiety. She was initially given a little bit ofHaldol , but that was discontinued on 1/29/06 and there was noadditional need for that. She did have a central line placed on10/18/06 , which was discontinued on 2/5/06 without any evidenceof any line infection and without any problems. She was seen bySocial Work and PT. The patient refused to go to any sort ofrehab or nursing home. It was decided that the patient wouldreturn home with skilled nursing and with PT as needed.eScription document: 8-6509749 EMSSten TelDictated By: MCMAIN , MITCHELLAttending: MCDUGLE , VINCENZODictation ID 5085941D: 11/12/06T: 11/12/06

With cardiologyservice consulting , she was increase to lasix drip at 15/hr on HD3 , withi/o goal 1-2 l neg. She did well on this and by HD5 was near her dryweight of 49kg and her drip was transitioned back to PO lasix. She is noon lasix 80 po bid , which is felt to be adequate to maintain her dryweight. She was continued on Hydralazine , lopressol and was restarted onIsordil on HD3 , titrated up to 20 tid. She has history of MI withstents and was continued on Asa , Plavix , Zocor.

The patient's cardiacrisk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , andpost-menopausal. She presented to an outside hospital in 1992 withsubsternal chest pain. A cardiac catheterization at that timerevealed an right coronary artery with diffuse disease , moderate tosevere proximal left anterior descending artery lesion at diagonal1 , moderate mid- left anterior descending artery lesion , and atight left circumflex. She underwent a PTCA of the left circumflexartery with improvement. She was well until approximately one yearago when she began having exertional chest pain. Her chest painhas been worsening over the past several months and has beenoccurring with less and less exertion. She was admitted in Julyof 1996 for chest pain and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.An exercise Thallium test was negative. She was well until Februaryof 1997 when she again developed exertional chest pain. She saidthat the chest pain was substernal. It had no radiation and nonausea or vomiting and no diaphoresis. She had an exercise test on10/15/97 where she was only able to exercise for three minutes andstopped secondary to shortness of breath. She was scheduled for anelective catheterization on 9/20/97 but her chest pain has beenslowly worsening over the past couple of months. She reports ahistory of exertional chest pain at only one-half block. Normallyher chest pain was relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. Onthe evening prior to admission she woke up at 3 a.m. with severesubsternal chest pain. She had no relief with three sublingualnitroglycerin and , therefore , presented to the emergency room.In the emergency room she was made pain-free with IV nitroglycerin.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease as above. Diabetesmellitus.MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , and Metformin.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency roomdepartment with chest pain but became pain-freewith sublingual nitroglycerin. The heparin was started in theemergency room and the patient was given aspirin. The patient'sadmission ECG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with no changes fromher previous ECG.During the first several days of admission the patient begancomplaining of some left chest pain but , on further questioning ,the pain was under her left breast and radiating to her right backand she was tender to palpation. Examination under the left breastrevealed three to four vesicles on an erythematous base felt to beconsistent with zoster. The patient was therefore started onFamvir with some improvement of the pain and the lesion. Inaddition to the superficial chest pain the patient did have somechest pain which was felt to be cardiac in origin although she didnot have any ECG changes. She was continued on nitroglycerin andheparin and her Lopressor was increased as tolerated.The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on 5/26/97.Although the final catheterization report is not available yet , thecatheterization showed three vessel disease with normal leftventricular function. It was felt that the patient needed to gofor coronary artery bypass graft but , due to the fact that she hadthe herpes zoster under her left breast , it was decided to wait todo the coronary artery bypass graft until her zoster had improved.Therefore the patient was discharged to home and will undergocoronary artery bypass graft in several weeks. Prior to dischargethe patient was seen by surgery and anesthesia for her preoperativeworkup. There were no complications.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH26 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. , Lopressor 100mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual q5m times three ,Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q4h p.r.n.pain , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , Famciclovir 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. times 7days.

Chest x-ray: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.SUMMARY: This is a 62 year-old woman admitted with two weeks ofdry cough , malaise , and resolving gastrointestinalsymptoms suspicious for a slowly resolving viral infection coupledwith mild congestive heart failure.HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient was ruled out for amyocardial infarction while in the hospital. Thepatient had multiple nocturnal episodes of bradycardia and seconddegree heart block with occasional irregular PR intervals. Theseepisodes were mostly asymptomatic although she did suffer oneepisode of flash pulmonary edema on 1/21/02. Echocardiogram wasdone in the hospital which showed an ejection fraction of 61% withno wall motion abnormalities and mild concentric left ventricularhypertrophy. Dobutamine MIBI was also performed and this showed noischemia. The electrophysiology service was consulted and theydetermined that the patient was not a candidate for pacing. Whileshe was in the hospital , the patient enjoyed excellent diuresis onIV Torsemide and was discharged on p.o. Lasix.Pulmonary: The patient had a persistent cough which improved withdiuresis and with a five day course of levofloxacin to treatpossible bacterial bronchitis. Nocturnal oxygen saturation monitorrevealed likely obstructive sleep apnea with episodic desaturationsto as low as 57%. These episodes of desaturation were coupled withsecond degree AV block as mentioned above.
