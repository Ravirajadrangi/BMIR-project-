The patient is a frail elderly woman in noacute distress. She has poor dentition. JVP is difficult toassess secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. Lungs were clear toauscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed bradycardiawith heart rate in the 50s that was irregular , S1 plus S2 with3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout with mechanical sounding S2.Abdomen was mildly tender to palpation in the mid epigastriumwith no rebound or guarding. Extremities showed venous stasischanges in her lower extremities bilaterally. Feet were coolwith diminished DP and PT pulses. On neurological exam , she wasalert and oriented x3 and cranial nerves II through XII wereintact.STUDIES: EKG showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricularresponse with heart rate of 53 , widened QRS , a Q wave in aVL , andU waves in the lateral leads.Chest x-ray showed improved pleural effusions and pulmonary edema , stable markedcardiomegaly.X-ray of the right hip showed ,1. Status post right total hip arthroplasty with stableperiprosthetic lucency and cortical remodeling.2. Severe left hip osteoarthritis.3. Diffuse atherosclerosis.EGD on 10/24/06 showed hiatal hernia , fundic polyps withpathology showing hypoplastic and inflammatory lesions; mildantral erosions with pathology demonstrating mild regenerationthat was nonspecific and no H. pylori; and duodenitis withpathology showing normal mucosa but no active bleeding or signsof recent bleeding.Capsule endoscopy on 7/5/06 showed a healing gastric ulcer likely in theantrum , small bowel lymphangiectasia and angioectasia in the distal smallbowel.Colonoscopy on 9/12/06 demonstrated cecal diverticulum , approximately 3-mmascending sessile polyp and several small sessile polyps in the rectosigmoid.PROCEDURE: Right basilic vein transposition on 9/12/06 by Dr.Jacinto Goonez .HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. GI bleed: In the emergency department , the patient's vitalsigns were temperature 95.4 , heart rate 62 , respirations 16 ,blood pressure 127/66 with SaO2 98% on room air. She was foundto have black guaiac positive stool and GI was consulted. Shewas started on IV Nexium 20 mg b.i.d. and was given vitamin K 10mg subcutaneously and two units of FFP , and she was transfusedthree units of packed red blood cells with Lasix 120 mg IV foreach bag. Of note , the patient had a colonoscopy inWa on 8/26/05 , which showed bleeding rectal ulcers withbiopsies consistent with ischemic colitis. An EGD on 10/24/06showed a hiatal hernia; fundic polyps ( path:hypoplastic/inflammatory ); mild antral erosions ( path: mildregeneration , nonspecific; no H. pylori ); duodenitis ( path:normal mucosa ) , but no active bleeding or signs of recentbleeding. Capsule endoscopy on 7/5/06 showed healing gastriculcer likely in the antrum , small bowel lymphangiectasia andangioectasia in the distal small bowel , which were considered thelikely sources of bleeding. Colonoscopy was performed on9/12/06 to search for angioectasias for which intervention wouldbe possible , but demonstrated only a cecal diverticulum andapproximately 3 mm ascending sessile polyp and several smallsessile polyps in the rectosigmoid. The patient was started onAranesp but had a 5-point hematocrit drop from 32 to 27 on9/12/06 for which she required another two units of blood alongwith Lasix. The patient's hematocrit remained stable atapproximately 30 to 32 and she will be restarted onanticoagulation on Thursday , 12/10/06 , one week after her AVfistula surgery.2.

Thepatient had postoperative right hand coolness , numbness , andweakness ( always with dopplerable radial pulse ) from stealversus neurapraxia , which was improved by the time of discharge.She will follow up with Dr. Chanthasene as an outpatient. Thepatient's creatinine was 3.3 on admission , improved to 2.0 by9/12/06 , which was the day of her surgery and increased again to3.2 on 1/10/06 .  She was given IV Lasix boluses as she hadevidence of volume overload with over eight-pound weight gainduring her hospitalization , and creatinine improved to 2.7 by theday of discharge.3. Cardiovascular:Pump: The patient's ejection fraction is 45% to 50% and she wasgiven 120 mg of IV Lasix for each unit of packed red blood cellsshe received , along with 120 mg p.o. daily with IV boluses of 180mg as needed for volume overload as judged by an increase in herweight. Antihypertensive medications were originally held forher GI bleed and they were restarted on 10/24/06 with systolicblood pressures remaining in the 120s to 130s.Rhythm: The patient has atrial fibrillation with slowventricular response with heart rates as low as the upper 30s.Occasionally , her heart rate appeared regular and was thought tobe junctional escape rhythm. She was asymptomatic throughout herhospitalization. She was discussed with her cardiologist , Dr.Fritz , who will consider a pacemaker as an outpatient.4. Endocrine: She is euthyroid with TSH of 2.422. For herdiabetes , she received nightly Lantus with aspart q.a.c. andsliding scale when eating and Regular insulin sliding scale q.6h.when n.p.o. Fingersticks were elevated to 300s early during thisadmission but improved to the 100s upon increasing her insulindose.5. Musculoskeletal: The patient is status post right total hipreplacement approximately 13 years ago and complained of righthip pain upon admission. An x-ray showed stable arthroplasty andthe pain was improved by the morning of 10/24/06 .  She willfollow with physiatrist , Dr. Allan Kofoed .COMPLICATIONS: Right hand weakness , numbness , and coolnessstatus post AV fistula surgery , possibly secondary to steal orneurapraxia , significantly improved by the time of discharge.CONSULTANTS: Dr. Garfield Kiehne from vascular surgery , Dr. Ambrose Moldrem from gastroenterology.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: Stable vital signs.

The patient has had multiple recentadmissions to H/seases Medical Center .  In October 2005 , thepatient presented with chest pain and was found to be indecompensated heart failure. She ruled out for myocardialinfarction. She was diuresed with torsemide. A MIBI prior tothis admission in October 2005 had showed no evidence ofischemia. The patient was more recently readmitted in July2005. During this admission , she underwent mitral valve repairand tricuspid valve repair given severe mitral regurgitation andtricuspid regurgitation. She had a catheterization on 6/12/05 ,which showed normal coronary arteries , no equalization ofdiastolic pressures , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 ,and 4+ mitral regurgitation. A TTE during this admission showedan EF of 15% to 20% with wall motion abnormalities. She had mildright ventricular enlargement and decreased right ventricularfunction. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 16 plus rightatrial pressures. She was also found to have a 1.5-cmpericardial effusion. On this admission , the patient's primarycomplaints involve decreased appetite , nausea , vomiting , andabdominal pain. The patient reports frequent vomiting aftermeals. The vomitus is nonbloody and nonbilious. The patientdenies diarrhea , in fact , she has been constipated.

Chest x-ray shows stable cardiomegaly withoutpulmonary edema or infiltrate.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular:a. Ischemia. The patient reported chest pain on admission. Thechest pain was atypical for ischemia and that it wasnonexertional. It was pleuritic and it had no associatedischemic symptoms. In addition , the patient had normalcoronaries on a recent catheterization in 3/22 as well as anonischemic MIBI in October 2005. The patient's enzymes werenegative on this admission. The patient was continued on herbeta-blocker.b. Pump. The patient has a postpartum cardiomyopathy with anejection fraction of 15% to 20%. She also has a pericardialeffusion on this admission. On admission , there was no evidenceof tamponade by exam or by echocardiogram. The patient had arepeat TTE on 10/18/05 , which showed pericardial effusion , whichwas slightly larger than that seen in July 2005. There wasrespirophasic variation , but no collapse. The patient's urineoutput decreased on 8/26/05 and she underwent right heartcatheterization , which showed extremely elevated right and leftfilling pressures ( pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the 40s ,right atrial pressure 27 ). The patient was initially placed on aLasix drip. She was also started on IV dobutamine to maintainher blood pressure and for perfusion while being diuresed. Aftera few days on this regimen , the patient had a repeat right heartcatheterization , which showed improved , but elevated left andright filling pressures. A Swan catheter was left in place forcloser monitoring of the patient's hemodynamics and to allow fortailored therapy. At the time of this dictation , the patientwill be tried on various inotropes including dopamine anddobutamine with close monitoring of her hemodynamics. Thepurpose of this is to assess the effect of these inotropes on herhemodynamics , so there would be a time when she requires inotropetherapy at home. The patient was also maintained on digoxin.Her Aldactone was changed to eplerenone given the possibilitythat Aldactone could be contributing to the patient's GIcomplaints. At the time of this dictation , there is a plan inplace to try to add hydralazine/Isordil to the patient's regimenfor afterload reduction if her blood pressure can tolerate this.In the past , the patient had suffered severe hypotension whensuch medications have been added.c. Rhythm. The patient is status post pacer/ICD placement. Shewas monitored on telemetry. Her telemetry will be followedclosely for any evidence of ectopy while on dobutamine ordopamine.2. Pulmonary: The patient has a history of chronic cough. Pastchest CTs have shown ground-glass opacities most likely due toedema , which have resolved on more recent imaging. Pulmonaryfunction test in July 2005 showed an FEV1 of 2.06 , FEV1/FVC of102 , total lung capacity of 3.09 , and a DLCO corrected of 54%predicted. The patient was continued on Advair and was givenAtrovent p.r.n. As mentioned previously , a PECT on admission wasnegative.3. Renal/FEN: The patient has hypokalemia in the setting ofdiuresis. Her electrolytes were monitored b.i.d. and repleted asneeded. The patient's creatinine remained stable less than 1throughout her admission. The patient was maintained on alow-salt , food-restricted diet.4. GI: The patient presented with a number of GI complaintsincluding abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , and anorexia. It isnot clear what the cause of these symptoms is. The patient hadnormal liver function tests. She had a KUB , which showed noobstruction. Her urine culture showed no evidence of urinarytract infection. It is possible that abdominal pain was due toconstipation or as a side effect of Aldactone or even to a lowflow state in the setting decompensated heart failure. Thepatient was continued on a bowel regimen and a proton pumpinhibitor. At the time of this dictation , the patient'sabdominal complaints have resolved.5. Heme: The patient has a history of iron-deficiency anemia.On admission , her hematocrit was 30 with a MCV of 79.4. Thepatient takes iron supplementation at home. This was heldtemporarily in the setting of constipation. The patient alsotakes Coumadin for a low ejection fraction. This is also placedon hold in the setting of various procedures including her rightheart catheterizations and PA catheter placement. It should benoted that the patient has a history of HIT positive.6. ID: On 9/15/05 , the patient had a temperature of 100. Thiswas status post placement of a PA catheter. There was concernfor a line infection. Blood cultures were drawn and the patientwas started on vancomycin. At the time of this dictation , bloodcultures showed no growths to date , but should continue to befollowed.7. Psych: The patient has a history of depression. Sheappeared dysphoric on admission , but denied any suicidality.Both Psychiatry and Social Work were contacted who followed thepatient during this admission and who have followed the patienton previous admission. The Psychiatry Service had recommendedRemeron for sleep , which the patient was given with good effect.8. Prophylaxis: The patient was given Pneumoboots early on inher admission and then was out of bed several times each day.She was also given a proton pump inhibitor.9. Code: The patient is full code.The events that occur after the time of this dictation , thedisposition , discharge condition , followup , and dischargemedications will be dictated in an addendum to this dischargesummary.eScription document: 3-1379082 ISFocus transcriptionistsCC: Cedrick Zmuda MDA Des GreenDictated By: BIEL , TODAttending: KIRBIE , AUSTINDictation ID 0714124D: 7/18/05T: 7/18/05

He had been followed in the O Lake Jack for years with strong indication for interventionalevaluation of his coronary artery disease. The patient had refusedand had been being treated medically inspite of the angina pattern.Recently his angina had worsened and he agreed to undergo moreintensive workup. He was referred for elective cardiaccatheterization. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hospitalization for anepisode of chest pain in S , hypertension and historyof peripheral vascular disease with claudication symptoms.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam the patient's temperaturewas 97.7 , heart rate 60. HEENT: Head andneck exam unremarkable. Lungs: Clear anteriorly. Heart: Regularrate and rhythm , no murmurs appreciated. Abdomen: Soft , non-tender.EXTREMITIES: No edema. Had weakly dopplerable pulses. Of note , hisphysical exam was performed on his emergent admission to thecardiac care unit after becoming unstable at elective cardiaccatheterization.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: His admission laboratory exam wasremarkable for a normal CBC and serum 20general exam. His EKG after cardiac catheterization demonstratedinverted T waves in III , F and some ST depression in V4-V6.HOSPITAL COURSE: On elective cardiac catheterization the patientwas noted to have a 90% ostial left anteriordescending coronary artery lesion. He had EKG changes ,symptomatically had chest pain at catheterization. He was referredfor emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. An intra-aorticballoon pump was placed. He was taken emergently to the OperatingRoom where a 4 vessel coronary artery bypass was performed. Therewere no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively , the patientdid remarkably well inspite of his dramatic presentation. He hadno vascular complications. His intra-aortic balloon pump wasremoved without incident and he had no specific cardiopulmonarycomplications. His only issue at discharge was urinary retention.He failed several voiding trials. Urology Service had consulted andfelt this was likely secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy.DISPOSITION: He was discharged home with an indwelling Foleycatheter with follow-up arranged at AMC Urology.MEDICATIONS: His discharge medications include aspirin 1 a day ,iron , Colace , Mevacor 20mg q day and Tylenol #3 p.r.n. He willfollow-up with his Cardiologist , urology service and with cardiacsurgery.Dictated By: GAIL G. FAHLSING , M.D. CT55Attending: BERRY O.

She states that shestarted to increase her Demadex from 200 mg in the morning and150 mg in the afternoon to 200 mg b.i.d. without significantdiuresis. She has continued to participate in cardiac rehabwithout significant difficulty. Her weight was stable at 174.She did , however , noticed worsening of intermittent dyspnea onexertion and orthopnea , although she denied PND or pedal edema.She denied abdominal symptoms of bloating , no satiety , nausea orvomiting. She denied chest pain , discomfort , palpitations ,lightheadedness or syncope. She does have occasional chestburning. She also noted burning in her feet bilaterally whichhas previously been attributed to neuropathy. On the day ofadmission , she presented to the Outpatient Clinic to have anechocardiogram and repeat exercise stress test with oxygenuptake. She exercised for 4 minutes and 32 seconds achieving apeak heart of 90 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 100/64and stopping secondary to fatigue. Her peak oxygen uptake wasonly 9 mL per minute despite on RER of 1.09. This is essentiallyunchanged from a prior exercise stress test one year ago.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Includes nonischemic cardiomyopathy diagnosed in 1996 , with cleancoronary catheterization at that point. She has history ofhypertension , hypertriglyceridemia , and left bundle-branch blockstatus post ICD and pacemaker placement. Her pacer isbiventricular. She also has a history of urine bleeding. Shehad a recent hysteroscopy and laparoscopy which wereunremarkable.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Included lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily , Toprol 75 mg p.o. daily ,Demadex 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg daily , KCl 10 mEqdaily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , colchicine 0.6 mg daily andEvista 60 mg daily.ALLERGIES:Penicillin.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:She was afebrile with heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 104/66.Her weight was 174. Her JVP was at approximately 16 cm of waterwith hepatojugular reflux to the angle of the jaw. Her carotidupstrokes were brisk without bruits. Her lungs were clear toauscultation bilaterally. Her cardiac exam was regular in rateand rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and audible S3. She has 2/6systolic murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation. Herabdominal exam was benign except for liver edge that is palpableapproximately two fingerbreadths below the costal margin. Herextremities were noncyanotic with no clubbing or edema. Theywere lukewarm.SOCIAL HISTORY:Unremarkable.FAMILY HISTORY:Noncontributory.LABORATORY DATA:Her most recent labs had showed a sodium of 138 , a potassium 3.9 ,a BUN of 67 , a creatinine of 1.9 and glucose of 123. Her LFTswere all normal except for mildly elevated bilirubin of 1.3. Herlast lipids showed a total cholesterol of 128 with 191triglycerides and HDL of 31 and an LDL of 59. Her last CBC wasunremarkable. Her EKG shows an a-sensed V-paced rhythm at therate of 72 beats per minute.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:Cardiovascular: Ms. Helger is a 64-year-old female withnonischemic cardiomyopathy and class II-III symptoms whopresented with worsening volume overload in the setting ofdietary indiscretion. Given that she is already maximized on heroutpatient diuretic dose and somewhat worsening of her renalfunction , she was admitted for further diuresis with IVtorsemide. She was also admitted for the beginning of hertransplant evaluation for potential cardiac transplant. She wasinitially started on IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. with a goal of 1to 2 liters of diuresis per day. She was continued on digoxinand switched over from lisinopril and captopril. Her medicationswere adjusted to optimize her diuresis and avoid hypotensiveepisodes. She did go for a right heart cath on thishospitalization that showed increased RA pressure of 14 and awedge pressure of 35-44 with V wave. Her cardiac index wascalculated at 1.38. Her SVR was calculated at 1600. Her mixedvenous O2 sat was between 52% and 60% when the readings wererepeated. Given that she appeared quite well and Lasix drip wasstarted to accelerate her diuresis. She was maintained ontailored therapy including nitrates for afterload reduction andthe up titration of her captopril. She did have impressivediuresis on Lasix drip. Her transplant workup at this timeincluded PFTs that showed an FVC of 2.64 , which his 86% predictedan FEV1 of 1.82 , which is 75% predicted and FEV1 to FVC ratio of69%. Her corrected DLCO was 14.6 , which was 56% of predicted.She did have as well a carotid duplex ultrasound showing nosignificant stenosis in either carotid artery. Her anklebrachial indices were greater than 1 in both lower extremitiesand her leg pulse volume recording was all entirely normal. Her24-hour urine collection showed a value of 920 mg over the totalvolume which was in the normal range.

The patient usesa walker and wheelchair at baseline.BRIEF PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION: Vitalsigns: Temperature 98.5 , heart rate 49 , blood pressure 160/56 ,respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 99% on room air , weight94.3 kg. General appearance: The patient is in no acutedistress at present. HEENT: Oropharynx is clear. There is nopalatal petechiae. Pupils are equally round and reactive tolight and accommodation. There is no scleral icterus present.Neck: Supple. There is no lymphadenopathy or masses present.Cardiovascular: Rate is irregularly irregular. It isbradycardic. There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at theright upper sternal border that is heard throughout. Jugularvenous pressure is distended and can be seen at the level of theear. Respiratory: There are bilateral basilar crackles.Abdomen: Obese. There are positive bowel sounds. Abdomen issoft , nondistended and nontender. No rebound tenderness orguarding. Skin: There is no stigmata of endocarditis. Thereare no splinter hemorrhages. No Osler nodes or red spots. Thereis 1+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities. Thereare 1+ distal pulses in the upper and lower extremitiesbilaterally. Neuro: The patient is alert and oriented x3 andexam was nonfocal.LABORATORY DATA: At the time of admission , sodium 144 , potassium4.5 , chloride 106 , bicarb 30 , BUN 41 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 83 ,anion gap is 8. White blood cell count of 8.1 , hematocrit 31.7 ,platelets 332 , 000. There are 71% neutrophils , 14% lymphocytesand 12% monocytes. Calcium is 8.7. Urinalysis shows traceblood , 3+ leukocyte esterase. 40-50 white blood cells , 1-5 redblood cells , trace bacteria.STUDIES AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION.1. Chest x-ray shows status post midline sternotomy and CABG.There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette , which isunchanged from prior x-rays. Right lung is clear. There is asmall left posterior pleural effusion , which has been reduced insize compared to his previous x-ray dated 8/29/07 .2. EKG revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm with atrialfibrillation with a rate of 44. There is left axis deviation , aright bundle-branch block and Q waves in II , III and aVF , whichis unchanged from an EKG in 5/3 .HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is an 82-year-old gentlemanwith a history of multiple medical problems most significantlyincluding recent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis , CADstatus post CABG , CHF , atrial fibrillation with a slowventricular response who was transferred from rehabilitation witha fever , positive urinalysis and positive blood cultures withconcerns for endocarditis given his recent AVR. The patient wasinitially started on ceftazidime and vancomycin empirically.Blood cultures were obtained and the patient grew outtwo out of two bottles of Gemella morbillorum from his blood.Urinary cultures were also obtained , which revealed 10 , 000colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cultures were also takenfrom the suprapubic catheter wound site and revealed rare MRSA ,few coag-negative staph and rare enterococci. Once bloodcultures for Gemella morbillorum returned , the patient'santibiotics were changed to gentamicin and ceftriaxone on7/17/07 .  Ceftazidime was discontinued as was vancomycin. Thepatient remained afebrile while inhouse and did not exhibit anysignificant leukocytosis or stigmata of endocarditis.Surveillance cultures obtained after starting antibiotics haveremained negative to date. A TTE was obtained and was negativefor any valvular vegetation. However , given the patient's highrisk for endocarditis , a TEE was obtained , which was alsonegative for any ring abscess or valvular vegetation. Thepatient , however , will be treated for endocarditis given his highrisk.1. Cardiovascular:Ischemia: The patient had no chest pain , chest tenderness orchest discomfort. He does have a history CAD status post CABGand was continued on his full strength aspirin. He was alsocontinued on statin.Pump: The patient was volume overloaded at the time of admissionand was treated with 60 mg of IV Lasix. Following this , heappeared euvolemic and Lasix was held for several days and thengradually became volume overload and was again given 60 mg of IVLasix and then restarted on his home dose of 80 mg p.o. QAM. At thetime of discharge , the patient is slightly volume overloaded , butdiuresing well with 80 mg daily. The patient's Losartan was heldin the setting of his chronic renal insufficiency and initiationof gentamicin therapy. At the time of discharge , his weight is96.6 kg. His I/O goal at time of d/c is 500cc negative daily. He shouldcontinue daily weights. Of note , the patient's dry weight isapproximately 93 kg. Pt's lasix should be titrated as he reaches his dry weight.Rhythm: The patient is bradycardic at baseline down into themid-to-low 30s , is asymptomatic and has in the past refusedpermanent pacemaker placement. All nodal agents should beavoided for this reason. The patient did have several runs ofnonsustained ventricular tachycardia upto 14 beats. Electrolyteswere checked twice daily to keep magnesium above 2 and potassiumabove 4. However , no other medical management was initiatedgiven his bradycardia.2. Infectious Disease: As noted above , there was high suspicionfor endocarditis in this with a recent AVR. He was found to haveGemella morbillorum in his blood and was started as noted aboveempirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime and then changed togentamicin and ceftriaxone on 7/17/07 once gram-positive cocciwere speciated. The patient was initially treated forpseudomonal UTI with five days of ceftazidime , but given thatonly 10000 CFUs grew out , it was decided that ceftazidimecould be discontinued and that there would be some response toceftriaxone plus gentamicin. A PICC line was placed on 7/17/07for continued IV antibiotics and the patient should continue afull six-week course of ceftriaxone and at least a two-weekcourse of gentamicin for presumed endocarditis despiteboth negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogramgiven his high risk for endocarditis.3. GI: The patient was continued on his home dose of Protonixand all his stools were guaiaced and were negative in house. Thepatient should be continued on p.r.n. Colace.4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of insulin dependentdiabetes mellitus. His Lantus was titrated up to 36 unitsnightly and at that level required no sliding scale insulin.5. Renal: The patient was found to have a slightly elevatedcreatinine above his baseline on admission ( 1.9 with a baselineof 1.1 to 1.3 ). This elevated creatinine was thought to likelybe due to his CHF and poor forward flow. As the patient wasdiuresed , his creatinine decreased to 1.4 at the time ofdischarge. Given his creatinine elevation , however , his Losartanwas held and this should be held while the patient is on gentamicin.6. GU: The patient has a history of BPH and at the time ofadmission had a suprapubic catheter that was inserted in 4/10due to difficulty to pass Foley catheter. The catheter wasclamped and post-void residuals were checked and were only 50 mLand the patient was urinating without difficulty with tube clamped ,so Urology was consulted and suprapubic catheter was pulledwithout difficulty. Suprapubic wound was dressed with a steriledry dressing to be changed daily.7. Fluids , Electrolytes and Nutrition: The patient has acurrent input and output goal of 0.5 L negative daily. He is on a 2L fluidrestriction.Electrolytes. The patient has been having twice dailyelectrolyte checks to keep his magnesium above 2 and hispotassium above 4 given his arrhythmias while he is on 80 mg ofLasix daily. This should be continued.Nutrition. The patient was placed on a cardiac , 2-gm sodiumdiet and a 2 L fluid restriction.8. Pulmonary: The patient is to continue on Flovent andalbuterol.9. Heme: The patient was continued on Niferex twice daily foriron deficiency anemia. He was also found to have a very mildeosinophilia , which should be followed.10. Derm: The patient was found to have a skin tear on hisright hand. This is being treated with neomycin ointment andsterile dry dressing changes daily.11. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin5000 units three times daily and continued on his PPI.CODE: The patient is full code.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: Vital Signs:temperature 98.7 , blood pressure is 118-140/60-70 , heart rate35-58 , respiratory rate 18-20 , oxygen saturation 94-100% on roomair , 100% on 2 L. Weight 96.6 kg. On general exam , the patientis in no acute distress. Neuro: The patient is alert andoriented x3. Pulmonary: There are decreased breath sounds aquarter of the way up on the left lung field and there aredecreased breath sounds at the bases on the right lung field.Cardiovascular: There is an irregularly irregular rhythm andwith bradycardia. There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at theright upper sternal border. JVP is 5-6 cm of water. Abdomen:There are normoactive bowel sounds present. Abdomen is soft ,obese , nondistended and nontender. Suprapubic catheter site iswithout purulence or erythema.

Cardiactransplant was in 1985 without complications and in 1989 he had oneepisode of herpes zoster , and was treated for cataract. Heremained stable without cardiac symptoms or exertional limitation.Last had a cardiac catheterization in April of 1994 , showed noevidence of coronary artery disease , normal LV size and function ,normal RV and trace MR. Right heart catheterization on 7/10 showednormal hemodynamics. There was no evidence of rejection on biopsy.There was no history of signs or symptoms localizing infectiousprocess until about five weeks prior to this admission when hedeveloped a flu like symptom , including a dry cough , occasionallyproductive of whitish sputum , general malaise , nasal congestionwith occasional blood streaked secretions , arthralgias and fatigue.He also reports dyspnea on exertion after one flight at moderatepace with occasional night sweats and loose stools. Multiple familymembers were ill with similar symptom complexes. The patient tookone week off from work and felt that he was getting better untilapproximately 24 hours prior to admission when he again hadincreased weakness , muscle and joint aches , fevers to 101.2 P O ,shaking chills , continued dry cough and headache. Diarrheaspontaneously resolved but has had persistent dyspnea on exertion.The patient denies any PND , orthopnea , chest pain , nausea andvomiting. Has had anorexia with a 15 pound weight loss in the pastmonth. He is currently being admitted for evaluation and managementof his flu like illness following his cardiac transplant. He isimmunosuppresed with Cyclosporin , Prednisone and Imuran.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Cardiac transplant; 2 ) hyper-tension; 3 ) status post bilateralcataract surgeries; 4 ) herpeszoster flare.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Vasotec , 10 mg b.i.d.;2 ) Mevacor , 20 mg q d; 3 ) Imuran ,150 mg q day; 4 ) Diltiazem CD , 180 mg q d; 5 ) Prednisone , 10 mg qday; 6 ) Aspirin , 325 mg q d; 7 ) Cyclosporin , 100 mg b.i.d; 8 )Magnesium; 9 ) Robitussin PRN. The patient has no known drugallergies.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.SOCIAL HISTORY: He smoked one pack per day. Deniesalcohol use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a middle aged male inno apparent distress. Temperature is99.3 degrees P O. Pulse is 102 and regular. Breaths are 16 , evenand unlabored , 97% oxygen saturation at room air and blood pressureis 120/76. His skin was within normal limits , mild scleral icterus.Jugular venous pressure was 6 cm. Carotids were 2+ bilaterallywithout bruits. There is no thyromegaly or adenopathy. His lungswere clear bilaterally. Cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2.There are no murmurs , gallops or rubs. There is a regular rate andrhythm. His PMI was non displaced. Abdomen was soft and non tender ,non distended , normoactive bowel sounds with no hepatosplenomegaly.Extremities without cyanosis , clubbing or edema or rashes. Distalpulses were 2+ bilaterally and neurological exam was completely nonfocal.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Of significance , BUN was 27 ,creatinine 1.8 , white blood cellswere 5.3 , with 71% PMNs and 10% bands , 4% lymphocytes , 8% monocytesand 4% eosinophils. Platelet count was depressed at 90 , 000 ,hematocrit was low at 30%; LDH was 302 and elevated; bilirubin waselevated at 2.2 , total over 1.1 direct and Cyclosporin level onadmission was 276. Admission chest x-ray showed enlargedmediastinal silhouette. There was no infiltrates or effusion. EKGshowed sinus tachycardia , rate of 106; axis was +6 degrees ,intervals were .14/.08/.30 and RSR prime in V1 anterior T waveinversion. There were no acute changes. His blood smear showed noevidence of hemolysis. There are no schistocytes.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 50 year old gentleman whois ten years status post cardiactransplant , who presents with waxing and waning flu like illnesswith fevers and left shift. Of note is hyperbilirubinemia with anelevated LDH , in conjunction with anemia , suggestive of hemolysisand also thrombocytopenia. It was felt that patient most likelyhad an infectious process. Infectious Disease was contacted. Thepatient had multiple blood cultures , sputum cultures , sputumanalyses and titers drawn with a completely negative workup , exceptfor E. coli noted on several sputum stains but there is no otherevidence for pneumonia. The patient was empirically treated forseveral days on intravenous Cefuroxime with no change in his fevercurve , which had ranged from 100 to 102 degrees for all the days ofadmission except the last 24 days of admission when patient wasafebrile. Most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms andsigns is a viral illness of unclear etiology. The fevers , jointaches , upper respiratory symptoms all resolved by the time ofdischarge. With regards to the patient's anemia , there was nospecific diagnosis made , despite extensive workup. The hematologyoncology service was consulted , and stated that the patient'speripheral smear was normal , as it had been by our reading. Theystill wanted to check a PNH screen and G6PD level in three to fourweeks following discharge for possible explanations of hishemolytic anemia , although may be possibly related to a viralillness as well. By the time of discharge , the patient'shematocrit was stable at 30% and there was no further increase inthe patient's LDH or bilirubin; in fact those levels were resolvingby the time of discharge. The thrombocytopenia again may berelated to the viral illness and there is no evidence for hemolyticuremic syndrome or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Also duringthis visit , a PPD was checked and it was found that the patient wasanergic , as might be expected with all of his immunosuppressivedrug regimen. At the time of discharge , the patient was feelingwell and no longer complaining of his flu like syndrome.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Aspirin , 81 mg P O q d; 2 ) Cyclo-sporin , 100 mg P O b.i.d.; 3 )Colace , 100 mg P O b.i.d.; 4 ) Vasotec , 10 mg P O b.i.d.; 5 )Mevacor , 20 mg P O q d; 6 ) Magnesium oxide , 420 mg P O q day; 7 )Prednisone , 10 mg P O q AM; 8 ) Diltiazem CD , 180 mg P O q d; 9 )Imuran , 150 mg P O q dCONDITION ON DISCHARGE: GoodDISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home ,feeling well and was no longercomplaining of symptoms.

Shesubsequently underwent DES to ramus and LAD. Flow through the LAD wasonly TIMI 2 by the end of the procedure. Course was complicated bypost-MI pericarditis , apical wall thinning , and mural LV thrombus.She was discharged initially to short-term rehab , then subsequently wenthome w/ weekly f/u w/ cardiac rehab. While at short term rehab , she wastreated w/ doses of lasix as high as 120 mg IV. Following discharge fromrehab , she was ultimately taken off of diuresis b/c of "dizzy spells" shewas experiencing while on lasix.She did well off lasix until 2 weeks ago , when she was noted to havedecreased exercise tolerance and increasing fatigue at cardiac rehab.She says that she is usually able to ambulate for 15 minutes on thetreadmill; she hasn't been able to do this for the past 2 weeks b/c ofdyspnea and fatigue. This has been accompanied by new-onset PND( occurring as frequently as 3-5 times/night ) , 5 pound weight gain , andincreasing abdominal girth. She does acknowledge dietary indiscretionthis past week ( had a can of mushroom soup 4 days ago ). No orthopnea.Mrs. Bloxsom cardiac rehab. contacted Dr. Takach ( her primarycardiologist ) a few days ago to inform her about Mrs. Losey DOE andincreasing fatigue.

Approximately six weeks ago , the patient lifted a 100-poundbag and the next a.m. , noted substernal chest pressure withoutassociated symptoms. This pressure lasted approximately three tofive minutes and resolved spontaneously. Since then , the patienthas had two similar episodes of substernal chest pressure that haveoccurred while he was exerting himself , once while running during abasketball game and once again while running on the beach inWesttpo Racecon Nari Neither episode had associated symptoms ( i.e. , radiation ,nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , palpitations ) , and both episodeslasted less than five minutes and resolved with rest. On the nightprior to admission , the patient was working regripping his golfclubs and noted a pulling sensation into his chest , which againresolved with rest. On the morning of admission , the patient awokeat 4:00 a.m. , noting a 6-7/10 substernal chest pressure associatedwith diaphoresis. The pain persisted for five hours , at which timethe patient presented to MLMC .  At KGH , the patient was found tohave a blood pressure of 152/88 and a heart rate of 76. Hisphysical examination was benign. However , the patient'selectrocardiogram showed new ST depressions in V2-V5 , T waveinversions in AVL , and flat T's in 1 and V6. The patient wastreated with two sublingual nitroglycerins and sent to the Mendwood Hospital .  On route to Icoson Hospital , the patient receivedtwo sublingual nitroglycerin sprays. On arrival , the patient'spain had dwindled to 1/10 , without associated symptoms. Thepatient's blood pressure was 126/80 , with a heart rate of 80. Thepatient was treated with an aspirin , a sublingual nitroglycerin ,nitro paste , Lopressor 5 mg x 1 intravenously , and intravenousheparin. Upon transfer to the CCU , the patient was pain free. Arepeat electrocardiogram demonstrated resolution of ST depressionsand flat T waves , but persistence of the T wave inversion in AVL.The patient was admitted for further treatment and to rule outmyocardial infarction. The patient gives no history of edema ,paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. The patient deniesfevers , upper respiratory infection symptoms , cough , abdominalpain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria , or weight loss.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history issignificant for diabetes. The patient haskidney stones , is status post procedure three to four years ago ,and a history of sinusitis.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: The patient's medications at the time ofadmission included only Glyburide 2.5 mgp.o. q.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is unmarried. He was the part ownerof a bar. He does not smoke , and he does notdrink.FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother had a myocardial infarctionin her 60's.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , tan male in noacute distress. Blood pressure , 126/80.Heart rate , 80. Respiratory rate , 20. Temperature , 98. Oxygensaturation , 100% on two liters. Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throatexamination was anicteric , with oropharynx benign. Neck wassupple , with no lymphadenopathy. Carotids were 2+ , with no bruits.Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Back examinationdemonstrated no costovertebral angle tenderness and no spinaltenderness. Coronary examination revealed a regular rate andrhythm , distant S1 and S2 , and no murmurs , rubs or gallops.Abdominal examination was benign. Rectal examination showed guaiacnegative stool. Extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , oredema , with pulses 2+ throughout , and no femoral bruits.Neurologic examination revealed the patient to be alert andoriented x 3.LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies on admission revealed thepatient's electrolytes to be within normallimits , except for a glucose of 293. The first CK returned 970 ,with an MB fraction of 65.1. Magnesium was 1.6. CBC was withinnormal limits , with a hematocrit of 44.1. Coag's were also normalat 12.7 and 27.4. Chest x-ray showed no enlarged heart and noinfiltrate. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm , with arate of 60 , and no ST-T changes on the 15 of August , 1995.However , electrocardiogram at the Bertgrand Hospital , pain free , showed normalsinus rhythm , with a heart rate of 82 , T wave inversions , AVL , andflat T's in lead 1.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with a diagnosis ofacute myocardial infarction. Electrocardiogramchanges were consistent with lateral or anterolateral ischemia.His peak CK's returned at 1 , 330 , with 54.5% MB fractions. Thepatient was maintained on heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin for72 hours after admission and was started on Lopressor andenteric-coated aspirin at admission. The patient remained chestpain free for the five days post myocardial infarction andunderwent a submax ETT on the 5 of August , 1995. In addition , anelectrocardiogram was performed , which showed a left ventricle with73% ejection fraction , upper limits of normal size , and a questionof inferior wall hypokinesis. On the 24 of June , the patient underwent asubmax ETT , which was stopped secondary to chest tightness , withdiagnostic electrocardiogram changes , maximal heart rate of 96 ,blood pressure of 145/82 , electrocardiogram with 2 mm STdepressions , persisting into recovery. Because of a positive ETT ,the patient subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization , whichshowed a proximal left circ lesion 70% stenosed , which waspercutaneous transhepatic coronary angioplastied to 20% residual ,as well as a mid-left circ lesion 70% stenosed , which waspercutaneous transhepatic coronary angioplastied to a 30% residual.The left anterior descending was found to be diffusely diseased ,without focal stenoses , and the proximal right coronary arteryshowed a 60% shelf-like lesion. The patient did not experiencechest pain or shortness of breath during the procedure. Postcardiac catheterization/percutaneous transhepatic coronaryangioplasty , the patient was maintained on his glipizide andatenolol , 50 mg p.o. q.d. , and enteric-coated aspirin , as well asheparin overnight. Two days after the cardiac catheterization , thepatient underwent a second submax ETT. This he performed withoutchest discomfort or electrocardiogram changes.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home on the 16 of September .CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient's condition at the time ofdischarge was stable.DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will receive diabetic teaching asan outpatient with CH and will follow up withDr. Kalert .DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , sublingualnitroglycerins p.r.n. chest pain , andGlucotrol 5 mg p.o. q.d.Dictated By: HARLAND DELAUGHTER , M.D.Attending: GREG B.

Atthat time , he denied cough , chest pain , shortness of breath , PNDor orthopnea. In the emergency room , the patient was found tohave a heart rate in the 120s with a new left bundle-branchblock. Carotid massage was attempted and the patient blocked to15:1 due to sick sinus syndrome. An echocardiogram was done inthe emergency room , which revealed an EF of 25%. It was feltthat the patient was in acute congestive heart failureexacerbation secondary to the atrial fibrillation with RVR. Itwas deemed at that time too dangerous to pharmacologicallyconvert the patient. He was transferred to the Coronary CareUnit for placement of a transvenous pacer.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.

There is a family history of colon cancer.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:Afebrile , pulse irregular , 125; blood pressure 140/100. Pulseoximetry was 97% on 2 liters. General: This is an elderly malein no acute distress. Neck: Supple , no lymphadenopathy , nothyroid enlargement , JVP at 18 cm with flutter waves. Carotidsare 2+ bilaterally. Pulmonary: Bibasilar rales.Cardiovascular: Irregular rate and rhythm , tachycardic , S1 , S2normal. No murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nontenderand nondistended. Bowel sounds are present. Extremities: Warmbilaterally , 2+ pitting lower extremity edema. No clubbing orcyanosis.LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION:Notable for mild elevation of the white blood cell count of 11.0 ,hematocrit of 40.6 , and platelets of 218 , 000. Electrolytes werewithin normal limits. The creatinine was mildly elevated at 1.3.BNP was markedly elevated at 7931. Coagulation showed an INR of2.9. LFTs were within normal limits. Cardiac enzymes showed aCK of 129 , CK-MB of 5.9 , and an elevated troponin at 0.27. EKG:Atrial flutter with RVR , rate in the 120s , and new leftbundle-branch block. Chest x-ray: Cardiomegaly andcephalization , no acute infiltrate.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN UPON ADMISSION:This is an 89-year-old male with a history of sick sinussyndrome , atrial fibrillation , on Coumadin , as well as congestiveheart failure , who was admitted for atrial fibrillation/atrialflutter with RVR , and decompensated congestive heart failure. Atthe time of admission , the patient was felt to be at risksecondary to his sick sinus syndrome and new left bundle-branchblock. He was felt to be at risk for asystole and symptomaticbradycardia with any blocking agents. Therefore , transvenouspacer was scheduled to be placed in the Cath Lab.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Cardiovascular:a. Rhythm: Shortly after admission , the patient had a temporaryventricular pacer placed on 9/13/05 with a heart rate of lessthan 50. After the procedure , the patient was admitted to theCCU with atrial flutter with RVR and a rate in the 20s. The ratewas intermittently controlled with a combination of IV digoxinand Lopressor. On 6/6/05 , a permanent dual-chamber pacemakerwas implanted with VVI at 50. Throughout the next two days , thepatient's heart rate continued to be difficult to control , butimproved with diltiazem. The patient was initiated on anamiodarone load on 8/22/05 .  The following day , he converted tonormal sinus rhythm spontaneously. At that time , he continued tobe ventricularly paced , and the pacemaker was changed to DDD on10/21/05 .  For the remainder of the hospitalization , the patientremained in normal sinus rhythm and was dual-paced without anyrecurrence of arrhythmias. He will be continued on hisamiodarone load , which was 2.9 g upon discharge and we continuedfor a total load of 10 g.b. Pump: Upon admission , an echocardiogram on 5/23/05 showedan EF of 20-25% with regional wall motion abnormalities noted inthe intraventricular septum , which was akinetic as well as globalhyperkinesis of the left ventricle. On admission , the patienthad indications of heart failure , including increased JVP andbilateral lower extremity edema , as well as pulmonary effusions.The patient was diuresed effectively with low-dose IV Lasix. Hisadmission weight was 91 kg , and upon discharge , it wasapproximately 87 kg. The patient was given intermittent Lasix 10mg IV for diuresis to maintain a negative I&O of 500 mL. Upondischarge , the patient may require continued diuresis with homeregimen of p.o. Lasix. In addition , the patient was noted tohave marked hypertension throughout his stay. Blood pressure wasoccasionally difficulty to control , and at times , required IVnitro drip. Systolic blood pressures were noted to as high as180 and as low as 100 with IV nitro drip. The patient's bloodpressure was managed with calcium channel blocker , beta-blocker ,as well as ACE inhibitor. Upon transfer to the cardiology flooron 10/21/05 , the p.o. diltiazem was increased. Upon discharge ,the patient will be continued on a home regimen of lisinopril 10mg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and diltiazemextended release 360 mg p.o. daily. At the time of discharge ,the patient's blood pressure was well controlled with systolicblood pressures ranging from 110 to 120s.c. Ischemia: Upon admission , the patient had cardiac enzymeelevation with initially 0.27 , which elevated to a max of 1.27 on10/23/05 .  Initially , the enzyme elevations were thought to besecondary to demand ischemia in the setting of an elevated heartrate and volume overload. However , the patient underwent acardiac catheterization on 2/25/05 which showed evidence ofcoronary artery disease , two-vessel disease , specifically , therewas a LAD proximal 90% lesion as well as diffuse proximal-midstanding 80% lesion , as well as RTLV-BR mid discrete 80% lesionbeyond the bifurcation of RPDA. On 2/25/05 , the patient had asuccessful roto-ablation , angioplasty , and insertion of threecipher DES to the LAD resulting in TIMI 2 flow. On 1/1/05 , thepatient returned to the cath lab , and at that time , he had a DESplacement at distal RCA. The patient denied a chest painthroughout his stay. Upon discharge , he was able to ambulatewithout significant dyspnea on exertion or chest discomfort.2. Psychiatry: At the beginning of the hospital stay , thepatient was confused and somewhat agitated. His behavior wascontrolled with Haldol as well as p.r.n. Ativan. The patient'sconfusion and delirium improved significantly , and the Haldol andAtivan were tapered off. Prior to discharge , he was reinitiatedon his home regimen of Zyprexa. The patient has a longstandinghistory of dementia. Geriatrics consult followed in this caseand advised on titration of a Haldol.3. Vascular: Following the cardiac catheterization , the patientwas noted to have a right femoral bruit. A vacular ultrasoundwas obtained on 7/18/05 and did not show any evidence of an AVfistula.4. Heme: The patient is on chronic anticoagulation for atrialfibrillation. Upon admission , his INR was 2.9 and becameelevated to a supratherapeutic level. Therefore , his Coumadinwas held. The patient will be reinitiated on Coumadin when hisINR is below 2. Goal INR will be between 2 and 3.5. Endocrine: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism andwas continued on his home dose of Synthroid 25 mcg p.o. daily.Thyroid function tests were checked and were within normallimits. In addition , the patient was noted to have mildlyelevated fasting blood glucoses during his admission. His bloodsugars ranged from 95 to 182. He was maintained on a regularsliding scale insulin and required only minimal units ofsupplemental insulin. A hemoglobin A1c was ordered , and theresults are still pending at this time.6. GI: The patient was noted to have significant constipationthroughout his stay and was continued on an aggressive bowelregimen , which included Colace , senna , lactulose , and Dulcolax.The patient has a history of GI bleed. He was noted to have asmall amount of blood in the stools secondary to constipation ,but this was resolved with additional bowel movements. Hishematocrit remained stable , with no signs of anemia. The patientdoes have a history of colon cancer for which he underwent acolectomy. He will be followed as an outpatient.7. FEN: Due to the patient's heart failure , he was placed on a2-liter fluid restriction as well as 2 g salt restriction. Thepatient was continued on a low-cholesterol , low-salt diet. Dueto his mild sedation with Haldol , the patient was evaluated byspeech and swallow and initially placed on mechanical soft dietwith some honey-thick liquids. As his mental status improvedsignificantly , the patient was returned to a house diet ,low-cholesterol , low-fat , with the previous salt and fluidrestrictions. The patient was continued on light scalethroughout his stay.8. ID: The patient was noted to have a urinary tract infectionbased on urinalysis upon admission. His culture remainednegative throughout his stay. He was initially givenceftriaxone. Initially , he was started on Keflex following onpacemaker placement for antibiotic coverage , which wasdiscontinued on 1/12/05 .  The patient remained afebrile , with nosigns of systemic infection throughout his stay.9. Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on a PPI. His INRremained subtherapeutic throughout his stay.COMPLICATIONS:None.CONSULTANTS:EP fellow , Dr. Brosi attending Dr. Pizzitola .PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON DISCHARGE:General: This is a pleasant elderly female in no acute distress ,alert and oriented x3. HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic.Extraocular motions are intact. Pupils are equal , round andreactive to light.

She had amild frontal headache , no palpitations , no chest pain , and noshortness of breath. These symptoms lasted two to three hours withslow gradual improvement. She phoned her EGMC doctor who referredher to Moness Medical Center .  On admission , she complainedof no residual symptoms. She had no visual changes , no amaurosis ,no paresthesias or numbness , and was feeling at her baseline. Herhistory , of pertinence , in 1988 , she had a syncopal episode. AHolter at that time revealed some atrial fibrillation andnon-sustained ventricular tachycardia for which she was started onAtenolol. In 1990 , she had a villous adenoma diagnosed andunderwent an abdominoperineal resection complicated bypost-operative atrial fibrillation. She ruled out for myocardialinfarction at that time. For the past year , she has describedintermittent episodes of dizziness , so called room spinning , andfatigue lasting for a few minutes occurring only once a month. Shehas no other significant past medical history besides hypertension.ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies. She is a non-smokerand non-drinker. She is a French speaking woman who lives alonewith a number of family members nearby. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Shewas on Atenolol 50 mg q.d.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant French speaking elderlywoman in no acute distress. Vital signsshowed her to be afebrile , blood pressure 160/80 lying down , 160/80sitting up , pulse 70 lying down with pulse 76 sitting , andrespiratory rate 16. HEENT: Examination showed normal cranium ,atraumatic , extraocular movements intact , and pupils equal , round ,and reactive to light. She had bilateral cataracts detected andher oropharynx was clear and within normal limits. NECK: She hadno jugular venous distention , neck was supple , she had full rangeof motion , and her carotids were 1+ bilaterally with good upstroke.No bruits were appreciated. LUNGS: Clear bilaterally. No spinalor costovertebral angle tenderness appreciate. CARDIAC:Examination showed rate and rhythm were regular , S1 and S2 , an S4was appreciated , and no S3 with a I/VI systolic ejection murmur.ABDOMEN: She had a colostomy , her abdomen was soft and non-tender ,positive bowel sounds , and no masses. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing ,cyanosis , or edema. No rashes were appreciated. NEUROLOGICAL:Examination was non-focal. She was alert and oriented times threeand cranial nerves II-XII were within normal limits. Motorexamination showed 5/5 strength with no pronator drift and sensoryexamination was grossly within normal limits. Deep tendon reflexeswere 1+ bilaterally and symmetric with downgoing toes andfinger-to-nose was within normal limits.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 107 ,bicarbonate 22 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.2 ,and glucose 123. Hematocrit was 38.2% , white count 11.2 with anormal differential , and platelets were 291. PT was 12.9 and PTTwas 24.3. Admission CK was 50. Urinalysis revealed 60-80 whiteblood cells , no red blood cells , and 1+ squamous epithelium in thesediment. Portable chest X-Ray was within normal limits except fora tortuous aorta and admission EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 58 ,intervals 0.18/0.09/0.44 , an axis of negative 21 degrees , there wasevidence of left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria , and aflipped T wave in III which was new compared with an EKG of February1990. There were no acute ST changes. Head CT on admissionrevealed an old lacune in the right internal capsule , someparaventricular white matter low density changes with evidence of alacunar infarct in her right cerebellum which was of indeterminantage.HOSPITAL COURSE: The impression on admission was that this was a75 year old white female with a history ofhypertension and a history of atrial fibrillation , non-sustained ,who presents with a two to three hour episode of vertigo and leftsided weakness which spontaneously resolved. She was admitted forfurther evaluation of this transient ischemic attack thought to bedue either a vertebovascular insufficiency syndrome , anteriorcirculation , carotid stenosis , or an embolus from a cardiac source.Neurology was consulted and , in addition , she was entered on a ruleout protocol for a myocardial infarction. Her abnormal urinalysiswas also of concern despite her lack of symptoms and she wasafebrile. Repeat urinalysis was ordered and urine was sent forculture and sensitivity. Hospital course over the next few days ,the patient remained completely asymptomatic except for anoccasional complaint of mild palpitations , occasional vertigo , andoccasional frontal headache. She was started on Coumadin onhospital day number two for which she entered therapeutic range byhospital day number four. On hospital day number two , she had aHolter placed which showed normal sinus rhythm for 24 hours exceptfor one five-beat run of ventricular tachycardia and two episodesof atrial fibrillation/flutter , the longest lasting thirteen beats.On hospital day number two , she had an echocardiogram which showedconcentric left ventricular hypertrophy without evidence ofthrombus or valvular disease. On hospital day number four , she hada carotid non-invasive study which revealed completely patentcarotid arteries without evidence of stenosis or atheroscleroticlesions. On hospital day number five , she had a magnetic resonanceimaging of her head with angiogram , the results of which werepending at the time of discharge. After being hospitalized forfive days , the patient was completely stable in therapeutic rangeon Coumadin without focal neurologic findings and without obvioussource of her transient ischemic attack beyond a mild transientarrhythmia. Therefore , she was discharged with instructions tofollow-up with her regular TH physician for continued monitoringof her Coumadin dosing and PT levels as well as long-terminstructions for follow-up care.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg q.d. andCoumadin 5 mg q.h.s.SH018/9939EMERSON TURANO , M.D. LG69 D: 10/10/92Batch: 6265 Report: Y6951R7 T: 3/3/92Dictated By: MIKEL MATARRITA , M.S.cc: 1.

The patient was recently admitted from 2/24/06 to1/5/06 for change in mental status , treated for presumed UTIbut grew with yeast but no bacteria. The patient was consultedby neurology for increased somnolence. She had a head CT at thattime that shows encephalomalacia in right MCA distributionconsistent with old stroke with no acute intracranialhemorrhages , midline shifts , or mass effect. No definitemetastatic lesions were observed. Per patient's oncologist , herresponse to treatment has been excellent. She has a negativeEEG. MRI/MRA always shows the right MCA infarct. Normal B12 ,folate , TSH , and RPR. Neurology at that time agreed that nofurther evaluation of somnolence is necessary at this time andleptomeningeal disease is unlikely given her lack of neurologicalfinding. The patient was then transferred to rehab on 1/5/06 .Per nursing and discussion with house staff , the patient has hadwaxing and waning mental status and at times appearing alert andappropriate and other times somewhat hallucinating and agitated.She also had periods of cough and fever and pain on urination.According to the son , she has had a cough for the last 10 daysprior to admission. She has not been eating adequately with foodsticking out from her mouth and not quite responsive. She had achest x-ray done on 7/26/06 that shows a right hilar mass andright upper lobe infiltrate. She was started on moxifloxacin 400mg p.o. daily on 7/26/06 and then she was transferred here atKendertawn Community Hospital at the son's request for change in mentalstatus , cough , and fever and presumed pneumonia.In the ED , her temperature was 98.8 , pulse 122 , blood pressure160/68 , breathing at 20. She got vancomycin , levofloxacin , and 4L of fluids. Chest x-ray was consistent with right upper lobepneumonia , question of postobstructive pneumonia. Her UA wasquite dirty with oxalate crystal , yeast , and 100+ white bloodcells. She was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin forpresumed pneumonia and UTI. Her head CT was negative for anyacute change but also shows chronic right MCA infarct. Thepatient was transferred to the floor for further management.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.

Lytes; her white count is14.2 , hematocrit 37.6. She does have 2% polyps , 6% bands. LFTsremarkable only for elevated alkaline phosphatase of 126.Albumin is 3.4. Her cardiac enzymes are less than assay. Chestx-ray shows overall unchanged ill-defined right hilar mass andprior new faint parenchymal opacity in the right upper lobeconcerning to early pneumonia that can be postobstructive. EKGis tachy , normal sinus rhythm , no ST-T wave changes. Head CT , noacute change , chronic right MCA infarct. Echo , trace MR , EF55-60% , known LV function with diastolic dysfunction.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:This is a 64-year-old right-handed woman with history of stageIII non-small-cell lung cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy ,history of right ICA stroke status post right RCA 3/1/06 ,recent hospitalization for change in mental status and UTI whowas admitted from nursing home for altered mental status , fever ,and cough and dysuria. Found to have pyuria with calcium oxalatecrystal , new right upper lobe opacity concerning forpostobstructive pneumonia. Her head CT was unchanged. Thepatient was admitted for presumed pneumonia and UTI.ID: The patient has elevated white blood cell count bandemia inthe setting of right upper lobe opacity concerning forpostobstructive pneumonia and also with pyuria with yeast. Thepatient received vancomycin and levofloxacin in the ED. She wasbriefly put on vancomycin and levofloxacin and added Flagyl foraspiration pneumonia. She subsequently also switched over tovancomycin , Ceptaz , and Flagyl to cover for pseudomonas. Herurine culture grew out yeast and her blood culture was negativeto date. Her antibiotic regimen was changed back tolevofloxacin , Flagyl on p.o. regimen. On postoperative day #4 ,she was improving. She did have one brief episode ofhypertension on hospital day #2 that responded to IV fluids. Shehas required no escalation in antibiotics and toleratedlevofloxacin and Flagyl quite well. She will continue herlevofloxacin and Flagyl for an additional 14 days. She also gota chest CT that shows right upper lobe pneumonia and alsoquestion of consolidation in right lung with underlyingemphysema. The consolidation is contiguous with the right hilumand underlying hilar adenopathy or hilar mass cannot be excluded.She also has small right pleural effusion. The findings werediscussed with Dr. Szufat who is her oncologist and he felt thatshe is likely having post XRT changes and no further workup isnecessary for now. She will continue to finish her course ofantibiotics of p.o. levofloxacin and Flagyl for 14 days.Urology: Her UTI shows yeast. Given that the fact that she hasmultiple episodes of yeast UTI currently , she was treated withfluconazole for three days.Neuro: She has changes in mental status waxing and waning ,however , the patient's mental status has greatly improvedthroughout her hospital stay although with occasional episode ofhallucinations. For example she was thinking that the residentis her niece. Psych , onch , and geriatrics was asked to see thepatient at the son's request. Both psy onc and geriatricsbelieved that her change in mental status is multifactorial , andis likely a result of delirium rather than dementia. Theyrecommended avoiding pain meds and oversedating meds and startedher on zyprexa 5mg bid , 2.5mg bid prn agitation , and can increaseto 10mg po qhs if necessary for agitation. She was continued onher Lamictal and Cymbalta and has no further neurologicaldecompensation. Her Seroquel was decreased to 50 mg b.i.d.p.r.n. and Zydis 5 mg p.o. p.r.n. , however , she was not receivingthese medications as she was not agitated. She had one dose ofseroquel on 3/11 early am and got really over sedated. Seroquelwas d/c and patient should not be receiving seroquel in thefuture for risk of oversedation. Her vitals were stablethroughout.CV: History of controlled prolonged QTC on Haldol. Her Haldolwas DC'd last admission , is now on Zyprexa and Seroquel. HerEKGs were stable throughout her hospital stays.Heme/Onch: The patient has history of stage III non-small-celllung cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy and is followed byher outpatient oncologist , Dr. Miquel Grothe , at the Nawin Tayjeune Antri- Community Hospital as well as the outpatient psycho/onch socialworker whose name is Dr. Hugh Dress . The patient was seen bypsych/onch and geriatric. Dr. Kiel stated that she does nothave any further chemotherapy treatment planned for the future.He will evaluate her when he sees her again in clinic. She isnot currently at the best medical condition to receive anyfurther therapy.Endocrine: She was given NovoLog sliding scale for diabetes andlevothyroxine for history of Graves' and history of radioiodineablation.FEN: the patient was seen by speech and swallow for question ofdysphagia and difficulty with swallowing and eating. Thepatient's video flow examination shows prolonged oral phase , butshe did well on the rest of her video swallow examination so shewas put on a mince ground diet and thin liquids. Alternateliquids and solids with tongue sweep to remove oral cavityresidue. The patient recommended to sit upright to take smallbites and sips. She should be seen by speech and swallow forfollow up swallow treatments two to three times per week. Shealso was given nutrition consult who started the calorie counts.Nutrition recommended that she may be need long-term nutritionaltherapy if she does not meet her nutritional goal. That will bedeferred to her outpatient doctors at a later time. She willneed assists and encouragement with feeding. She was also givenNexium for prophylaxis and replete her lytes with an AmericanDiabetic Diet with low salt. She was given Lovenox and PPI forprophylaxis.CODE: Full code.The patient is discharged to rehab in stable condition.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache.2.

MDADDENDUMThe patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes ,hypertension , CAD status post MI in 2000 who presented with an STelevation MI to the Emergency Room on 8/23/06 .  He was broughtto Cath where he was found to have in-stent thrombosis in his LAD. The clot wasaspirated and bare-metal stent was placed in his LADand another stent was placed in his diag-2. He suffered multiple V-Tachcardiac arrests requiring CPR and cardioversion. In theCath Lab , he was given bicarb , placed on the epi drip , givenLasix and was intubated. He was thought to aspirate at the timeof intubation secondary to vomiting. A bedside echo revealedglobal hypokinesis with an EF of 35%. He , at that time , wasplaced on a balloon pump , dopamine 16 , amio 1 , propofol 1 , andIntegrilin and brought to the CCU. On the floor , his bloodpressures were difficult to control and his PA catheter readingsindicated a wedge pressure of 47. His MAPs were marginal and max dopamine , maxLevophed , epinephrine and dobutamine were required to maintain a minimal bloodpressure.His family was aware of his prognosis and was there at the timeof his arrest at 3:30 in the morning. CPR was initiated , andACLS was performed until the family decided to terminate the ACLS. At thattime , there were no spontaneous breath sounds , no heart sounds , and nonreactivepupils. The cause of death was thought to be cardiogenic shocksecondary to ST elevation MI.

She wastreated with three days of nafcillin intravenously in the hospital ,starting in 7/19 and has been on oral dicloxacillin since then , sothat she could take antibiotics at home. Her skin changes havewaxed and waned since then so that some physicians involved in hercare felt there was improvement in her clinical condition , althoughthe patient subjectively felt there was none.More recently , the patient's breast has swollen considerably andthe overlying skin has become erythematous and the erythema hasspread to involve the entire breast and around to the back.

The left foot was noted to have biphasic signalsin the DP and PT by Doppler.LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION: Sodium 136 , potassium 4.8 ,chloride 101 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 74.ALT was 36 , AST 33 , alk phos 173 , total bili 0.3 , albumin 4.0.White blood cell count was 9.6 , hematocrit 36.2 , and platelets232. PT 13.4 , PTT 28.1 , INR 1.0. Chest x-ray demonstrated amild interstitial disease with multiple old right rib fractures.X-ray of the feet demonstrated bilateral osteopenia with noevidence of osteomyelitis in either foot. EKG was noted to benormal with a normal sinus rhythm at 63.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Vascular SurgeryService on 10/5/2004 for further evaluation and management. Shewas empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime withwet-to-dry dressings applied to her right foot wound. Thepatient was also continued on her prior dose of Macrobid forpreviously-diagnosed UTI with her antibiotic regimen to bediscontinued for this purpose on 9/8/2004 .  An angiogramperformed on hospital day #2 , revealed a right external iliacocclusion which was stented near the bifurcation of the internaland external iliac vessels. A distal stenosis of the externaliliac was opened with balloon angioplasty to good effect. Thepatient sustained a mild groin hematoma on the left at the accesssite but had no change in her pulse exam there afterwards.Following her angiogram and percutaneous intervention , thepatient was noted to demonstrate excellent right lower extremityDP and PT pulses which remained palpable through the duration ofher hospital course. On hospital day #3 , the patient was broughtto the operating room for debridement of her right foot. For adetailed description of the patient's operative procedure , pleasethe relevant operative note. Patient tolerated the procedurewell and during the procedure , the patient's ulcer base was foundto be contiguous with the first metatarsal head periosteum , andtherefore , a metatarsal head excision was performed. Thepatient's great toe was left in place with moderate debridementof the deep tissues. The ulcers on the lateral right foot werenot debrided at this time. Following her procedure , the patientwas empirically continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime. Heroperative cultures subsequently grew out coagulase-negative staphwhich was sensitive to both Keflex and vancomycin. At thispoint , the patient was switched to vancomycin therapy only andwas continued on VAC therapy through postoperative day #3. Atthis point , the patient's VAC dressing was changed to demonstratea well-vascularized actively bleeding wound with granulationtissue and no signs of wound necrosis. The patient remained instable condition through postoperative day #7 at which point , shewas returned to the operating room for a great toe amputation anddefinitive closure of her right foot wound. For a detaileddescription of this operative procedure , please see the relevantoperative note. The patient tolerated the procedure well and wassubsequently returned to the Regular Outpatient Floor where sheremained for the duration of her stay. A general overview of thepatient's hospital course by system is as follows:1. Neurological: The patient demonstrated significant issueswith pain control for the duration of her stay. A fair amount ofher pain was determined to be secondary to her right foot ulcer;however , the patient was also noted to have significant painassociated with her contracted right lower extremity. For atime , the patient was placed in a right lower extremity extensionbrace which provided some measure of relief; however , uponregular examination of her right lower extremity , it was notedthat she was gradually developing pressure ulcers secondary tothe extension brace. A Neurology and Pain Service consultationwas obtained and the patient was subsequently recommended forZanaflex therapy which subsequently improved her pain controldramatically. The patient otherwise remained intact from aneurological perspective for the duration of her stay ,demonstrating frequent emotional ability consistent with herbaseline examination.2. Cardiovascular: The patient remained stable from acardiovascular perspective for the duration of her stay with noevidence of acute hemodynamic instability or compromise. At nopoint did she demonstrate evidence of acute myocardial ischemiaor infarction.3. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonaryperspective for the duration of her stay with no evidence ofacute respiratory decompensation.4. GI: The patient remained stable from a gastrointestinalstandpoint for the duration of her stay and was noted to betolerant of both solid and liquid oral intake. Upon discharge ,she was noted to be tolerant of both solid and liquid p.o. intakeand was noted to be independently productive of adequate amountsof stool and flatus.5. GU: As described previously , the patient was admitted with aknown diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. She was continuedon Macrobid therapy through 9/8/2004 , at which point thistherapy was discontinued. Subsequent follow-up urinalysesdemonstrated no further evidence of urinary tract infection.Upon completion of her Macrobid antibiotic course , the patient'sFoley catheter was removed and she was noted to be independentlyproductive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of herstay. She at no point demonstrated any evidence of acute renalcompromise or electrolyte imbalance.6. Heme: The patient remained stable with a stable hematocritfor the duration of her stay. She was started on Plavix therapyfollowing her angiogram , on which she remains at the time of herdischarge. DVT prophylaxis was provided via subcutaneous heparinfor the duration of her stay.7. ID: As stated above , the patient's operative cultures werenoted to grow coag.-negative staph , sensitive to both vancomycinand Keflex. For the majority of her stay , the patient remainedon vancomycin therapy but was transitioned to Keflex on1/11/2004 , on which she remained for the duration of her stay.At the time of discharge , the patient has been instructed tocomplete an additional 10-day course of Keflex therapy. Of note ,the patient remained afebrile with a stable white count for theduration of her stay and her wound exam demonstrated no evidenceof further infection at the ulcer site.8. Endocrine: The patient maintained adequately well-controlledblood sugars for the duration of her stay with no evidence ofacute endocrinological compromise. The patient was subsequentlycleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility onpostoperative days 10 and 3 , 7/11/2004 , with instructions forfollow up.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Patient is to be discharged to arehabilitation facility with instructions for follow up.STATUS AT DISCHARGE: Stable.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Nonhealing right foot ulcer status postdebridement and closure with an angiogram and angioplasty.

Thepatient appeared in no apparent distress , awake , alert , andoriented x3. HEENT: Bitemporal wasting , left eye with purulentdischarge. CVS: Normal S1 , S2 , irregularly irregular , mitralvalve click is audible. JVP is 5 cm. Lungs: Clear toauscultation bilaterally. Extremities: Trace ankle edemabilaterally. Neuro: Awake , alert and oriented x3 , no focaldeficits.PERTINENT LABS ON ADMISSION:Sodium 146 , creatinine 1.1. INR 2.1. Urinalysis revealed 2+ketones , 3+ blood , 3+ protein , 15-25 hyaline casts , 25 whiteblood cells and 2+ bacteria. Urine cultures and blood culturesshowed no growth. EKG was atrial fibrillation at a rate of withoccasional pacer spikes and old Q-waves in lead III and aVF andan old right bundle-branch block. Chest x-ray was negativeexcept for cardiomegaly. CT of the head and neck was negative.Left hip and pelvic plain films were negative for fractures.PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION:The patient had an echocardiogram , which showed any EF of 60-65%and moderate-to-severe left atrial enlargement and right atrialelongation.ASSESSMENT:This is an 83-year-old female with a history of multiple fallswho presented after being found down for approximately 24 hoursin her bathroom in the setting of suspected urinary tractinfection and dehydration.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Infectious disease: The patient was found to have a urinarytract infection and was appropriately treated with Levaquin forthree days. After treatment , the patient remained afebrile withno leukocytosis. Urine and blood cultures were negative , and arepeat urinalysis was negative.2. Cardiovascular: The patient had an echocardiogram done whichrevealed an EF of 60-65% and moderate-to-severe left atrialenlargement and right atrial elongation. The patient's mitralvalve was unremarkable. The patient's cardiac enzymes werecycled , and she was found to have a troponin leaksecondary to demand. Troponin leak did resolve. Serial EKGswere done , and there were no change when compared with the pastEKG. She was hypertensive on admission and she was continued onher Lasix and lisinopril , which controlled her blood pressure.Lasix has been held for the past couple of days due todehydration but may be resumed at discharge.3. Endocrine: The patient was taken off of her p.o.hyperglycemic meds while she was an inpatient and placed ondiabetic protocol of NPH 6 units b.i.d. and 3 units of Aspartq.a.c. with the sliding scale. Her blood sugars were wellcontrolled.4. Fluids , Electrolytes and Nutrition: The patient wasdehydrated on admission and given gentle IV fluids. Lasix washeld and should be restarted at discharge. However , at rehab , ifthe patient appears to be dehydrated , her Lasix should bestopped. The patient's sodium at discharge also went up from142-146. Free water is encouraged at the bedside. The patienthad a swallow evaluation to assess for any aspiration. Swallowevaluation recommended mechanical soft diet with thin liquids andstated that the patient had no signs of aspiration.5. Hematology: The patient has subtherapeutic INR that is nowbeing bridged with Lovenox. Her goal INR is 2.5-3.5 given herSt. Jude mitral valve. At discharge , INR is 1.4. The patientshould be continued on Lovenox 60 mg daily , which is renallydosed as well as Coumadin 5 mg nightly until her INR istherapeutic and then the Lovenox may be discontinued.6. Psychiatry: On 8/19/06 , the patient became very agitatedand hostile attempting to exit the bed. The patient was given 1mg of Haldol and required 4-point restraints. The patient had nofurther episodes of this extreme agitation. She does , however ,have Haldol 0.5 mg b.i.d. as needed for agitation. She wasplaced on Zyprexa 2.5 mg nightly , which currently is controllingher behavior. The patient was followed by Psych during thisadmission. At first , the patient was refusing to go to rehab andshe was clearly not safe to go home. Psych did evaluate thepatient to see whether she was capable of making a decision , andPsych did not feel that she had good judgment or insight into herproblems. Psychiatry felt the patient needed to go to rehab andafter convincing , the patient is now agreeable to go torehabilitation.7.

The patient underwentexercise treadmill testing which showed non-diagnostic ST segmentchanges. However , thallium studies revealed decreased perfusion tothe apex , superior portion of the septum as well as theanterolateral wall. There was reperfusion of the high septal andanterolateral wall. The patient then proceeded to cardiaccatheterization which revealed 100% stenosis of her previous graft.Additionally there was 100% mid stenosis of the right coronaryartery , 80% stenosis of the left anterior descending , 90% midstenosis of the first diagonal , and 100% stenosis of the circumflexafter the first obtuse marginal. There was anterior hypokinesis aswell as apical and inferior akinesis. There was severely decreasedleft ventricular function. The pulmonary pressures were fairlyunremarkable. Thus , the patient presented for reop coronary arterybypass grafting.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the Operating Room on11 of October .  Under general endotracheal anesthesiacoronary artery bypass grafting times three was performed. Theright internal mammary artery was grafted to the first diagonal aswell as saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending , theold obtuse marginal graft , and the second diagonal. The patientwas found to have dense cardiac adhesions. Her old right coronaryartery graft was occluded and the old obtuse marginal graft wastightly stenotic at the origin. The left internal mammary arterywas subtotally occluded distally. The patient spontaneouslydefibrillated and demonstrated modestly decreased left ventricularfunction. The patient was taken to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unitin stable rhythm with stable vital signs. Postoperatively thepatient's course was thoroughly unremarkable. The patient requiredsodium Nitroprusside in the immediate postoperative period. Therewas no evidence of postoperative myocardial infarction. Thepatient was successfully extubated on the second postoperative dayand her mediastinal and pleural tubes were also pulled withoutsignificant incident. The patient's diuresis was initiated andtolerated well. The rest of the patient's postoperative course wasunremarkable. She remained in normal sinus rhythm without anyevidence of arrhythmia. She was essentially afebrile and herwounds were all healing well. However , on chest x-ray it wasdemonstrated that the patient had right lower lobe collapse.Because of her afebrile state and good oxygenation on room air thepatient was not bronch'd in order to re-expand her right lowerlobe. At the time of dictation , one day prior to proposeddischarge the patient's chest x-ray showed some improved aerationof that lower lobe. Thus , the patient will likely be discharged on18 of May .DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg po q d , babyaspirin one po q d , Diabinese 500 mg po q d , ironsulfate 325 mg po tid , Colace , Percocet. The patient will bedischarged to home. FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with Dr.Rory Broadnax in four to five weeks and with private medicaldoctor and cardiologist in one to two weeks. The patient will alsohave visiting nurse come in to check on her in the immediatepostoperative period.BK509/0151RAMON H.

Troponin was 0.2 , and therefore shewas started on IV heparin.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 190/82 ,respiratory rate 18 , and oxygen 99% on room air. General: Thepatient was in no acute distress , alert , and oriented only x1 toperson. HEENT: NC/AT. Neck: Supple. Cardiovascular: NormalS1 , S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops.Lungs were clear bilaterally. Abdomen was soft , nontender , andnondistended , positive for bowel sounds. Extremities: No edemaor cyanosis: Neuro exam: Strength was equal bilaterally , butweak 3/5 throughout. Sensation was intact throughout. Cranialnerves III through XII were grossly intact.LABORATORY DATA:Labs on admission showed a white blood cell count of 12.3 ,hematocrit was 36.4 , CK of 3499 , and troponin of 0.2. Her EKGwas normal sinus rhythm , new 1 mm ST depression in leads II , III ,and aVF. Her chest x-ray showed right lower lobe mass , which wasunchanged from her previous x-ray. Her head CT was negative.Urinalysis on admission showed too numerous to count white bloodcells , plus nitrates , and plus leukocyte esterase.HOSPITAL COURSE:This is an 83-year-old with diabetes mellitus , hypertension , andmedically managed b.i.d. who is admitted with change mentalstatus and fall secondary to weakness.1. Infectious disease: The patient was found to have a UTI ,which is likely the reason for confusion and weakness. She wasstarted on ciprofloxacin. Urine cultures were sent and grewKlebsiella and Citrobacter , which were indeed sensitive tociprofloxacin and she was continued on the ciprofloxacin.2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. She had a troponin leak onadmission of 0.2. A B set of cardiac enzymes was negative for , thetroponin level was less than assay. The leak was most likely secondary todemand ischemia in the setting of an infection. A C set of her cardiac enzymeswas negative as well. The heparin was therefore discontinued. Thepatient does have a history of coronary artery disease , but isnot a candidate for catheterization per her primary care doctor'snotes. In-house , she was continued on aspirin , statin and abeta-blocker , which was changed during her admission fromLopressor to labetalol for alpha blocking activity as her bloodpressure remained high and blood pressure optimization wasattempted. Norvasc was also increased to 10 mg daily andhydralazine was given p.r.n. for blood pressure greater than 140 ,for which she received a few doses. She was also continued onlisinopril and Diovan and she was monitored on telemetry. Theonly event on telemetry being a short run of SVT.3. Neurologic: The patient's change in mental status was likelyrelated to urinary tract infection. The head CT on admission wasnegative. Her neuro exam was not suggestive of any focaldeficits. Her Detrol was held during the admission due to itseffect on mental status. Her weakness was likely due todeconditioning. She was very weak and had trouble sitting at theedge of the bed or transferring to a chair with physical therapy.She was seen by physical therapy who recommended rehabilitationand 24-hour supervision. The family refused transfer to aSkilled Nursing Facility despite the recommendation and theyunderstood the concern and risks. They reportedly planned tosupervise the patient on their own , 24 hours everyday.4. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , her bloodsugars were low on admission. Originally , her NPH dose was cutin half. Her blood sugars were monitored and remained quite low.Therefore , her evening NPH was halved again to 5 units atbedtime. Her appetite remained fair during the admission , but notgreat.5. Prophylaxis: She received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.CODE STATUS:DNR/DNI was instituted after lengthy discussions with thepatient's family.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:1. See the primary care doctor within two weeks.2. Discuss with your PCP when and if you should resume Detrol.3. Return to the emergency room if you experience fevers ,worsening confusion , chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea ,vomiting , diarrhea , or other concerns.DIET:No restrictions.ACTIVITY:Bed to chair transfers with assistance and supervision and otherinstructions per home physical therapy.PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:Urinary tract infection.OTHER DIAGNOSES:Hypertension , diabetes , coronary artery disease , hemorrhoids ,depression , hyperparathyroidism , multinodular goiter.LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:Glucose 160 , BUN 12 , creatinine 0.9 , sodium 141 , potassium 4.1 ,chloride 112 , CO2 23 , ALT 32 , AST 29 , ALK 68 , bili T 0.5.Albumin 3.4 , calcium 10.6 , magnesium 2.0 , white blood cell count6.9 , hematocrit 36.9 , hemoglobin 11.4 , platelets 233 , 000 , PTT37.4 , and INR 1.1.MICROBIOLOGY DATA:Urine showed greater than 100 , 000 , 4+ Klebsiella pneumoniae , aswell as 4+ Citrobacter freundii.RADIOGRAPHIC DATA:A portable chest x-ray on 1/13/05 , showed a right middle lobemass , unchanged in comparison to the prior exam corresponding tothe patient's known carcinoid tumor , known pulmonary infiltratesor pleural effusion.

The patient was transferred to theShire Hospital for further care. She deniednausea , vomiting , and had only mild abdominal pain and abdominaldistension noted per the patient. However , her fevers and chillscontinued.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Hypertension , chronic back pain , and nephrolithiasis.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:Right total knee replacement , appendectomy , cholecystectomy , andpartial colectomy at the splenic flexure as noted above.MEDICATIONS:Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , lisinopril 15 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , albuterol nebulizerp.r.n. , Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 15 mg to 30 mg p.o.b.i.d. , oxycodone as needed , and heparin subcutaneous t.i.d.ALLERGIES:No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY:The patient presented after a brief stay for one week at Councoovir Catbelle Medical Center Of .  She is the aunt of a Pageway Hospital cardiologist , Dr. Cavalli .PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Temperature is 98.8 , heart rate 94 , blood pressure 80/54 ,respiratory rate 18 , and oxygen saturation 95% on 2 liters nasalcannula. In general , the patient was in no acute distress. Herchest was clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidenceof wheezes. The heart was regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2normal with 3/6 systolic murmur. Abdomen was soft and obese.Mild tenderness of the inferior aspect of her ostomy stoma. Norebound tenderness was noted. The stoma color was normal. Therewas gas and stool in the stoma bag. Her midline abdominalincision was open with pink granulation tissue. Extremities werenotable for only trace pitting edema.LABORATORY DATA:Chemistry: Sodium 139 , potassium 5.0 , chloride 100 , bicarbonate34 , BUN 25 , creatinine 0.8 , and glucose 187. Liver enzymes: AST8 , ALT 13 , alkaline phosphatase 89 , and T-bili 0.2 , and lacticacid 1.2. CBC: White blood cell count 13.5 , hematocrit 31.3 ,and platelets 513 , 000. Cardiac enzymes were normal with the CKof 33 and MB fraction of 1.2. Troponin was less than assay. EKGshowed left anterior fascicular block and sinus rhythm.IMAGING:CT of the abdomen showed a 6 cm x 2 cm left-sided intraabdominalfluid collection and a 4.2 cm fluid collection around the stoma ,which both were seemed to as consistent with abscess formation.HOSPITAL COURSE:The patient was admitted to the Windreal Claall Onli Medical Center Surgical Service on1/12/05 for management of her intraabdominal abscesses as acomplication of recently performed partial colectomy and Hartmannpouch for perforated diverticulitis. She was started on IVantibiotics with vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl. Bysystems.Neuro: The patient had intermittent issues with pain control ,which were managed by putting the patient on oral narcotic agentsas well as fentanyl patch. This seemed to help the patient'spain. The patient also had an episode of altered mental status ,which was believed to be due to pulmonary issues of CO2 retentionas noted below. For this reason , the patient had beentransferred to the ICU for 24-hour period observation , and at thetime of discharge , the patient was in adequate mental statuscommunicating effectively and at her baseline. Otherwise , noissues at the time of discharge , except for pain control , beingmanaged by narcotic agents.Cardiovascular: The patient was stable throughout herhospitalization. However , it was notable at the time of herprevious admission that the patient would need to undergo anechocardiogram within one to two weeks. For this reason , thepatient underwent an echocardiogram during her hospitalizationand was found to have normal ejection fraction of 65%. Therewere no regional wall motion abnormalities noted. Her aorticvalve showed trace aortic insufficiency and the patient also hadmild degree of aortic stenosis with the valve of 1.4 cm squared.Her mitral valve was shown to have some degree of mitralregurgitation and the patient also had some tricuspidregurgitation as well. Her right ventricle was seemed to be okayand she did have some evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.No evidence of gross cardiac dysfunction.Pulmonary: The patient on hospital day #6 was found to havealtered mental status in the evening. An ABG was checked , whichshowed a pH of 7.42 , pCO2 of 61 , and pO2 of 58 , 92% oxygensaturation on 3 to 4 liters with the base access of 12. For thisreason , it was determined that the patient would need to beadmitted to the surgical ICU for further monitoring of herpulmonary status. She was taken to the ICU and admitted there.During her ICU course , the patient was placed on BiPAP , whicheffectively brought her bicarbonate and her pCO2 levels down.This did effectively decrease her pCO2. Hence by hospital day#8 , the patient was transferred back to the floor in stablecondition. From her pulmonary standpoint , the patient continuedto have some degree of bibasilar crackles during herhospitalization. However , given her otherwise stable status , thepatient was encouraged to perform and sent to spirometry andLasix was withheld during the later course of her hospitalcourse. At the time of discharge , the patient was with adequateoxygen saturation sating 97% on 1 liter at the time of discharge.GI: The patient had no trouble eating regular diet during herhospital course. Her ostomy continued to function well with thestoma pink and healthy. She did have two intraabdominalabscesses , which were drained on hospital day #2 byInterventional Radiology. Two IR catheters were placed and thesewere left in place until the output was deemed to be minimal , anda CT scan was performed as well as an abscessogram , both of whichreveled that the fluid collections had resolved. Hence onhospital day #10 , the patient's interventional radiology drainswere discontinued without complications. At the time ofdischarge , the patient was stable with a soft abdomen and noevidence of infection. The patient did have a midline abdominalincision open with pink granulation tissue , healing well. Thepain was treated with wet-to-dry normal saline dressing , b.i.d.to t.i.d.GU: The patient continued to have good urine output during herhospital course. She did require Foley placement from adequatemonitoring of her urine output at 1.8. Urinalysis , as well asurine culture was sent , which revealed yeast greater than 100 , 000yeast , not Candida albicans. She was started on a five-daycourse of fluconazole and her Foley catheter was discontinued fortreatment of this infection. At the time of discharge , thepatient was urinating adequate amounts independently without anyissues.Heme: The patient's hematocrit remained stable during herhospital course. However , during her stay in the ICU , hematocritwas found to be 27 and the patient received 1 unit of packed redblood cells without any complications or events. At the time ofdischarge , the patient's hematocrit was found to be 43 withoutany event. She continued to receive subcutaneous heparin t.i.d.for DVT prophylaxis.ID: The patient was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacin , andFlagyl during her hospital course for the intraabdominalabscesses. Fluconazole was also added for the treatment of aurinary tract infection with the yeast. The antibiotics werecontinued until the drains were removed on hospital day #10. Onhospital day #10 , the patient was transitioned to levofloxacin ,which is to be continued for a 10-day total course benign1/27/05 , 10 further days of levofloxacin required for adequatecovered. However , it should be noted that the IR drains werefound to be negative and only revealed purulent fluid. Gramstain was indicative of sterile purulent fluid. Cultures werenegative.Tubes , lines , and drains: As noted above , the patient had theplacement of two interventional radiology drains , which werediscontinued prior to discharge. At the time of discharge , thepatient has no Foley and no IR drains in place.MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. pain , albuterol nebulizes 2.5 mgnebulizer q.4h. p.r.n. wheezing , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Pepcid20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , fentanyl patch 25 mcg patch q.72h. , heparin5000 units subcutaneous t.i.d. , lisinopril 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , hold for systolic blood pressureless than 100 and heart rate less than 55 , multivitamins withminerals one tablet p.o. q.d. , Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x13 more doses starting 5/15/05 .DISPOSITION:The patient is discharged to Pa Medical Center for further management.

The patientwas initially started on micafungin IV while speciation andsensitivities were pending. The patient received five days ofmicafungin IV 100 mg IV daily. Cultures then came back withCandida glabrata that was sensitive to fluconazole. At thattime , she was converted over to oral fluconazole 400 mg oncedaily. Surveillance blood cultures with fungal isolators weresent on a daily basis while in the hospital , all of which have come backnegative to date. The patient also had her tunneled catheter line pulled on10/1/07 .  She was evaluated by Ophthalmology to rule outendophthalmitis and was determined not to have evidence of this.She also received a transthoracic echocardiogram to rule outvegetation. The patient has a history of MRSA osteomyelitis witha cord compression status post decompression with hardware andwas continued on levofloxacin and IV vancomycin which wasscheduled to continue until 4/18/07 .  Blood cultures from1/25/07 grew out VRE bacteremia , and the patient was at thattime converted from IV vancomycin to linezolid 600 mg orallytwice daily on 9/27/07 .  She also received one dose ofgentamicin 80 mg IV x1. A new tunneled catheter had been placedon 3/7/07 and given that the blood cultures was VRE grew backpositive on 1/25/07 , it was certain that the new tunneledcatheter was not the source of VRE and the decision was made to treatthrough the line. All subsequent blood cultures from 9/27/07and 2/28/07 are all negative to date. The patient had onetemperature spike to 101 degrees , and she was recultured of thesecultures which were negative. She also had a repeat chest x-raywhich showed only minimal atelectasis and no evidence ofpneumonia. The patient subsequently defervesced. And has been afebrile forover 72 hours. Also , of note ,the patient had a history of C. difficile. She was continued on oralvancomycin for suppression. She did continue to have numerousloose stools during the hospitalization and C. difficile cultureswere sent twice on 6/8/07 and again on 3/7/07 , both of whichwere negative. Also , of note , the patient has sacral decubitusulcer that was watched closely for infection.2. Renal: As noted above , the patient's tunneled catheter wasremoved as it was deemed the most likely source of her fungemia.She was dialyzed once through her temporary femoral line andtunneled catheter was then placed on 3/7/07 and the patient wasdialyzed approximately every two days with the last dialysis on10/11/07 .  The patient is due for hemodialysis on 7/14/07 .3. Heme: The patient has a history of anemia that is consistentwith chronic disease. She received 1 unit of packed red cellsduring her hospitalization.4. Gastrointestinal: The patient , on admission , had right upperquadrant tenderness with an elevated alkaline phosphatase andGGT. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained and to ruleout biliary obstruction. This study showed a normal liver. Agallbladder with a few small stones as well as sludge ,gallbladder wall thickness was normal. There was no sonographicMurphy's sign , and biliary tree was noted to have a dilatedcommon bile duct of 7 mm that was unchanged and distal ducts werenot well seen. The intrahepatic ducts were noted to be normal.The patient's Zocor , however , was held in the setting of elevatedLFTs. Abdominal pain resolved on hospital day 2 and LFTs trended to normal.Also , of note , the patient had a history of C. difficileas noted above. She continued to have diarrhea although her C.difficile cultures were negative. She was treatedsymptomatically with Lomotil. A rectal tube was also placedgiven her diarrhea and increased pain with soiling of ulcer as well as risk ofinfection. Rectal tube should be continued in rehab to preventinfection of the sacral ulcers.5. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of paroxysmalatrial fibrillation with RVR and was continued on her Lopressor ,amiodarone. She did not have any episodes of rapid ventricularrate , nor any episodes of hemodynamic instability orhypertension.6. Neuro: The patient has bilateral lower extremity weaknessand loss of sensation of the right lower extremity likelysequelae of recent cord compression , per Neuro notes in themedical record from 11/22/06 .  The patient also had an episode ofacute delirium. As a result , her Reglan was discontinued as washer fentanyl patch and her mental status improved although shestill had baseline memory deficits. Psychiatry was consulted andrecommended tapering her Celexa and Cymbalta in the setting ofwaxing and waning mental status. The patient has also beencounseled to avoid oxycodone or any other narcotics for paincontrol and to try to only use Tylenol.7. Derm: The patient has a sacral as well as right heeldecubitus ulcer. The wound nurse was consulted , and the patientreceived Panafil ointment to the sacral ulcers twice daily.Sacral wound is to be irrigated with warm saline and then Panafilis to be applied to open areas twice daily , and then wound is tobe dressed with dry sterile dressing , all twice a day. Thepatient has sutures in place from thoracic spinal fusion.Orthopedics was consulted to remove some of the sutures.Approximately , 50% of the sutures , however , were not ready tocome out , and the patient should follow up with Dr. Hans V Cumoletti on 1/12/07 for removal of the remaining sutures. Thisarea should be evaluated at least daily and dressings changedonce daily with dry sterile dressings.8. Vascular: The patient was noted to have oozing at the siteof her old AV graft and the right antecubital fossa on 7/25 .  VascularSurgery was consulted and evacuated a hematoma on 7/25 .  This wound is to bedressed with 2 x 2s , soaked to normal saline and is to be changedthree times daily. The patient is to follow up with Dr. Daron T Pogar from Vascular Surgery in two weeks to evaluate this woundsite.9. Psychiatry: The patient had a flat affect and was thought tobe appropriately depressed in past hospitalizations. She wasinitially continued on Cymbalta and Celexa. Psychiatry wasconsulted and felt that the patient was demonstrating somedelirium , but she was currently not depressed and recommended thather Cymbalta and Celexa be tapered. She is currently in theprocess of being tapered , and this taper should continue as notedin the discharge medication section.10. Pain: The patient was initially treated with fentanyl andoxycodone per rehabilitation regimen. Her fentanyl patch wasquickly discontinued in the setting of one episode of acutedelirium. Her oxycodone was continued and she requiredapproximately 10 mg of oxycodone daily. She , however , has beencounseled to try to wean herself off of oxycodone , and use onlyTylenol for pain given propensity to delirium.11. HEENT: The patient had a history of severe epistaxis. She ,however , has not had any epistaxis during this admission. Shewas continued on saline nasal sprays.12. Fluids , Electrolytes , and Nutrition: The patient was seenby Nutrition consultants. Her zinc and vitamin C werediscontinued to avoid copper deficiency. She was started onMegace 400 mg twice daily , and she was placed on a liberal dietto encourage p.o. intake. The patient required some electrolyterepletion including repletion of phosphate and potassium. Ofnote , phosphate should not be repleted with Neutrophos but withsodium phosphate for phosphates less than 1.5 possiblygiven the potassium load and Neutrophos. At time of discharge however patientdid not have IV acess. Patient should recieve one dose of neutraphos 1 packetx1 upon arrival to rehab. She should then have a basic metabolic panel checkedon 2/12/07 to ensure her potassium is normal.13.

He is followed at SRHO and has multiple multipleadmissions for chest pain and rule out MI in the setting ofreceiving or having just received hemodialysis. On the day priorto admission , 9/17/04 , the patient had chest pain andhemodialysis and was admitted to PACMH where he was ruled out forMI by enzymes. He was discharged from BAHM on 8/5/04 and laterthat day , per the patient , he had a fight with his family membersand stood up and abruptly felt lightheaded and "passed out." Hereports no palpitations or chest pain prior to the event andbelieves that he may have been unconscious for 20 minutes.Talking to the family , the patient was actually attempting tothrow something at this son , fell , and had no loss ofconsciousness after falling. The patient reports that he woke onthe floor and developed severe chest pain with radiation to theleft arm and jaw , which is typical with his anginal symptomsaccording to his cardiologist. He denies any recent change inchronic shortness of breath or exercise capacity , orthopnea , orincreased edema. He had a recent MIBI on 4/7 that showedmild mid anterior and inferior wall ischemia with aposterior-basal scar. He was deemed an obvious surgicalcandidate and has been medically managed.In the emergency department , he received IV fluids , aspirin ,sublingual nitroglycerin x 3 and morphine with resolution ofchest pain. Upon admission to the medical team , his vital signswere stable and he denied chest pain. He was admitted to ruleout myocardial infarction.HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUES:1. Cardiovascular ischemia: This patient with a known historyof CAD who has been medically managed per his primarycardiologist. He has a history of CABG. His last cath was in8/22 that showed diffuse disease. At which time , he receivedstents to the left main and LAD. On this admission , the patientruled out for MI with three sets of negative cardiac enzymesincluding troponin. No EKG changes were noted. He was continuedon aspirin products and beta-blocker as well as ACE inhibitor ,and amiodarone. The patient is not on a statin though he hasbeen in the past; he reports that he had some sort of a reactionto the medication. On the day after his admission , he had chestpain and hemodialysis but was relieved by sublingualnitroglycerin. Over his hospital course , he continued to have2-3 episodes of chest pain per day that were relieved bynitroglycerine and morphine. He had no EKG changes in thesetting of any of these episodes. Isordil was added for improvedpain control briefly. Cardiology was consulted and felt that thefrequency of the pain , the rapid onset and offset , and thereproducibility of the pain to palpation made angina less likely;they did not feel that catheterization or further workup wasindicated.2. Cardiovascular pump function: Initially , the patient was dryon exam , and demonstrated no signs or symptoms of heart failure.He was actually orthostatic by symptoms but his blood pressureremained stable. His story of losing consciousness was difficultto corroborate; if he did indeed lose consciousness , his historyis consistent with orthostasis. Management was monitored by theHemodialysis Service.3. Cardiovascular rhythm: The patient has an ICD for history ofVT , and he is continued on amiodarone. There was concern thatpossible arrhythmia or pacer malfunction could have been thecause of his symptoms. In addition , when he fell he said hemight have fallen on his pacemaker site. On the morning afterhis admission , when he was on hemodialysis , the patient and nurseboth heard a belching sound that seemed to be coming from thearea of the patient's pacemaker. The electrophysiology team wasconsulted and pacemaker was interrogated and found to befunctioning well , with no history of arrhythmia or alarm. EKGsremained unchanged from baseline , except there was a prolongationof QTC with the initiation of Zyprexa , which was stopped. Thepatient's heart rate remained stable in the 50s-60s on hiscardiac regimen.4. Renal: The patient has end stage renal disease onhemodialysis and was apparently incompletely dialyzed on the dayprior to admission. Due to chest pain , it was initiallydifficult to have the patient complete a course of hemodialysisbut over his hospital stay he was dialyzed effectively. He hasarrangements to follow up with his outpatient hemodialysis afterdischarge5. Psychiatry: After ruling out for myocardial infarction ,plans were being made to discharge the patient home and thepatient's family was called. They reported concern that did notwant the patient to return home because of abusive and erraticbehavior by the patient. They reported that actually in thesetting of the patient's fall , the police were called and whenthey arrived the patient complained of chest pain and was broughtto the hospital by ambulance. There was a history of restrainingor taking out by the wife against the patient , and she reportedfeeling unsafe with him from the home. Psychiatry did see thepatient and felt that he was unreliable and was probably not safeto go home to take care of himself , but that he was alsoconfident to make decisions and was not acutely psychotic , andtherefore , it should not be committed against his will. Thepatient denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. The patientwas started on SSRI and initially on Zyprexa though this wasstopped because of prolonged QTC. After a few days , the patient'family changed their mind and decided that they would be okaywith him coming home. The situation was discussed with thepatient's primary doctor , with the family over the phone , as theywould not come in for a family meeting with the patient and hedid go home , but will likely require a psych follow up as anoutpatient.6. Endocrine: The patient continued on insulin and RegularInsulin sliding scale for his history of diabetes.7. Infectious disease: The patient developed a low bloodpressure and was noted to have erythema and pus from the site ofhis hemodialysis catheter in the right subclavian position. Hebecame fully hypertensive and required a brief course of pressorsto maintain blood pressure. The catheter was removed andcultures were obtained that demonstrated methicillin-resistantStaph aureus. The patient was treated with vancomycin andgentamicin dose to his renal function and showed improvement inhis symptoms in clearance of his bacteremia. The gentamicin wasstopped and plans were made for the patient to receive vancomycinas an outpatient and hemodialysis in follow up. He was dialyzedfrom VAF fistula in his arm that had been created a number ofmonths prior to this admission.8. Nutrition: The patient was seen by nutrition and was given arenal carbohydrate controlled low fat low cholesterol diet. Hewas continued on Nephrocaps. B12 and folate were normal.eScription document: 4-8128309 EMSSten TelDictated By: SVOBODNY , TERRYAttending: MCDANIAL , RICKIEDictation ID 6569037D: 11/3/04T: 11/3/04

She has a history ofhypertension , borderline diabetes mellitus , hiatal hernia , andumbilical hernia. Patient went to sleep on the night ofpresentation with mild pain and awoke in the middle of the nightwith more severe pain. The pain was intermittent and came in wavesapproximately every three to five minutes , somewhat positional , andworse with lying or standing. She denied shortness of breath andshe said her last bowel movement was earlier on the evening ofpresentation which the patient reported as normal in consistency.She denied bright red blood per rectum and she denied any urinarytract symptoms. She also denied any gynecological/vaginalsymptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for: 1 ) Umbilicalhernia/ventral hernia. 2 ) Hiatal hernia. 3 ) Bilateral tuballigation. 4 ) Left lower extremity venous insufficiency. 5 )Hypertension. 6 ) Borderline diabetes mellitus. CURRENTMEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile , heart rate was 76 , bloodpressure of 160/100 , and room air saturationof 89%. GENERAL: She was an obese black female in moderatedistress. HEENT: Anicteric and 2+ carotid pulses with no bruits.CHEST: Had distant lung sounds. CARDIAC: Examination was regularwith a I/VI systolic ejection murmur. ABDOMEN: Examination waslarge and obese with a ventral supraumbilical hernia with anindistinct fascial edge , partially reduced but possibly with asecond aspect just above the umbilical hernia , a 5-6 cm mass whichwas non-reducible , faint bowel sounds with diffuse tenderness.RECTAL: She was noted to be guaiac negative on rectal examinationand non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Examination was warm and atraumatic.Of note , she had 2+ palpable dorsalis pedis pulses and herposterior tibial pulses were not palpable. Her left calf wastender which the patient reported to be chronic and her entire calfwas firm with no cords palpable. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination wasnon-focal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm , leftatrial enlargement , question of poor Rwave progression , no ST or T wave changes , and her chest X-Ray wasclear with no active disease. Her KUB showed the nasogastric tubein place with few air filled loops of small bowel and there was airand stool in the large bowel. Her laboratories on admission werenotable for an SMA 7 showing a sodium of 141 , potassium of 3.9 ,chloride 95 , carbon dioxide 32 , BUN 9 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose of222 , amylase of 33 , her lipase was 10 , white blood cell count was7.8 , her hematocrit was 53.4 , and platelets were 198.HOSPITAL COURSE: A nasogastric tube was placed and drained 500 ccof aspirate after 500 cc of emesis. She wasadmitted with a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction with threesupraumbilical reducible hernias and one periumbilical incarceratedhernia. The plan was to take her to the Operating Room for ventralhernia repair. On 10/1 , she was taken to the Operating Room andhad a ventral hernia repair. That operation was notable to be areducible umbilical hernia which was noted to be incarceratedwithout any evidence of strangulation. The hernia was repairedwith Marlex and mesh. Please see the Operative Note for details.The patient remained intubated after the operation and was taken tothe Recovery Room intubated. After a slow wean from theventilator , the patient was extubated later in the day on September and required four liters of oxygen by nasal prongs to maintainO2 saturations between 90 and 94%. She also underwent a rule outmyocardial infarction protocol post-operatively and did rule out.Of note , the right calf had a palpable cord , lower extremitynon-invasives were scheduled , and the Cardiology Deep VenousThrombosis Service was consulted. They felt that her left lowerextremity deep venous thrombosis was chronic deep venous thrombosisand venous insufficiency. They recommended Ted stockings andsubcutaneous Heparin. She was additionally seen by the PulmonaryService who suggested getting pulmonary function tests once thepatient was clinically stable and agreed to using Ted thigh-highstockings. The Deep Venous Thrombosis Service recommendedthigh-high stockings with the pressure of 30 to 40 mm of mercuryduring the day with Ted stockings regularly at night with thecontinuation of subcutaneous Heparin until fully mobile. Onpost-operative day three , the patient's nasogastric tube wasdiscontinued and her diet was advanced. Her Jackson-Pratt drainwas removed. On post-operative day four , the patient had regainedbowel sounds as well as had a bowel movement. Her oxygensaturation was 94% on four liters and when the oxygen was removed ,she had a room air saturation between 86 and 88%. She had anechocardiogram to rule out evidence of pulmonary hypertension inthe setting of sleep apnea felt the most likely diagnosis in thispickwickian appearing patient. Her echo was without evidence ofpulmonary hypertension. Her pulmonary function tests showeddecreased volume , decreased diffusing capacity , and decreased MIP.The Respiratory Service recommended home oxygen therapy to maintainsaturations at 90% at rest and with ambulation. A trial of oxygenat rest and with ambulation was done in the hospital to calculatethe dose of oxygen needed for home therapy. Pulmonary as wellrecommended state study as an out-patient and pulmonary follow-up.On post-operative day five , the patient was noted to have erythemaaround her incision , probably a reaction to the tape , however , she ,as well , had a low grade temperature to 100.1. Given that she hadhad a mesh placed , she was started on antibiotic prophylaxis forpossible cellulitis. She was started on Cephradine 500 q.i.d. forseven days. As well , further discussion was had with theRespiratory Consultation Service. They felt that patient's problemwas chronic with hypoxemia leading to an elevated hematocrit andthat she would require home oxygen. The Deep Venous ThrombosisCardiology Service recommended repeating her lower extremitynon-invasives prior to discharge , continuing her on her 30 to 40 mmof mercury stockings during the day , and Teds at night. She had afollow-up lower extremity non-invasive on the day of dischargewhich showed a chronic left lower extremity deep venous thrombosiswith venous insufficiency and no evidence of new deep venousthrombosis. They recommended follow-up lower extremitynon-invasives after discharge as an out-patient. The patient wasdischarged in good condition on June , 1994. She isdischarged on home oxygen at two liters by nasal prongs. Withthis , she was able to maintain her O2 saturations greater than 90%.On the date of discharge , her saturations were in the 94percentile. She was to be monitored by Stuartmer Medical Center at home.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylox one to two tabletsq.3-4h. p.r.n. for pain , Colace , Dulcolax p.r.n. , andCephradine 500 q.i.d. for six days further.

He had a questionable seizure earlier inthe day per history. During the dialysis , he became increasinglyconfused and was sent for further evaluation to the Sidecoa Medical Center Emergency Room. At the Cleavexo Brock Hospital ED , an EKG was done ,which showed tachycardia going in to torsade de pointes followedby ventricular fibrillation. He underwent a DC cardioversionshock at 200 joules and was converted to normal sinus rhythm.The patient was then intubated , as he was being coded.Furthermore , there is report of the patient developing atonic-clonic seizure during the bagging phase of intubation.Follow this , a repeat EKG was obtained and showed a QT intervalof 540. His baseline is apparently around 510 milliseconds. Hiselectrolytes at that time were remarkable for potassium of 3.7 ,bicarbonate of 30 , and magnesium level of 1.6 , and phosphatelevel of 0.9. He did have a slightly elevated troponin level.He was then transferred to the Centrah Steadmot Ain Medical Center forfurther workup and management. On arrival , the patient wasintubated , sedated , with an amiodarone drip.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Diabetes mellitus , insulin dependent.2. End-stage renal disease with hemodialysis , on Monday ,Wednesday , and Friday.3. CAD , status post a non-ST elevation MI in 6/29 .4. A long QT syndrome.5. Seizure disorder.6. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy complicated by gastritis.7. Chronic pancreatitis.8. History of mental status changes with increased ICP.9. Peripheral neuropathy.10. Peripheral vascular disease.11. Penile amputation secondary to infected implant.12. Depression.13. Hep B and hep C positive.ALLERGIES:Tetracycline.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:The patient was noted to be afebrile. His blood pressure wasnotable to be 240/79 and heart rate of 72. He was intubated onarrival on assist-control volume setting with the tidal volume of500 mL , 12 beats per minute , on 50% oxygen. He was saturating100% on room air. Pulmonary exam was notable for mechanicalbreath sounds without any wheezes , rhonchi or rales.Cardiovascular exam was notable for regular rate and rhythm , soft2/6 holosystolic murmur heard loudest at the apex , and 2+ pulsesdistally. His abdominal exam was unremarkable. Extremity examwas notable for status post left leg below-the-knee amputation.Neurologically , the patient was unresponsive secondary tosedation , but was able to move all extremities when the sedationwas decreased. He did responded ??_____?? purposefully to pain.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:1. Torsade de pointes status post DC cardioversion: Given hishistory of torsade de pointes requiring cardioversion , uponpresentation to Neysing Areid Risbanks Hospital , Mr. Mazikowskielectrolytes were vigorously repleted. He underwent an ischemicworkup for the etiology for his initial presentation. Hecontinued to have a prolonged QT interval and therefore medicatedfailed to exacerbate his already long QT interval , at baselinewere discontinued. He was discontinued from his Celexa andlevofloxacin. Throughout the remainder of his hospital course ,Mr. Gift was closely monitored via telemetry and was noted tohave no further events of ventricular tachycardia.2. Ischemia: When he presented , the ischemic etiology for hisventricular tachycardia was considered. He was maintained onaspirin and also continued on his Plavix. A cardiaccatheterization was done on 7/24/05 , which showed 30% occlusionof the left anterior descending proximal coronary artery , 65%occlusion of the ramus , 30% occlusion of the mid circumflexartery , 50% occlusion of the marginal 1 artery , and 100%occlusion of the distal RCA. None of these lesions were felt tohave caused his ischemia such that it would have been theetiological factor for his torsades. He was followed throughouthis hospital course by the Electrophysiology Service.3. Hypertension: While in the CCU , the patient had an echo ,which showed severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy withan ejection fraction of 55%. He was started on vigorousafter-load reduction , which was titrated to his blood pressurethroughout his hospital course. At the time of discharge , he wastaking Lopressor , lisinopril , Norvasc , Isordil , and hydralazine.4. End-stage renal disease: The patient was continued on hisrepeat dialysis with close follow up from the Renal Service. Heunderwent regular dialysis on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday whileat Apseph's Danale Hospital .  His electrolytes were followeddaily and repleted as needed.5. Seizure disorder: The patient , although on presentation wasbelieved to have had a tonic-clonic seizure. He was maintainedon his Keppra throughout his course and was seizure-free whilehospitalized.6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient presented with markedlylabile blood sugars. While admitted to the CCU , he was placed onthe Portland protocol in order to maintain tight glycemiccontrol. He was followed by the Endocrine Team , who recommendedswitch to Lantus for basal control and regular insulin prior tomeals. His glucose levels were followed daily and his insulinregimen was titrated in order to attain appropriate glycemiccontrol.7. Nutrition: The patient was initially started on tube feedsfor nutrition. A NG tube was placed secondary to his alteredmental status. However , during his hospitalization , he hadmultiple episodes of agitations , during which he pulled out hisNG tube. He was trialed with a soft diet after consultation withthe Speech and Swallow Service on 2/1 .  As he was able totolerate these p.o. feeds , this diet was continued.COMPLICATIONS:None.CONSULTANTS:1.

Hematocrit on November , 1997 ,was 29.3. Cholesterol total was 258; LDH 43; LDL 166.HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Talburt was admitted for a rule out myocardialinfarction protocol and underwent serialelectrocardiograms and her enzymes were studied. She was startedon Nitrol paste. Aspirin , linsinopril , and atenolol , werecontinued. Given her low hematocrit as a possible etiology forher ischemia , she was transfused with one unit of packed red cells.Stools were guaiac neg and anemia workup was initiated. She wascontinued on her albuterol inhale and nebulizers p.r.n.On February , 1997 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterizationwhich showed a 70% residual osteal diagonal stenosis , 0% leftanterior descending stenosis. A stent was placed in the diagonalartery with 0% residual stenosis. Later than evening , the patientbegan to complain of severe left arm pain radiating to her leftchest. Her electrocardiogram changes showed ST elevation in VI andVII , and T-wave more inverted in VIV. She received morphine andwas already on a nitroglycerin drip , and she was taken back to thecatheterization laboratory. Her spectral study on February ,1997 , revealed a 90% mid left anterior descending and 95% VI , andher left anterior descending was stented at this time.Following her two cardiac catheterizations , she experiencedintermittent atypical chest which was transient in nature withoutsustaining any electrocardiogram changes. Her cardiac enzymes weresignificant for a CK of 409 with an MB fraction o 21.On October , 1997 , it was noted that her creatinine had risen to3.1 , elevated from a level of 1.9 before the catheterization and adiagnosis of radial contrast induced nephrotoxicity was made. Hercreatinine rose and rose to a peak level of 5.1 on May ,1997 , and then began to decrease. At the time of discharge , it wasdown to 2.2. The patient continued to have excellent urine outputthroughout the rise in her creatinine and was normal by the time ofdischarge.Her laboratories at the time of discharge were a sodium of 141;potassium 4.8; chloride 106; bicarbonate 20; BUN 31; creatinine2.2; glucose 90.

ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT2. PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY3. DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE4. UMBILICAL HERNIAHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Dorich is a 66-year-old righthanded gentleman with no previousadmissions to Tiftver Community , who presented on27 of June , after having fallen out of bed at about 5:45 in themorning. He was noted to be mute at the time and was unable tomove the right arm and leg. He was brought by ambulance to theEmergency Room , where much of his motor deficits resolved , as wellas some of his speech deficit. This occurred within an hour.There was no loss of consciousness associated with the fall , andthe patient was not noted to have any unusual movements orverbalizations , or tongue biting , or incontinence. He was"stunned" for a minute ( by the report of his son ) just afterfalling. The patient denied headaches , vertigo , double vision ,hoarseness or numbness , or nausea , vomiting , or palpitations. Hehad had no previous neurological symptoms prior to this event.There was also no chest pain. There was no history of high bloodpressure or heart disease , or recent fever and chills or sweats.He had been feeling quite well up until this point. PAST MEDICALHISTORY: Significant for an umbilical hernia , which had beenpresent for many years. He also suffered from prostatism. In thelast year , he had regained much of the weight that he had lostprevious on special diet. SOCIAL HISTORY: He did not smoke nordid he use alcohol or elicit drugs. There was no significantfamily history of heart disease or strokes.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a severely obese gentlemen ,who had a blood pressure of 115/59 in theright arm; with a respiratory rate of 12; heart rate of 72. He wasafebrile. HEENT: Remarkable for a slight bruise on the righttemple where the patient hit his head during the fall. The neckshowed no signs of meningismus. The carotids were poorly palpatedsecondary to the thickness of his neck. The cardiovascularexamination revealed regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs orrubs. There were no bruits. The lungs were clear. The abdomenrevealed umbilical hernia , but was otherwise benign. Theextremities had full pulses throughout , and a trace of edema.There was no calf tenderness noted. On neurological examination ,the patient was oriented x 3. He was now able to speak , and wasquite alert. He could register 3 words forward and 2 wordsbackwards. He could count from 20 to 1. His language was abnormalwith waxing and weaning worsening of functions. His meaning wasclear , but he did make errors , calling a pen and pencil. Hisspeech was mostly fluent but there were quite a few paraphasias.There was decreased comprehension and decreased repetitions andthere was one prominent error in reading in which he repeatedlyread the "leaf" as "deaf". There was no right/left confusion , andthe patient was able to write. There was no neglect noted.Long-term memory was essentially intact and there were a few errorswith short term tasks. Cranial nerve examination revealed fullvisual fields to confrontation with sharp discs and no evidence ofcholesterol emboli. The discs were sharp. The pupils equal roundand reactive to light and accommodation. Conjugate eye movementsin all directions. There was full sensation on the face to pinprick. There was a slight decrease nasal labial fold on the rightand some decreased hearing on the right. The palate moved upwardbilaterally and the sternocleidomastoid was strong. The tongueprotruded to the midline. Motor examination revealed normal tonethroughout and to formal testing the patient had 5/5 power in allextremities except the right iliopsoas which demonstrated 5-/5power. There was mild right sided drift of the upper extremities.The patient had sensory decrease to vibration on the right lowerextremity. Pin prick and light touch were within normal limits , aswas joint position sense. The patient was mildly uncoordinatedwith slowing of rapid alternating movements in the right upperextremity. There was normal finger-nose-finger maneuver andheel-knee-shin maneuvers in both the upper and lower extremitiesbilaterally. The gait was not assessed initially ( but during therest of the hospital course , was noted to be quite normal ).LABORATORY DATA: The patient had fully normal electrolytes with aglucose of 105; sodium 139; potassium 4.4; whitecount 7.5; hemoglobin 13.5; hematocrit 39.8; platelets 225; PT andPTT were 12.6 and 28.4 respectively; calcium was normal. Liverfunction tests were normal. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm withoutany signs of ischemia. Carotid ultrasounds were done immediately ,and the patient was noted to have normal carotids withoutsignificant stenosis. A CT scan was obtained without contrast ,showing evidence of an early left frontal parietal infarction onthe left. There was no evidence of hemorrhage , and there was nomass effect noted.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Neurology Serviceand was started on Heparin , as it was felt thathis event had most likely been an embolic event. During the firstday , his speech waxed and wained , and by 2 of the hospitalization ,his speech was clearly abnormal with marked deficits in speechgeneration with many pauses and profound word finding difficulty.Repetition and comprehension were somewhat better than the initialpresentation. A repeat CT scan was obtained showing no evidencefor bleeding. This CT scan , now 3 days from the initial event ,showed an acute infarct in the posterior inferior left frontal lobeand posterior temporal lobe , and extending into the sylvianfissure. Again , there was no evidence of hemorrhage or masseffect , and the patient was continued on Heparin.Because the patient was unable to fit into the MRI scanner atVaplacea Memorial Medical Center , he had a diagnostic MRI done at theSkilli Memorial Health Center , and this revealed , in addition to the originallesion noted on CT scan , a second lesion , corresponding with anocclusion of the posterior division of the middle cerebral artery.This lesion was in the left parietal region. By the end of thehospitalization , the patient's aphasia was quite clearly a verymixed aphasia , with elements of poor comprehension , as well asdifficulties with fluency.An investigation as to the cause of the patient's stroke wasinitiated with an MR angiogram of the cerebral vasculature , whichrevealed no significant carotid or posterior circulation defects.An echocardiogram was done revealing normal ventricular functionwith an ejection fraction of 55% without any wall motionabnormality or thrombi noted. It was felt that the patient'spresentation warranted further review , and a transesophagealechocardiogram was also done revealing an atrial septal defect , asevidenced by significant positive bubble study. The patient wastherefore started on Coumadin. While the workup was being done ,the patient also had an EEG that revealed abnormality consistentwith the 2 infarcts noted on MRI. These were not felt , however , tobe definite seizure phenomena. Coagulation studies were doneshowing normal cardiolipin. Protein C was slightly elevatedprotein S , a normal ANA , and a sed rate that was slightly elevatedat 26.The patient was seen by the Speech Pathologist , and therapy wasbegun , and this will continue as an outpatient.The patient continued to have difficulties with voiding , with apost void residual of 450 after voiding 400. He was seen by theUrologist and was noted to have a quite large prostate. The PSAwas 14.6. The patient opted not to have surgical interventionduring this hospitalization or in near future. He was started onCardura at 1 mg q hs , which was slowly increased to 4 mg q hs , asmedical intervention for decreasing sphincter tone.The patient also had some mild pain in the left knee with minimaleffusion , that was noted by x-ray. There was no evidence forfracture. There was a small increase in his uric acid. Heresponded quite nicely to Ibuprofen.After day 3 , the patient's speech stabilized and graduallyimproved , all be it very , very , slowly. He was therapeutic on hisCoumadin at the time of discharge , with his hopes that his INR willbe in the mid 2 range ( 2.3-2.8 ).MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1. Cardura 2 mg po q hs x 2 nights ,then 4 mg po q hs every nightthereafter. 2. Coumadin 5.0 mg q hs to be monitored and adjustedas needed in the near future. FOLLOW-UP CARE: The patient wasdischarged in good condition to his home with the followingfollow-up appointments: 1. Primary M.D. , Dr. Giovanni Behanna , at theON PHPU VALLEY HEALTH Clinic on 29 of October , at 10:20 am. 2. Dr. Maendel at theUrology Clinic on 30 of January , at 3:30 pm. 3. Dr. Matthew Prokup inthe Neurology Clinic on 21 of November , at 2:00 pm. 4. The patient willcontinued to receive speech therapy at his home through thevisiting nurses association.

In the prior 2 weeks , he had been started onhydrochlorothiazide. He had been nauseated and vomiting as aresult of Percocet taken for his left hip pain with resultingdecreased p.o. intake. He was evaluated in his primary careclinic and felt to be in decompensated heart failure.In the Emergency Department , he was dehydrated and found to be inacute renal failure , hyperkalemic , and uremic. He complained ofjoint soreness , particularly in his third proximalinterphalangeal joints bilaterally. His BUN and creatinine were182 and 4.8 respectively. His potassium 6.4 , his sodium 128 , andhis CPK 1356 , and his uric acid level 11.6. Issues in thehospital included hyperkalemia , acute renal failure secondary todehydration , polyarticular joint soreness and left hip pain. Forhis hyperkalemia , the patient was treated with calcium ,gluconate , insulin , Kayexalate and his potassium level returnedto normal levels by hospital day #2. For his acute renalfailure , the patient was hydrated gently with 60 cc of normalsaline. The renal service was consulted and assisted withmanagement. The patient was urinating. Renal ultrasound wasnormal. Renal function returned to baseline and his creatinineat discharge was 1.4. His baseline is 1.6. With correction ofhis renal function , the patient regained strength. For his jointsymptoms , Rheumatology was consulted who performed arthrocentesisof the left knee and diagnosed polyarticular gout. No treatmentwas initiated in the setting of impaired renal function and aconcern for fluid retention. He has a followup appointment withRheumatology in September 2005. For his hip pain , his orthopedist ,Dr. Schuchmann , evaluated him for possible future hip surgery.Neurology was consulted regarding atrophy of thenar muscles andelevated CPK. They did not feel a secure diagnosis could be madeand recommended following daily CPK , which trended down over thecourse of hospitalization. Followup appointment in Neurology wasscheduled to discuss essential tremor and further investigate themuscle wasting with nerve conduction studies and EMG if necessarybased on CPK levels. The patient had an echocardiogram onhospital day #2 , which showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45% ,no pericardial effusion , and hypokinesis of the mid and distalseptum , mid and distal inferior wall and decreased global rightventricular function. The patent foramen ovale was visualized.At discharge , the patient was afebrile , hemodynamically stable ,euvolemic , ambulating , and saturating on room air , and on astable medical regimen. He was followed by VNA at home startingFebruary , 2005 , for INR checks.Followup appointments for Cardiology , Neurology , and Rheumatologywere put in place. The patient was asked to contact his primarycare physician to schedule a followup appointment.On admission , the patient was afebrile and hemodynamicallystable.eScription document: 2-5278415 SSSten TelDictated By: PIERMONT , FLOYDAttending: SULESKI , CHADWICK ANTONIODictation ID 1575699D: 1/12/05T: 1/12/05

He was taken to angiographyat which time tPA infusion was commenced. He is most recentlystatus post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft in July of2001 and has noticed that , in the past two to three weeks , has beendeveloping increasing rest pain and coolness to the left foot tothe point where he was not able to ambulate. In angiography , hewas found to have an occlusion of the left lower extremity veingraft in the area of the mid-thigh with no passage of contrast andminimal reconstitution of collaterals to his foot.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Peripheral vascular disease. Myocardialinfarction. Hypertension. Non-insulindependent diabetes mellitus. Aortic stenosis. He is status post aleft femoral to peroneal bypass graft in July of 2001. A revisionwith cephalic vein to dorsalis pedis in July of 2001. He isstatus post a right femoral to peroneal in September of 2000 and a rightfourth toe amputation in September of 2000.MEDICATIONS: Glipizide 5 mg b.i.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mgq.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg q.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg q.d. ,Amlodipine 5 mg q.d. , Imdur 30 mg q.d. , and Toprol 100 mg q.d. andenteric coated aspirin.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient first underwent angiography at whichtime they found that the vein graft was occluded.He underwent tPA treatment and was brought back to angiography.This time they did not find necessarily any improvement. Theconduit actually opened but it was found that he does have a highgrade anastomotic stricture of the distal anastomosis. He wastaken to the operating room on 10/23/01 for a left lower extremitythrombectomy via groin and foot cutdown. Status post thatprocedure he developed symptoms of acute chest pain andhypotension. An ECG was performed , as well as troponin drawn ,revealing that he has an acute myocardial infarction. Thecardiology service was called and the patient was admittedpost-thrombectomy to the cardiac care unit. At that time he wasmanaged medically for a few days. Based on his severe aorticstenosis and difficulty in managing his blood pressure , the cardiacsurgery service was consulted. He was scheduled to see cardiacsurgery in office setting but , given his current condition , we weregoing to perform his surgery a little bit sooner. He did have about of pneumonia which mildly delayed his surgery.On 1/18/02 he underwent catheterization which revealed a rightdominant system , a discreet 40% lesion in the proximal left main , adiscreet 30% lesion in the proximal left anterior descendingartery , 100% lesion in the first marginal branch of the leftcircumflex artery , as well as 100% lesion in the second marginalbranch of the left circumflex artery. He has a discreet 80% lesionin the proximal right coronary artery , as well as evidence ofsevere aortic stenosis. During catheterization this revealed an RApressure of 10 , a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/20 , with wedge of31. He had a thick cardiac output of 4.77 and cardiac index of2.1.Based on the findings of these catheterization results , the patientwas taken to the operating room on 2/13/02 with Dr. Opfer and Dr.Gack for an aortic valve replacement with a #23Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve and mitral valvuloplasty withan Alfieri suture repair , as well as coronary artery bypass grafttimes three with left internal mammary artery to the left anteriordescending artery , left radial to obtuse marginal one , and leftradial to posterior descending artery. Postoperatively heunderwent our routine care and went to the Cardiac SurgicalIntensive Care Unit where he generally did well.He remained on his aspirin and Lopressor , as well as Coumadin. Hewas mildly tachycardic and his Lopressor dose was adjusted.Because of his diabetes mellitus , he was placed on the Portlandprotocol and remained on a full ten-day course of Flagyl andCefotaxime for his preoperative pneumonia. On postoperative day #1he was transferred to the floor where he did well and was able toambulate at least to a chair and was deemed that he probably is nota candidate to go home immediately but a candidate forrehabilitation. He has been taken off his Portland protocol andhis staples have been discontinued.On his pre-discharge examination he is stable with clean incisions ,as well as stable sternum. He is now currently on room air andwill be discharged to rehabilitation.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.hs tomaintain INR between 2 and 3 , aspirin , Diltiazem 30mg t.i.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg q.d. , Colace 100 mg t.i.d. , Nexium 20mg q.d. , Niferex-150 b.i.d. , Glipizide 5 mg b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mgb.i.d. , and Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. with CZI sliding scale.Dictated By: MYRON MANCUSI , M.D. ET72Attending: HORACIO D.

On the day of admission , thepatient took an extra dose of Lasix because he thought that hemight be fluid overloade. In the emergency room , it was thoughtthat he appeared dry and he was admitted for volumeresuscitation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , silent MI in1998 , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease with GIbleed , severe anxiety , cardiomyopathy with ejection fractionpreviously reported at 20% in October 2005 , 2+ mitralregurgitation , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 20 mg to 40 mg daily , aspirin325 daily , Lipitor 5 mg daily , Toprol XL 25 daily , Valium 5 mgt.i.d. p.r.n. , Accupril 5 mg daily and Aleve p.r.n.ALLERGIES: Sulfa causes rash and ciprofloxacin causeshallucinations.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an Irish descendent. He livesalone with many cats. Drinks occasional ethanol , no tobacco orillicit drugs. He is retired.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 95.6 , heart rate 112 ,blood pressure 153/90 with orthostasis , respiratory rate 18 , 97%oxygen on room air. General: No acute distress , alert. Pupilsare equal , round and reactive to light and accommodationbilaterally. Extraocular motor intact. His oropharynx is clear.Dry mucous membranes. Neck: Supple , JVP flat. Lungs: Clearto auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Tachycardic with occasionalpremature heartbeats. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen:Nondistended , soft and nontender. Positive bowel sounds.Extremities: No edema , clubbing , or cyanosis. Neuro: Thepatient was oriented. Cranial nerves III through XII intact.Strength is 5/5 throughout. The sensation was intact throughout.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Cardiovascular: Upon admission , the patient appeared dry andwas resuscitated with one liter of IV fluids. The patient'sLasix was held initially on admission. On hospital day #2 , hewas looking well. His weight was 151 pounds which was suspectedto be close to his dry weight which was reportedly 149 pounds.By 8/18/05 , he was restarted on 20 mg of Lasix daily so that he would stayeuvolemic. He received intermittent IV Lasix ( 20mg ) throughout the remainderof his hospitalization and his p.o. Lasix dose was settled on 40 mg p.o.daily. His captopril was restarted on the 9/19/05 at 6.25 mg t.i.d. Hetolerated that dose and was switched to Accupril 2.5 mg b.i.d. He underwent anechocardiogram on 11/9/05 which demonstrated possible vegetationon the tricuspid valve verus a flail leaflet. This question of avegetation raised concern for possible endocarditis and bloodculture were sent. The patient's temperature had been low onadmission , since there was some concern that he could bedeveloping sepsis , however nothing grew from the blood culturesthroughout the remainder of his hospitalization. He was seen byCardiology , who did not think that this echo result requiredfurther intervention and suspected that it represented a flailtricuspid valve leaflet. The patient's troponinOne troponin level was elevated at 0.11 initially and thenanother troponin was elevated on 10/27/05 in the setting ARF andacute hepatitis. He recently had a negative stress echo at theLaketon Medical Center , so no additional stress testingwas pursued during this admission. He was switched to Lopressor25 t.i.d. and then switched back to Toprol XL. His statin wasdiscontinued during the admission because of LFT abnormalitieswhich will be discussed below. He was monitored on telemetrywhich demonstrated frequent PVCs and some NSVT. Thisshould be readdressed in Cardiology Clinic. Cardiology decided to hold off onplacing an AICD and was to see him as an outpt.2. GI/renal: On the morning of 10/27/05 , the patient developed new confusionand delirium. He also developed an oxygenrequirement the night before. His labs on morning were notablefor a transaminitis in the thousands , acute renal failure withhyperkalemia and acidemia with bicarbonate of 13 , and a new leukocytosis ( WBC 9to 25 ). He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including coverage forbartonella as he had many cats. He was empirically started on mucomyst andacyclovir as per GI in case his LFT abnormalities were due to tylenoltoxicity or HSV. He was initially going to get a liver biopsy but this wascancelled as his LFTs started to normalize. He had a RUQ with dopplers whichwas negative. The etiology of his hepatitis , renal failure and leukocytosis wasnever identified throughout the admission. Cardiology did not think that anyof this could be explained by endocarditis and his antibiotics were stoppedonce his cultures were negative for multiple days. GI though he could of hadshock liver but he was on telemetry the entire time. His tylenol level wasnormal and his hep seriologies were negative. His labs had all normalized byadmission except for his LFTs which were still trending downward.3. Infectious disease: Due to low temperature and question ofvegetation , there was consideration for endocarditis and sepsisalthough that never panned out. He has a history of feedingstray cats and so bartonella cultures were sent. They take along time to come back and should be followed up as outpatient. He had beenplaced on antibiotics while awaiting cultures but those were discontinued onthe 8/18/05 as the microbiology data remains negative. He had a CT scan of hischest and abdomen which did not reveal any infectious source. He had groundglass opacities on his CT chest which were felt to be due to CHF when reviewedwith the radiologist. He remained afebrile during the admission.4. Psych: Early on during the patient's admission , he did haveseveral episodes of tachypnea at rest. They were not positional in natureand resolved with verbal consolation and redirection anddeep breath. No associated desaturation at that time. Thepatient has a history of anxiety and reported that that promptedhim to increase his Lasix dose at home. He refused psychiatricconsultation or social work involvement. His Valium hadinitially been initiated but it was held in the setting ofabnormal LFTs. He had no further anxiety attacks after that. Itis likely that he has mild baseline dementia. His deliriumresolved after the acute renal failure and transaminitis resolved.5. Musculoskeletal: The patient had a little bit of difficultyambulating and was seen by Physical Therapy who did think thatfurther physical therapy would be appropriate. The patientrefused to go to rehabilitation facility , so he was planning togo home with services including physical therapy at home.6. Hematology: The patient was set to go home and then it wasnoted that his platelets had taken a slow and steady declinethroughout his hospitalization while he was on heparin/Lovenox. Therewas concern that this could represent heparin inducedthrombocytopenia and so all heparin products were stopped. He was placedlepirudin which was chosen instead of Argatroban becauseArgatroban was cleared by liver in light of his hepatitis.His initial PF4 was read as bordeline positive , but the laber laterchanged the result to negative. Based on this discrepancy another PF4 wassent which was borderline positive. As per the hematology consult , they feltthat despite the borderline positive PF4 he did not need prophylacticanticoagulation and that he should refrain from heparin products in thefuture until a repeat PF4 in checked in a few months.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg daily ,Toprol XL 25 mg daily , Accupril 5 mg daily , omeprazole 20 mgdaily.DIET: Low sodium.ACTIVITY: As tolerated with supervision and advised by thephysical therapist.FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Dougall is the patient's new PCP atthe GHAM MILL RIDOWN MEDICAL CENTER clinic at the Atl Hospital , he has anappointment for 3/23/05 at 9:45 a.m. and an appointment with Dr.Alquisira was made from Cardiology 10/21/05 at 2:45 p.m.ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Do not take Valium or Lipitor until youare cleared by your doctor to do so due to liver function. Weighyourself daily and keep a record and bring that to follow upappointment. If you develop light headedness , shortness ofbreath , chest pain or any other symptoms you are concerned about ,call your doctor or return to the Pi Hospital emergency room for evaluation.LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE: Glucose 90 , BUN 18 , creatinine1.2 , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 28 , ALT 159 ,AST 54 , alkaline phosphatase 118 , bilirubin total 1.5 , albumin3.3 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 1.9 , white blood cell count 7.79 ,hemoglobin 14.3 , hematocrit 44 , platelet 199 , INR 1.3 , PTT 42.2 ,PF4 pending.

He also had an elevated white blood cell countduring the transaminitis and renal failure up to 28. Final bloodculture , no growth from anaerobic medium. Urine culture , nogrowth. HCV viral load of less than 615.RADIOLOGIC DATA: Ultrasound of the abdomen showed no evidence ofportal vein thrombosis. Portable chest x-ray on 10/27/05 showedthe lung volumes considerably decreased from the previous exam on9/29/05 .  There is hazy opacity in the lower lung soundsparticularly on the right suggesting mild edema. There alsoappears to be small right effusion , mild cardiomegaly is againnoted. On 10/27/05 , CAT scan of the abdomen showed no apparentsource of infection , no collection or abscess , limited studysecondary to lack of IV contrast , mild ascites , bilateral pleuraleffusions right greater than left with subsegmental atelectasis ,presacral edema and cardiomegaly with left coronary arterycalcification. CAT scan of the chest on 10/27/05 showedbilateral small pleural effusion , evidence of pulmonary edema andsmall volume ascites associated with cardiomegaly , nodular groundglass opacities at the right base may be due to atelectasis butsomewhat discrete , cannot exclude septic emboli but would be verylocalized.

Was unable to do muchambulation and was not able to cook with low salt foods as a resultof her immobility. She says the swelling then occurred. Sheattempted to increase the level of diuretics that she takes athome , which has not helped , and now present with some mild chestpain and congestive heart failure.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for 20years , hypertension not well controlled ,coronary artery disease , status post inferior myocardial infarction1986 , peripheral neuropathy , retinopathy , nephropathy , mildcongestive heart failure , possible pneumonia in the past , andmitral insufficiency.MEDICATIONS: Elavil 50 milligrams , aspirin 325 milligrams ,Atenolol 50 milligrams b.i.d. , Lasix 40 milligramsp.o. q.d. , insulin , lactulose 30 milliliters q.i.d. , Prilosec 20milligrams p.o. q.i.d. , Zocor 20 milligrams p.o. q.h.s. ,lisinopril , Tiazac 180 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. , Cozaar 50 milligramsp.o. b.i.d.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , ruled out for anmyocardial infarction , and began diuresis.Required 80 milligrams intravenous Lasix , then to twice a day , andincrease that to 100 , and then 200 intravenous Lasix twice a dayand added 500 milligrams of Diuril twice a day. The patient beganto respond to the initial diuresis. Was unable to obtain an MRI toevaluate her renal arteries , secondary to claustrophobia andorthopnea. On July required addition of clonidine for notwell controlled blood pressure into the 180s and 190s/100 , .Changed Captopril to ramipril for better lipophilic absorption. OnJuly Lasix was increased and Clonidine was also increasedfrom 2.5 to 5 for better diuresis and blood pressure control. Thepatient was noted to have a hyperproliferative normal MCV anemia ,was begun on erythropoietin; however , her level came back to 15which is normal limits. An echocardiogram in October 2000 showed anejection fraction of 60% , normal size and function , 2-3+ mitralregurgitation. A repeat echocardiogram done on Aprilshowed 4+ mitral regurgitation with decreased function and anejection fraction of 45-50%. The patient had a chest x-ray thatshowed continued pleural effusions and pulmonary edema , compared toadmission , somewhat improved. Sputum was done and had a gram stainshowing 4+ polys , gram positive cocci in clusters and chains , and aculture which had 1+ oral flora. On March the patientcontinued to diuresis well.

As family felt he was at his baseline in terms ofshortness of breath and he was started on prednisone anddischarged on a Combivent inhaler. The morning of admission thepatient was in the bathroom using the toilet when he fell and hada loss of consciousness of several minutes , .per patient'sgirlfriend. The patient did not remember the event. When seenin the ED his vitals were: Temperature 99.9 , heart rate 91 ,respirations 36 , BP 132/61 , oxygen saturation 89% on room airwhich improved to 97% on 3 liters. The patient was treated withlevofloxacin and clindamycin and had a chest xray showing a leftlower lobe opacity. At baseline the patient does not use oxygen.He can walk approximately 50 yards on a flat surface withoutbeing limited by shortness of breath , although he is limited bysome leg pain. He does not have stairs at home. He has neverhad syncope before this episode. He also noted cough with specksof blood in his sputum the day prior to admission as well as aburning pain in his chest or stomach.

Chest x-ray revealed aleft lower lobe opacity , question post obstructive pneumonia.EKG revealed irregular inferior lead T wave inversions and a newQ in lead 3 , also T wave inversion in the lateral leads , lost Rwaves in V2 and V3 compared to earlier EKG of February 2004.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Was notable for a temperatureof 99.9 , heart rate 91 , BP 132/61 , respirations 36 , satting 96%on 3 liters. The patient was in no acute distress. His JVP wasflat. His heart exam was notable for a 3/6 diamond shapedsystolic murmur at the base. Lungs had diminished breath soundsbilaterally and crackles over the left lower lobe. He did havewheezes. Abdomen was soft , nontender and nondistended. Rectalexam was guaiac negative.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Cardiovascular. Patient has history of critical aorticstenosis with valve area of 0.9 cm2. He did present with syncopeultimately of unknown cause , but possibly related to his AS. Atpresentation he also had an non-ST elevation MI with peaktroponin of 0.89. This did trend down in the days followingadmission. Four days following admission the patient also had anepisode of acute pulmonary edema which was thought to be ischemicin nature. This did resolve with Lasix and patient was seen byCardiology consult who reviewed the case and confirmed that thispatient is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve repair. Itwas also felt that the risks of valvuloplasty would outweigh thepotential benefits and that percutaneous intervention viacatheterization likewise was not indicated at this time given thepatients multiple other comorbidities. The patient will followup in Cardiology Clinic with Dr. Ralph Flato . She wouldlike to see him one to two weeks after discharge and her officewill contact patient's family to set up appointment.2. Infectious Disease. Infiltrates seen on chest x-ray atadmission felt to be pneumonia. The patient was treated with a10 day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl and was discharged on noantibiotics.3. Pulmonary. The patient was treated for COPD exacerbationduring this admission. He was discharged on 30mg of prednisonewith instructions to taper 10mg every 3 days starting the dayfollowing discharge.4. Endocrine. At the time of admission the patient was on aregimen of NPH 21 units q.a.m. and 11 units q.p.m. This wasadjusted over the course of his hospitalization and at the timeof discharge he is discharged on 32 units of NPH q.a.m.and 6units of NPH q.p.m.5. Renal. Patient had some acute renal failure at admissionlikely related to his cardiac status and some intravascularvolume depletion.

Patient has beenmanaged medically , however , recently , the patient's heart failurehas progressed to the point where conventional therapy is unable tosustain her. The patient was admitted in September 1993 with dyspnea andchest pain. At that time , the patient ruled out for myocardialinfarction and was discharged home on exogenous oxygen therapy.Patient returned shortly thereafter with shortness of breath andwas begun on intravenous Dobutamine. She was subsequentlydischarged home after her heart failure resolved. Patient ,however , returned a third time with similar complaints of shortnessof breath and dyspnea and remained in the hospital awaiting a hearttransplant. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history ofnon-Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a history oftreated tuberculosis. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Patient has ahistory of total abdominal hysterectomy and rightsalpingo-oophorectomy. Patient has no known tobacco or ethanolhistory. Catheterization on May demonstrated a pulmonarycapillary wedge pressure of 38 with a pulmonary artery pressure of80 systolic/50 diastolic. Cardiac index was 1.4 and an echodemonstrated severely dilated left ventricle with an ejectionfraction of between 25 and 30%. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lasix 120 mgp.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Vasotec 10 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , andtwo liters nasal cannula O2.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was a sickly appearing female whowas short of breath. HEENT: Unremarkable.NECK: Remarkable for jugular venous distention to the angle of thejaw. CARDIAC: III/VI holosystolic murmur appreciated with an S3gallop. ABDOMEN: Liver was 13 to 14 cm. Otherwise , the abdomenwas soft. EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting edema to the mid shin.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: BUN was 24 , creatinine 1.2 , PT was 16.1 ,PTT was 34 , white count was 8 , hematocrit49% , and digoxin was 1.4. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 110with a left bundle-branch block pattern and first degree AV block.Chest X-Ray revealed cardiomegaly and liver function tests weregrossly normal.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient underwent a heart transplant on Octoberwithout perioperative difficulty. The patientwas transferred to the Intensive Care Unit immediatelypost-operatively and remained there for her first several dayspost-operatively. The patient's early post-operative course wascomplicated by right sided heart dysfunction and elevated PApressures. Echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricularfunction. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarctionpost-operatively and was managed on Dobutamine and Inocor. As PApressures remained elevated , the patient was switched to Milrinoneand her other pressors were weaned off gradually. The patient hadchest tubes left in place for approximately twelve dayspost-operatively at which time the chest tubes were discontinued.Patient's Swan was removed on post-operative day ten and CVPmonitoring was used to estimate right heart function. Thepatient's Milrinone was gradually weaned off and the patient's CVPremained in the 12 to 16 mm range. The patient was subsequentlytransferred to the floor where she did well. The patient wasbiopsied twice prior to discharge , both times demonstrating norejection. Of note , the patient appeared to develop Cyclosporintoxicity early in her post-operative course with rapidly risingcreatinine levels and elevated liver function tests. The patientwas placed on Trental 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. and subsequently given aseven day course of OKT3 after which time the patient was restartedon her Cyclosporin with no ill effect. The patient was noted tohave a left sided pleural effusion that was tapped approximatelytwo and a half weeks into the patient's post-operative period. 400cc of pleural fluid was removed which grew no bacteria out. Thepatient's effusion was followed by chest X-Ray and was noted againto reaccumulate. Approximately one and a half weeks later , a chesttube was placed with the recovery of approximately 700 cc of fluid.This was done with ultrasound guidance. The chest tube remained inplace approximately five days and was subsequently removed. Aresidual small left pneumothorax was noted. This pneumothorax wasunchanged over the ensuing three days after chest tube removal andthe patient was discharged home with a stable small leftpneumothorax.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Patient is discharged home onDapsone 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 225 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Imuran 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Magnesium Gluconate 1 gram q.i.d. ,Procardia XL 90 mg p.o. q.d. , Trental 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,Prednisone 30 mg p.o. q.d. , Humulin NPH 18 units subcutaneouslyq.a.m. , Lasix 40 mg q.a.m. q.d. , K-Dur 40 mEq p.o. q.d. , and Serax15 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. for agitation.

He denies any chestpain , fevers , chills , or other symptoms.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Familial cardiomyopathy , history of anAICD placed in 2001 , last ejection fraction of 50% with abiventricular pacing , and severe mitral and tricuspidregurgitation.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 , Isordil 30 t.i.d. ,spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide 200 p.o. b.i.d. , K-Dur 20once a day , and folate 5 once a day.ALLERGIES: ACE inhibitors cause a cough and rash and lisinoprilcauses cough.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smoked 2 packs per day timesapproximately 10 years and drinks occasional ethanol. He deniesany history of other drug use. He is married and is with 2children. He does not work currently secondary to hiscardiomyopathy. He also has a brother who is status post cardiactransplant.EXAMINATON DATA: Temperature 96 , Pulse 97 , blood pressure 90/70 ,and oxygen saturation 97 on room air. Admission weight 83.8kilograms. JVP was greater than the angle of the jaw. Cardiacexam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic murmur at theapex. Respiratory exam showed a few bibasilar rales. Abdomenwas distended with mild shifting dullness. There was tracebilateral extremity edema.LABORATORY VALUES: Creatinine 1.5 , sodium 129 , potassium 2.7 ,magnesium 2.2 , ALT 32 , AST 31 , hematocrit 40.6 , white blood cellcount 7.3 , platelets 281 , INR 1.2 , PTT 35.4 , and BNP 594.INITIAL ASSESSMENT: This is a 36-year-old man with familialcardiomyopathy admitted for CHF exacerbation.Problem#1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted indecompensated failure. He reports compliance with hismedications; however , likely some component of thisdecompensation is secondary to dietary indiscretion with foodsand fluids. The patient was diuresed during his hospital stayinitially with intravenous torsemide; however , this wasunsuccessful and a Lasix drip with BNP drip was started onhospital day #3. He reached a total weight loss of approximately2 to 3 kilograms and was converted to oral medicines includingtorsemide. Moreover , he failed to maintain a stable weight onthis regimen and ultrafiltration was attempted. That removedapproximately 900 cc of fluids. This failed secondary tointravenous access clotting and the patient's frustration withhaving to lying still. The patient was subsequently converted tooral torsemide and metolazone , torsemide 200 b.i.d. , metolazone 5b.i.d. , and spironolactone 25 b.i.d. as an oral regimen. Per thepatient's request and reaching a somewhat adequate goal with thishospitalization , the patient requested to be discharged. Hereported that he would follow up with the CHF nursing staff andwith Dr. Adamski and although we repeatedly stressed the importanceof free water restriction and fluid restriction , he continued tobe noncompliant with this while inhouse. At the time the patientwas discharged , it was felt that he was not optimalhemodynamically , but had excellent followup plans and stated thathe would return if his condition worsened.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 once a day , Isordil 10t.i.d. metolazone 5 b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 b.i.d. , torsemide200 b.i.d. , and K-Dur 60 b.i.d.There are no pending studies at the time of discharge. Thepatient will follow up with the CHF nurse in approximately 2 daysand see Dr. Weyhrauch in clinic within 1 week.eScription document: 2-0710356 ISSten TelDictated By: GANTZ , LOYDAttending: KLEINPETER , PEDRODictation ID 5718928D: 11/6/05T: 7/20/05

He also complained of a productive cough and wasfound to have a room air oxygen saturation of 82% that improvedto the mid 90s on nonrebreather. He was admitted to the ICUwhere he was started on BiPAP and given prednisone and nebulizertreatments. Chest x-ray identified a right middle lobeinfiltrate and the patient was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacinand ceftazidime. Ceftazidime was later discontinued. He wasquickly weaned to 5 liters nasal cannula. An ABG checked onadmission showed partial CO2 of 60 which is the patient'sbaseline. He was also found to be on acute renal failure with acreatinine of 4.9 that improved with gentle fluids. Potassiumwas elevated at 6.4 and the patient did undergo a single run ofhemodialysis.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , coronary artery disease status postend-stomy , diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , hyperlipidemiaand gout.HOME MEDICATIONS: Include aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , Norvasc 10mg p.o. daily , Toprol 100 mg p.o. daily , Avapro 150 mg p.o.daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily , Lipitor 40 mg p.o. nightly , TriCor48 mg p.o. daily , NPH 55 units in the morning , 34 units in theevening , NovoLog 8 units q.a.c. , allopurinol 300 mg p.o. daily ,Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily , albuterol 2 puffs p.r.n. , Combiventp.r.n. , Advair 500/50 b.i.d. , multivitamin once per day , folate 1mg p.o. daily and loratadine 10 mg p.o. daily.ALLERGIES: There are no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: A 30-pack-year history of smoking , history ofcurrent alcohol use , five drinks per day.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On transfer to the floor temperature is96 , pulse 82 , blood pressure 150/72 , respiratory rate is 24 ,oxygen saturation 94% on 5 liters nasal cannula. He is in noapparent distress. Heart is regular rate and rhythm withoutmurmurs , rubs or gallops. He has good air movement butexpiratory wheezes and prolonged expiratory phase. There are norales. His abdomen is soft , obese , nontender and bowel soundsare present. There is 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.LABORATORY DATA: On admission to the floor , BUN 211 , creatinine3.5 , potassium 4.4. White count 13.4 , hematocrit 25.8 , platelets492 and INR 1.3. Microbiology , numerous blood , sputum and urinecultures are negative. Studies and echocardiogram from 7/21shows an EF of 55-60% with no regional wall abnormalities.IMPRESSION: This is a 60-year-old gentleman admitted for a COPDexacerbation in the setting of likely pneumonia with acute onchronic renal failure and hyperkalemia that has resolved sincehis admission.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Pulmonary: The patient was kept on prednisone 60 mg p.o.daily for the first several days of his floor admission and hewas continued on DuoNeb q.6 h. , albuterol labs were added q.6 h.staggered with DuoNeb such that he was receiving nebulizertreatments every three hours. He was continued on chest PT. Thepatient was started on CPAP overnight for history of obstructivesleep apnea. He had not been compliant with CPAP as anoutpatient. Advair was continued. The patient did well withthis regimen and his oxygen requirements were titrated from 5liters to 2.5 liters at the time of discharge. At this level ofoxygen he was satting in the low to mid 90s with ambulatory satof approximately 90%. The importance of continuing use of homeoxygen both during the day and at night was discussed at lengthwith the patient , though he continued to complain that he haddifficulty going about his daily activities wearing his oxygen. Prednisonewas slowly tapered and at the time of discharge the patient wastaking 40 mg of prednisone per day. He will take 20 mg startingthe first day after his discharge and will complete a slowapproximately 2-week taper. His home dose of Lasix wascontinued. The patient was not felt to be clinically volumeoverloaded. However , he auto-diuresed 1-2 liters the majorityof the days he was admitted to the floor. Followup was arrangedwith the patient's primary care provider and his pulmonologistDr. Gering . The possibility of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitationwas discussed at length with the patient and his wife who wereextremely resistant to any other inpatient care. He is thereforedischarged with home VNA , though the possibility of inpatient vs outpatientpulmonary rehabilitation should be considered at his followup.2. Renal: The patient's creatinine trended down throughout histime on the floor. This happened in the setting of continuedauto-diuresis , suggesting that his initial renal failure was dueto a low flow state as result of heart failure rather thanhypovolemia. At the time of discharge his creatinine was 1.3.He was followed by the Renal Team during his admission. His ARBwas initially held but then restarted upon improvement of hiscreatinine. Per renal , his elevated BUN in the range of 200 wasfelt to be secondary to steroid use. This had normalized by thetime of discharge. The patient was worked up for a possible AVfistula or graft placement in the left upper extremity in thenear future. He will follow up with vascular surgery as anoutpatient for vein mapping as an outpatient. He should not receive blooddraws in the left upper extremity of avoidable.3. Infectious disease: The patient was continued on vancomycinand Levaquin for a seven-day course. He completed this courseduring this hospitalization and he discharged off antibiotics.All cultures were no growth at the time of discharge.4. Cardiovascular: He was continued on aspirin andanti-lipidemics. His Lopressor was titrated for hypertension andhe is discharged on 300 mg of Toprol per day the rest of hisantihypertensive medicines have not changed. He was kept on teleduring his admission and did have occasional episodes of NSVTusually triplets or couplets. These were asymptomatic.5. Endocrine: Mr. Vitro insulin requirements increaseddramatically during his ICU admission , likely as a result ofsteroid use and stress. His insulin requirements fell to theirpreadmission levels during his admission on the floor.6. Prophylaxis: He was maintained on heparin and proton pumpinhibitor.CODE STATUS: The patient is full code.PHYSICAL EXAM ON DISCHARGE: He is in no apparent distress.Heart , regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs or gallops.His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes ,rales or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft , obese , nontender , bowelsounds are present. He has trace peripheral edema bilaterally.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Please see remainder of dischargepaperwork.DISPOSITION: To home with VNA. He should follow up with bothhis primary care doctor and pulmonologist. These appointmentshave been arranged for him.eScription document: 5-2153117 CSSten TelCC: Owen Augusto M.D.Son Aville HospitalVille StaCC: Rosendo Waage MDM CAAN HEALTHTon- Veca SolosCC: Lyman Kea M.D.Ards Elk Medical CenterNo SpoDictated By: TIOTUICO , RODNEYAttending: TOWSE , JEFFDictation ID 6062399D: 10/26/07T: 10/26/07

For the past two years , Ms.Va had experienced a steady very gradual decline in herexercise tolerance with a decreased ability to make her bed orvacuum. However , she noticed this only in retrospect. On6/4/97 , she presented to an outside hospital complaining of theabrupt onset over one day of weakness , shortness of breath , 1/10chest pain radiating to bilateral elbows , and dizziness. Symptomsoccurred at rest and were not positional and there were norelieving or aggravating signs. They lasted approximately ninehours resolving in the Emergency Department at the outside hospitalbefore therapy was initiated. Chest x-ray at this time showed mildcongestive heart failure which responded to Lasix 20 mg intravenouspush in the Emergency Department. She was admitted , ruled out fora myocardial infarction with CK of 31 , 67 , 64 , and 59 , and sent tocatheterization on 3/8/97 which showed a left ostia at 30% , 25 mmmitral valve gradient , pulmonary artery pressure of 8 , wedge of 18 ,and cardiac output of 5.3. Echo revealed right and left atrialenlargement , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspidregurgitation , ejection fraction was 60% to 65% , and mitralstenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm squared down from 1.2cm squared in 6/10 .

Normal pylorus and normal duodenum.KUB post-EGD: No free air or obstruction.Gastric emptying study: Mildly delayed emptying , no reflux.EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis and intervals , rightbundle-branch block , no ST or T-wave changes.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Following several studies in theemergency department as well as consultations from thegastroenterologist and the general surgeons , the patient wasthought to have abdominal pain secondary to gastroparesis giventhe findings on the EGD and CT as well as the negative ultrasoundand KUB. The gastroparesis was thought to be secondary to hisdiabetes. He was admitted to the medical service and his dietwas slowly increased. On the floor , his pain continued , andwithin two to three days , he began spiking fevers to 101 to 102.He had a repeat abdominal CT , which showed a distendedgallbladder with circumferential wall thickening and extensivestranding of the pericholecystic fat , which represented acuteacalculous cholecystitis. Surgery was reconsulted , and thepatient was taken to the operating room where he had anexploratory laparoscopy , which was then converted to an opencholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. The patientreceived perioperative vancomycin , Levaquin , and Flagyl andcontinued to do well post surgery with advancement of his dietand decrease in his pain medication requirement. Vancomycin wasdiscontinued on 4/14/2006 after six days of vancomycin. He wascontinued on the Levaquin and Flagyl. He had a drain that wasleft in following surgery , and this was pulled on 4/14/2006 .Following the pulling of the drain , he developed leakage ofgreen-tinged serous fluid from his abdominal wound. An abdominalCT was done which showed a small fluid collection and no abscess.An ERCP was done which showed a cystic duct stump bile leak.They did a biliary sphincterotomy and stenting with no furtherleak. The patient was continued on empiric Levaquin and Flagylfollowing the procedure. His diet was advanced and he toleratedthis well. He had no further pain. He is being discharged on atotal of seven days of Levaquin and Flagyl following the bileleak.Endocrine: The patient was continued on lower-dose insulin whilehe was n.p.o. and this was titrated up as his diet increased.Cardiovascular: The patient was followed by the cardiactransplant team. He was initially switched to IV cyclosporineand his CellCept was held. These were transitioned to p.o. andrestarted following his improvement. Postoperatively , he gotstress-dose hydrocortisone instead of his prednisone and this wasthen tapered to Solu-Medrol and then back to prednisone at hishome dose. He was fluid overloaded following the surgery. Hegot 100 of IV Lasix times several doses , and then restarted onhis torsemide to maintain euvolemia. His Cartia was initiallydiscontinued for a question of contribution to gastroparesis , butthis was then restarted. He was discharged on all his homemedications with the torsemide at a dose of 40 mg q.a.m.Rheumatology: Following his surgery , he developed bilateralelbow pain , which was thought to be likely secondary to gout.The rheumatology service was consulted. A left elbow tap wasattempted , but this did not return any fluid. He was givenseveral doses of colchicine p.r.n. with improvement. The steroidtaper was slowed and his gout improved. He was dischargedwithout any elbow pain.Phlebitis: He developed left arm phlebitis secondary to aninfiltrating IV. This was covered by his antibiotics that werestarted for his cholecystitis and his arm improved.FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS:1. The patient will follow up with the cardiac transplantservice. This will be arranged by them.2. The patient will need to follow up with Dr. Magdefrau fromgeneral surgery ( 800-336-8213 ) to have his staples removed in twoweeks.3. The patient will need to follow up with Dr. Vinion fromgastroenterology to schedule an appointment to have his stentsremoved in six weeks.4. The patient will continue to take his cardiac medications asbefore. His torsemide is dosed now at 40 mg q.a.m.5. The patient will continue on Levaquin and Flagyl asprescribed for five days following discharge.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg daily.2. Caltrate 600 plus D 1500 mg daily.3.

Of note , during the patient'sprevious admission , she was diagnosed with a urinary tractinfection as well as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis based on adiagnostic paracentesis , which showed greater than 250neutrophils. During that admission , the patient was treated fora urinary tract infection and the SBP and was sent home on acourse of oral cefpodoxime. Of note , during that previousadmission , the patient was also hyperglycemic and was dischargedon an insulin regimen of Lantus 90 with good aspartate slidingscale. At home , the patient's blood pressures were in the 200 to300s and at times even higher. Over the week prior to admission ,it was noted that the patient gained somewhere from about 8 to 10pounds with increasing abdominal girth and lower extremity edema.As noted above , the patient's fingersticks were noted to beelevated in the 300s and so her Lantus was titrated from 90 unitsdaily to 100 units by the visiting nurse. The patient waspreviously discharged on Lasix 40 mg twice daily , which wastitrated up to 80 mg twice daily also by the visiting nurse andher primary care physician. The patient had no additionalshortness of breath , and her oxygen sat was unchanged on her homedose of O2. She had no chest pain , no cough , and no fevers. Nonausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. The patient had finished a 7-daycourse of cefpodoxime on the day of admission. The patient'smental status was unchanged as felt by the daughter.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , on 3 L home O2.2. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.3. Cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by ascites and esophagealvarices as well as possible hepatic encephalopathy.4. Hypertension.5. Status post cholecystectomy.MEDICATIONS AT HOME:1. Fosamax 35 mg p.o. weekly.2. Caltrate 600 mg plus D 1 tabler daily.3. Cefpodoxime 200 mg daily , which was completed the day priorto admission.4. Clotrimazole troche orally four times daily.5. Dexamethasone 1 mg p.o. t.i.d.6. Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.7. Lantus 100 units subcutaneously every morning.8. Combivent 2 puffs inhaled 4 times daily.9. Lisinopril 20 mg daily.10. Nadolol 10 mg p.o. daily.11. Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily.11. Bactrim DS 1 tablet p.o. daily.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her daughter , Lescano , whois her healthcare proxy and can be reached at 976-115-0167. Thepatient has never drunk alcohol , smoked , and never used anyillicit drugs. The patient is originally from Clear A Rieholl andSpanish-speaking.FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:VITAL SIGNS: The patient was afebrile. Temperature was 96.9 ,heart rate was 62 , and blood pressure was 90/50. She wasbreathing 16 times and was saturating 99% on her home baselinedose of oxygen at 3 L.HEENT: Notable for tongue that showed thrush.NECK: JVP was difficult to asses but thought to be slightlyelevated. There was no lymphadenopathy.LUNGS: Dry inspiratory crackles at both bases.CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient has slow heart rate with normal S1and S2. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops.ABDOMEN: Slightly distended , soft , and nontender with noguarding and positive bowel sounds.EXTREMITIES: Remarkable for 3+ edema , pitted , to the knees.NEUROLOGIC: No asterixis and no focal deficits.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Electrolytes were remarkable forBUN and creatinine of 65/1.6 as well as a potassium of 6.0.Albumin was noted to be 2.6. CBC showed a white count of 8.51 ,hematocrit of 34.7 , and platelets of 92 with less than 5% bands.STUDIES: EKG reveals sinus bradycardia at 50 beats per minutewith normal axis and normal intervals and nonspecific STabnormalities , unchanged from prior EKGs. A chest x-ray showedunchanged coarse bilateral opacities with no acute process.IMPRESSION: The patient is a 76-year-old female with history ofidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosiscomplicated by ascites and esophageal varices , who was admittedwith hyperglycemia and volume overload.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with hyperglycemia andsugar in the 600s. The patient was initially started on insulindrip at 4 units per hour , and her sugars quickly normalized. Thepatient was transitioned over to subcutaneous insulin regimenthat included Lantus and q.a.c. aspartate as well as slidingscale. The patient's fingersticks remained labile throughoutthis admission and at times were elevated in the 300s and othertimes were normal in the range of 70 to 90. The patient'sinsulin was titrated , and she was discharged on a regimen thatincluded Lantus 90 units subcutaneously daily as well asaspartate 28 units subcutaneously before each meal. It wasnoticed that the patient had the most difficulty withpostprandial sugars often after lunch and dinner. Therefore , werecommended that if she continues to have hyperglycemia , that itwould be best to titrate the q.a.c. aspartate. It would be bestto avoid titrating the Lantus too much given that her fastingsugar in the morning was often normal. The patient had nohypoglycemic episodes during this admission. Of note , thepatient was not previously on q.a.c. insulin dosing at home;however , following discharge from rehabilitation , it was thoughtthat this would not likely be the best regimen for her. This wasdiscussed with the patient's family and caregivers who wereamenable to this idea , however , will likely need furtherteaching.2. GI: The patient has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosiscomplicated by ascites and esophageal varices. The patient wasthought to be grossly volume overloaded due to her cirrhosis andhypoalbuminemia on admission. The patient was initially diuresedwith IV Lasix with good results. The patient did have a bump inher creatinine due to this aggressive diuresis and her Lasix washeld for several days , but her oral Lasix was restarted prior todischarge. The patient was discharged on 60 mg of p.o. Lasixtwice daily. The patient on admission was thought to havesignificant amount of ascites based on abdominal exam. Thepatient had recently completed a course of treatment forspontaneous bacterial peritonitis and had no abdominal tendernessbut did have distention. An abdominal ultrasound was obtained asa diagnostic paracentesis was considered given that the patienthad an episode of confusion; however , abdominal ultrasoundrevealed only a small lot of ascites that was not amenable toparacentesis. The patient has a history of esophageal varicesand was continued on her nadolol for prophylaxis. The patientwas continued on her Bactrim for SBP prophylaxis. The patientdid have an episode of confusion and delirium during thisadmission , which was felt to be likely due to hepaticencephalopathy. The patient's delirium improved with theinitiation of lactulose. The patient was discharged on lactulose30 mL q.i.d. , which we titrated so that the patient has at least3 bowel movements daily. At the time of discharge , the patientwas alert and oriented. Of note , the patient was not started onAldactone for management of her volume overload given that shewas admitted with hyperkalemia and has a history of elevatedpotassium.3. Neurologic: The patient had had one episode of deliriumduring this admission where she was confused , did not know whereshe was , and was not interacting with her family appropriately.The patient had a workup at that time , which included aninfectious workup , which revealed no evidence of infection. Thepatient was started on lactulose , which had to be an administeredinitially by retention enema as she was refusing to take p.o.The patient's mental status improved within 24 hours of startingthe lactulose , and she was continued on this regimen and will bedischarged on it. Of note , the patient had no asterixis ondischarge.4. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic kidney diseasewith a baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.7. The patient wasadmitted with a creatinine of 1.6 , which did increase slightlywith increased diuresis. The patient's Lasix was held for a dayor two and then she was restarted on her oral home Lasix regimen ,which was titrated to 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. Of note , the patient'slisinopril was held on admission due to hyperkalemia. Thelisinopril was not restarted prior to discharge given thepatient's history of hyperkalemia and several episodes duringthis admission , which required the administration of Kayexalate.The patient likely should be on an ACE inhibitor for chronickidney disease , but this can be re-added as an outpatient withvery close monitoring of her potassium as this was felt to beindicated by the patient's primary care physician. Of note , thepatient was normotensive off lisinopril during this admission.5. Pulmonary: The patient has history of IPF and had no acutepulmonary issues during this admission. The patient wassaturating well on her home dose of O2 throughout the entireadmission. The patient was continued on her home dose ofdexamethasone for IPF.6. Infectious Disease: Prior to discharge , the patient wasincidentally noted to have a urine culture that was growinggreater than 100 , 000 colonies. The patient was afebrile and hadno symptoms of dysuria but did have a mildly elevated white countof 11 , 000. Based on the patient's recent UTI , she was started oncefpodoxime for a short 5-day course. Results of this urineculture will need to be followed up and her antibiotics adjustedas necessary. The patient was continued on her Bactrim for bothSPEP and PCP prophylaxis.CODE STATUS: The patient was full code throughout this entire admission.PHYSICAL EXAM AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: The patient home wasafebrile and normotensive with the heart rate in the 60s to 70sand was saturating in the high 90s on her baseline 3 L of O2 vianasal cannula. Her weight at the time of discharge was 198pounds. Her cardiac exam was normal. Her lungs had finecrackles at both bases. Her abdomen was obese with no fluidwave. Her extremities had bilateral pitting edema to the kneesand she had no asterixis.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.

AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY.2. VALVULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY.3. MITRAL REGURGITATION.4. TRICUSPID REGURGITATION.5. HYPERTENSION.6. HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA.7. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50-year-old man withvalvular cardiomyopathy , status postthree aortic valve replacements , who presents with no acutecomplaints but a progressive decline in daily function.Mr. Kozub history begins in 9/13 when he presented withshortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in thesetting of medications ( Lasix and/or Procardia for hypertension )noncompliance. He was found by echo to have severe aorticinsufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricularhypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 45%. He subsequentlyunderwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valverepair. Aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration.One month post-surgery , he required repeat aortic valve replacementwith dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess withcultures positive for yeast , for which he was treated withamphotericin-B , vancomycin and gentamicin. At this time , he alsorequired coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair. Thishospital course was additionally complicated by development ofthird degree heart block necessitating the implantation of apermanent pacemaker. After discharge , Mr. Buzo did generallywell for the following years until 9/4 , when he again presentedwith increasing shortness of breath. Echo then revealed moderateto severe aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation.Cardiac catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. At thistime , his aortic valve was again replaced with a St. Jude's valve.Again , following discharge , Mr. Kock did generally well until4/19 when again he presented with shortness of breath. At thattime , echo showed at least mild perivalvular aortic regurgitationwith left ventricular dilatation ( The systolic diameter of 6.1 cm ) ,along with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , andan ejection fraction of 15-20%. Stress testing at this time showeda physical work capacity of 15.1. It is not documented what wasdone at this time , but apparently his Lasix was increased from40 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d. with good effect. Regarding thisadmission , Mr. Bessemer reports that he has been feeling fine and ishere in the hospital because his doctors want to replace his valve ,or if that doesn't work as it hasn't the last three times , to givehim a new heart all together. He reports no increasing dyspnea ,fatigue , ankle edema or abdominal girth. He sleeps on threepillows at night and has not recently been short of breath whenlying flat. He is able to do chores around the house withoutgetting short of breath , but usually does get short of breath afterone flight of stairs. He doesn't complain of significantdisability or quality of life impairment as a result of his heartcondition. He notes that he has not been able to participate inthe marching band over the last year , but that he can play sittingdown. Mr. Lonn attributes his disease to having beennoncompliant with his Procardia following the cerebrovascularaccident in 1993. He says that , "He brought on his heart problemshimself."PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Otherwise , notable for an embolism to hisleft foot in 1998 as a result of havingstopped Coumadin therapy , chronic renal insufficiency withcreatinine ranging from 1.4-2.2 in 2/12 , and he is status postexploratory laparotomy in 1960 from a gunshot wound.ALLERGIES: He is allergic to Zestril , which gives him perioralangioedema.MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg b.i.d , atenolol 50 mg q.d. , Avapro150 mg q.d. , Coumadin 5 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mgb.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg q.d.FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for heart disease.SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 35 pack-year smoking history , but quitone year ago. He has occasional alcohol use.Mr. Allegrini is on permanent disability leave from his job atDes Jack Oxall , which involved a lot of heavy lifting. He lives at homewith his wife and 19-year-old son , and spends most of his daythere. He is active in Naomin Me Yonkers , where he likes to play the basedrum.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: He is a thin , healthy-appearingblack man in no apparent distress. VITALSIGNS: Heart rate 65 , blood pressure 120/70 , oxygen saturation 98%on room air. NECK: His carotid pulses variance and normal involume. Jugular venous pressure 7 cm. LUNGS: Clear. His PMI isvibratory in quality and prominent , lateral to the anterioraxillary line. He has a normal S1 , an ejection sound , and a loudprosthetic S2 , a III/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternalborder , and a III/IV holodiastolic murmur at the left lower sternalborder radiating to the right upper sternal border. ABDOMEN:Non-distended , with no organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Warm with faintpulses.LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 2.3 , hematocrit33.5 , with a MCV of 83.5 , RDW of 28.8 ,reticulocyte count of 6.6 and LDH of 1077. Mr. Shadler had an echohere that showed severe aortic insufficiency with a severelydilated left ventricle ( and diastolic diameter of 7.0 and systolicdiameter of 6.3 ) , as well as mild to moderate mitral and tricuspidregurgitation and an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Exercise testingshowed an oxygen uptake of 12.7. On cath , his pulmonary arterypressure , wedge pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was47/16 , 13 and 379 , which fell to 26/4 , 5 , and 137 , respectivelywith Nipride. His systemic vascular resistance was markedlyelevated at 2400 and a thick cardiac output and cardiac index were3.62 and 2.31. Amlodipine was then started and Lasix was increasedin an effort to reduce his systemic vascular resistance andpulmonary wedge pressure. The remainder of the transplant workupresults were unremarkable except for a significantly reduceddiffusing capacity of 59% corrected , a creatinine clearance of 48.4and a prostate specific antigen of 18.1. Prostate biopsy and bonescan were both negative. His admission was otherwise notable foran elevated creatinine to 3.0 in the setting of perioperativelevofloxacin and gentamicin , as well as aggressive vasodilatortherapy. He was allowed to drift back down to his baseline of low2's before discharge.Mr. Krough was discharged home in stable condition on the followingmedications:DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. ,Coumadin 5 mg q.d. , amlodipine 2.5 mg q.d. ,Avapro 150 mg q.d. , Niferex 150 mg q.d. , ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: He will follow-up with Dr. Lon Poat intwo weeks.Dictated By: MERVIN PAVELKA , M.D.Attending: HARRIS B.

Her risk factors include positive familyhistory , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia. Her cardiachistory included a myocardial infarction in 1983 , followed bypost-infarct sustained in 1989 , which was treated medically. Shehad a preop evaluation prior to bladder surgery , at which time , anETT was positive and cardiac cath revealed 70% proximal LAD , 70%mid LAD , 70% distal LAD , 50% proximal circumflex , total occlusionof obtuse marginal I , an 80% occlusion obtuse marginal IIocclusion. She was managed medically without any further symptomsuntil 11/27 when she developed chest pain on exertion , which wasagain treated medically. On 2/9/97 , she was admitted to Ton Valley Hospital And Medical Center for elective bladder suspension which was attemptedlaparoscopically but complicated by bladder rupture and wasconverted to an open procedure. Intraoperatively , she was noted tohave ST changes. She was taken to the ICU where she ruled out fora myocardial infarction. However , subsequently , she developedchest pain and shortness of breath , with ST depression. She wastherefore transferred to the Nin Vensca Memorial for cardiaccatheterization and possible coronary revascularization.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , coronaryartery disease.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Bladder suspension in 1995 and 1997.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS: Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q.d.; atenolol 30 mg p.o.q.d.; Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Premarin 0.625 mg p.o.q.d.; Bactrim DS 1 tab p.o. b.i.d.; Dilatrate 40 mg t.i.d.;Compazine 10 mg p.r.n. q.8h.; Darvocet 100 mg p.r.n. q.4h.; heparinsubcu.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient does not smoke.FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS - Afebrile , pulse 77 , regular , BP120/60 , two liters saturating 97%.

PT was 14.1 , INR 1.4 , PTT 29.1.Urinalysis showed 20 to 25 hyaline casts with 3-5 red blood cells.There were no white blood cells.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Servicewith a presumptive diagnosis of a left sidedstroke. A head CT was performed on hospital day number one but wasnegative with no evidence of cerebral infarct or bleeding.However , a follow up head CT on hospital day number threedemonstrated acute infarct in the left insular capsule and leftcorona radiata. A carotid ultrasound was obtained on hospital daynumber five which demonstrated bilateral carotid plaques with lessthan 50 percent stenosis of both carotid arteries. Because of thepatient's history of diabetes and his cardiac history , especiallygiven his prior myocardial infarction , the patient was placed on aROMI protocol. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarctionand he was given a cardiac echocardiogram on hospital day numbertwo. The echocardiogram demonstrated increased left ventricularsize with preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of65 percent. He had dilated left and right atria and he hadthickened mitral valve leaflets with 4+ mitral regurgitation , withflow reversible into his pulmonary veins. He also had 3 to 4+tricuspid regurgitation with slow reversal into the vena cava. Hehad a trileaflet aortic valve with mild sclerosis but noinsufficiency or stenosis. He also had increased right heart sizewith right heart pressures of 55 to 60 mm of mercury. He was notedto have a trivial pericardial effusion. Of note , there was noevidence of any thrombus in the heart. However , because of thenature of his stroke , which was felt to be embolic by neurology , aswell as his enlarged atria. The patient was placed on IV Heparinand he was then started on oral Coumadin for long-termanticoagulation. The patient did very well after his stroke andhis original slurred speech improved markedly over the course ofhis admission. He also regained full strength in his right arm ,although he continued to have some decreased coordination in thatarm. The patient also demonstrated inability to swallow withoutdifficulty and an esophagogram with video analysis was performed onhospital day number six , prior to his discharge. The video studyof his swallowing demonstrated that he had essentially normalswallowing and he was cleared to go home on a regular diet. Ofnote , his blood pressure tended to be low , around 100 to 110systolic , while in the hospital , so his Lisinopril was discontinuedand he was given instructions that Lisinopril would be restarted byhis CMC attending after his discharge. His hydroxyurea wasincreased from 500 mg to 1 gram q day. The patient did quite wellafter his stroke and he was discharged home with services onApril , 1995.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: His discharge medications wereColchicine 0.6 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 40mg p.o. q day , insulin NPH 30 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and 20units subcutaneous q.p.m. , Atrovent inhaler two puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.wheezing , multivitamins one capsule p.o. q day , Coumadin 4 mg p.o.q.h.s. , and Indocin 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. gout pain.DISPOSITION: DIET: The patient is on an ADA 1800 calorie diet.ACTIVITY: He has no activity restrictions.Dictated By: DEMARCUS NACK , M.D. OM20Attending: ALFREDO L.

Thepatient had a history of rheumatic fever as a child , and shepresented in 1985 with mitral and aortic valvular endocarditisfollowing a root canal. She subsequently underwent aortic andmitral valve replacement secondary to her aortic and mitralinsufficiency. Her perioperative course was complicated by a brainabscess which was without neurologic residual deficit. In 1989 thepatient again presented with recurrent endocarditis and underwent arepeat mitral valve and aortic valve replacement. For the past yearprior to presentation , she has had increasing symptoms of rightheart failure including lower extremity edema and ascites which didnot improve with medical treatment. She has also presented withcomplaints of shortness of breath. In February of 1993 she underwenta transesophageal echo which revealed a perivalvular leak for whichshe underwent her third mitral valve replacement. Tricuspidannuloplasty was performed at that time. The patient has neversignificantly improved past her most recent surgery and her mostrecent transesophageal echo performed in Ta Ca Elponcevo threeweeks prior to presentation demonstrated again a perivalvularmitral leak. The patient has had a significant lower extremityedema with a weight gain of 30 pounds since her discharge one monthago. She has no shortness of breath at rest but does havesignificant dyspnea on exertion with minimal effort. She deniesfever or chills.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is as stated above. Shealso has some chronic renal insufficiencywith baseline BUN and creatinine of 40 and 2.0. She is status postcholecystectomy in 1990.MEDICATIONS: Her medications on presentation to the Paa Talc Rton Health wereLasix 100 mg b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.25 mg every other day ,Coumadin 5 mg alternating with 2.5 mg every day , and Captopril 12.5mg three times a day. She is allergic to penicillin and codeine.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her admission physical exam was notable fora tired appearing female with a cardiac examnotable for mechanical valvular heart sounds and 4+ pitting lowerextremity edema.LABORATORY DATA: Her admission BUN and creatinine were 61 and 1.9.HOSPITAL COURSE: She was admitted to the Cardiology Service andwas evaluated by the Cardiac Surgical Service , andit was felt that mitral valve repair and/or replacement would bebeneficial to the patient. She , therefore , underwent mitral valverepair on 2 of November but was without significant symptoms for herright heart failure , and was placed on the cardiac transplant list.She underwent successful cardiac transplantation on 18 of September .  Sincethat time , her main issues have centered over management of herresidual ascites with diuresis of her third spaced volume.Additionally she had had some nose bleeds preoperatively which werefelt to be related to nasal polyps for which she was seen by theENT Service. She underwent routine post transplant biopsies andechocardiograms , all of which showed adequate acceptance of organsand good LV function. She continued to do quite well with theexception of some dysphagia early in her postoperative course whichwas found to be possibly secondary to some esophageal ulcerations ,but these have subsequently resolved and she is tolerating aregular diet. She was noted two days prior to transfer to theNorri Verlan Medical Center to have some diffuse mildabdominal pain , and KUB and upright revealed large amounts ofstool , and she felt great relief from soap suds enemas. She hasbeen stable on her medications with adequate cyclosporine levels.Imuran was recently held secondary to neutropenia.DISPOSITION: The patient was transferred to the Holls Health on approximately the thirdpostoperative week from her cardiac transplant.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications include Mylicon 80mg p.o. t.i.d. , Trental 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,Nystatin cream topically once per day , Mycostatin powder topicallyonce per day , terbutaline 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Nystatin swish andswallow 10 cc p.o. t.i.d. , magnesium oxide 280 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,human regular insulin 4 units subcu q a.m. and before dinner andNPH insulin 28 units subcu q a.m. , omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q a.m. ,cyclosporine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. plus levels checked daily ,potassium 40 mEq q a.m. , prednisone 27.5 mg p.o. q a.m. , Lasix 40mg p.o. q a.m. , Percocet as needed for pain and Serax 10 mg asneeded at night for sleep.FOLLOW UP: She will follow up with the Cardiac TransplantationService. She is referred to Rush-coo Chry's Calctist Medical Center for physical therapy rehabilitation as well as medicationsmanagement and assistance. She is discharged to U Hospital on 8 of April .Dictated By: WERNER YOON , M.D. MY51Attending: ISMAEL L. PRUIETT , M.D. HL16  QX021/0186Batch: 365 Index No. Q3PJBU7JEZ D: 5/12/93T: 5/12/93

The patient was seen in Randuke Hospital on the day of admission and was noted to have ahematocrit drop from the 37 range to 28.5 along with hypotensionand an increasing creatinine rising from 1.2-2.3 in one week'stime.The patient was noted to have recently significantly increasinglower extremity edema. He reports that over a 3-4 day period , hewent from having almost no edema to having very large legs , whichhe describes "tree trunks." The patient reports that these werepainful at first , but are no longer painful. He reports thatthey were always symmetric. The patient reports no prior historyof CHF ( congestive heart failure ) , or any severe cardiacproblems , which he is aware , but does report having heart attackat 27 years old. The patient did not know the details of thesecardiac events at 27 years old , and has received minimal followupfor this issue. He does report that he was intermittently seenby a cardiologist , and had a normal catheterization four yearsago. He reports he has never had an echocardiogram.The patient also reports an episode of 30-minute chest tightnessthe day prior to admission while he was having a Foley catheterplaced. The patient did not tell anyone about this at that time ,and this pain desisted on its own. The pain was described assubsternal burning pain , with no left arm pain , no jaw pain , noshortness of breath or diaphoresis , and no nausea or vomiting.The patient has had no orthopnea or PND.The patient has had a recent history increasingly worsening BPH.The patient has a 15-year history of BPH , and is followed by Dr.Tod Cutshall at Kernmilf Nadrock Hospital And Health Center .  The patient wasrecently admitted to SHHC for anuria , had a cystoscopy , clotevacuation and was discharged on 7/24/05 with a Foley in place.The patient followed up with Dr. Queen on 10/21/05 , had hisFoley removed , but failed this trial and he represented to anoutside hospital with clots and anuria. The patient's bladderwas irrigated and the Foley was replaced. He reports that he hasbeen passing clots but that he has been passing urine. Thepatient also reports that his urine while having clots at times ,is mostly clear and yellow , and that he continually makes urineand has to replace the Foley bag.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.

Cancer - The patient does have history of cancer in hisfamily , but is unclear of the details.BRIEF PHYSICAL EXAM:Vital signs: Temperature 96.5 , pulse 70 , blood pressure 100/62 ,respiratory rate 20 and the patient is satting 95% on room air.General: The patient is alert , oriented , in no acute distress ,and is not ill appearing. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic ,oropharynx is clear. No lesions or ulcers. No lymphadenopathy.Anicteric sclerae. Cardiovascular , has JVP elevated to the angleof the jaw. Regular rate and rhythm , with frequent prematurebeat. No S3 or S4 appreciated. Pulmonary: A few crackles atthe left base otherwise clear to auscultation. Abdomen: Soft ,nontender , bowel sounds present and normoactive. Nohepatosplenomegaly , no frank dullness. Extremities: 2-3+pitting edema to the knees , symmetric bilaterally , shinslukewarm. Strength 5/5 throughout in upper and lowerextremities. Neurological: The patient is alert and orientedx3 , has normal affect. Reflexes in the biceps , patellar , andAchilles tendons are equal bilaterally. Sensation grossly intacton upper and lower extremities.PERTINENT LABORATORY RESULTS:On admission , the patient's white blood cell count was 7.2 , hishematocrit was 28.5 , down from 37 one week previously. Thepatient's platelet count was 238 , 000. The patient's chem-7 wasunremarkable with the exception of a creatinine of 2.3 , up from abaseline of 1.2-1.4 over one week's time. The patient had a BNPchecked , which turned out to be 312 , elevated. The patient hasalso had several recent imaging studies including renalultrasound on 2/6/05 , which showed multiple bilateral renalcysts but no obstruction. An abdominal MRI was obtained on2/20/05 , which showed small amount of ascites , an enlargedprostate , multiple renal cysts , no other pathologies was noted.The patient also had a CT to evaluate his ureters on 10/8/05 ,which showed no stones in the kidneys or ureters , but an enlargedprostate.A cystoscopy report from 9/23/05 from a recent admission toMa Faulkmark Hospital showed oozing from tortuous veins inthe prostate.The patient had an EKG , which showed first-degree block with aleft bundle branch block , and frequent PVCs. This was noted tobe present on an old examination , after consultation with anoutpatient cardiologist at Perlaw Memorial Hospital .  The patienthad a troponin I of 0.11 , slightly elevated. The patient's CKwas 136 , MB fraction 4.3 , both within normal limits. Onadmission , the patient coagulation parameters showed an INR of1.2. Other pertinent data includes an orally reported cardiaccatheterization at Beckry Hospital in 2001 , which showed noobstructive coronary disease , but diffuse coronary arterydisease , with an ejection fraction of 50%. An adenosine MIBIobtained in 2002 at Peacepe Planthugh Memorial Medical Center showed possible oldinferior infarct , global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of35-40%. An echocardiogram obtained during this admissiondemonstrated the patient's EF at this point to be 25% , ratherwith global hypokinesis.OPERATIONS OR PROCEDURES:There were no operations or procedures performed during thisadmission.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:Cardiovascular - the patient was determined initially to belikely in congestive heart failure , with elevated neck veins , andincreased leg edema and a low blood pressure. Because thepatient was determined to be in CHF , he was diuresed with IVLasix , and later with p.o. Lasix , the patient was diuresedapproximately 2 liters per day over a 4-5 period. The patient'sblood pressure subsequently rose. After consultation withCardiology , it was determined that a beta blocker and an ACEinhibitor should be added to the patient's medication regimen ashis blood pressure would allow , for demonstrated benefit andcongestive heart failure.Because the patient was initially determined to have some risk ofmyocardial infarction , had reported chest pain the day prior toadmission , and had slightly elevated troponins. The patient'stroponin and CK-MB were followed until they began decreasing. Itis likely that these very small elevations were due to smallamount of ischemia from demand , due to the patient's fluidoverload and anemia. The patient was continued on his statinmedication.The patient on admission had frequent PVCs , and some short runsof ventricular tachycardia lasting less than 5 beats. Afterdiuresis , the patient had no further runs of VT , and had onlyminimal ectopy. The patient's electrolytes including potassiumand magnesium were checked daily and repleted as necessary.Aspirin was withheld from the patient for now , despite having abenefit in cardiac disease of this kind. This is because thepatient's hematocrit was low and he had recently had bleedinglikely from his bladder. Urology Department was consultedregarding this decision.Renal/genitourinary: The patient has a long known history of BPHand is followed closely at Cotson Tionlo Hospital by Dr.Josue Grefe . The patient was recently admitted for theseproblems due to obstruction , and instrumentation. On admission ,the patient's urine did not have any red blood cells , and he hadno obvious clots at any point. After consultation with Urology ,and after the patient had been diuresing well with Lasix , thepatient's Foley catheter was removed and after this point he hadno problem with urinating. The patient was maintained on Proscarin addition to Flomax.Heme: The patient's hematocrit drop was likely due to twofactors. First of all , the patient is known to have been losingblood in the form of clots from his bladder. This is likely dueto bleeding from the surface of his prostate where a recentcystoscopy had demonstrated tortuous veins. In addition , thereading of hematocrit of 24.5 on admission was likely secondaryto dilution , the patient was massively fluid overloaded. Thepatient's hematocrit rose after diuresis , and was maintained inthe 31-32 range without transfusion during admission. He was ,however , typed and screened , and the plan was to transfuse himshould his hematocrit decrease below 30 , given his cardiachistory.Oncologic: The patient is followed closely by Dr. Zecchini atHool Norhunt General Hospital .  His most recent treatment was on8/4/05 and his multiple myeloma seems to be responding well totherapy. During this admission , multiple myeloma was not anactive issue. See Reb Memorial Hospital notes for more information.Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes , hetakes Lantus and Novolog at home. He was continued on thesemedications while as an inpatient.Pain: The patient was offered oxycodone p.r.n. for pain. He didnot complain of any pain during admission.Psychiatric: The patient , though pleasant and cooperative onadmission , became increasingly combative. On the night of1/5/05 , he became very combative , and attempted to hit one ofthe cross covering physicians. The patient was initially triedon several medications to control this agitation including Ativanand Zyprexa. These apparently were not effective at first. Thepatient continued to have difficulty sleeping and was veryagitated. At one point , he would not take his medications.Psychiatry was involved , and after much discussion with thepatient and involvement of social work , the patient did calm downand agreed to medical care. At one point when he becameagitated , he was given Haldol intravenously , in addition toAtivan , after being given these medications , the patient sleptvery well through the night. When he awoke the next morning , hismood was much improved , and he apologized for his behavior ,reporting he did not know what happened. Because of the changein mental status , several studies were obtained to investigatethis , a head CT showed no acute disease , only some bony changeslikely chronic due to multiple myeloma. In addition , thepatient's electrolytes were checked which were normal , thepatient's fingerstick blood glucose was checked which was normal.In addition , an RPR was sent , in addition to folate and B12.These labs were pending at the time of discharge and will befollowed up by his outpatient physicians.CODE STATUS:Full code.COMPLICATIONS:There were no complications during this admission.CONSULTANTS:1.

Thrombolysis was deferred secondary to severehypertension ( systolic blood pressure was greater than 200 ).Catheterization revealed 80% RCA stenosis with thrombus. Sheunderwent PTCA and stenting and ReoPro under the Lakeni Ralton Rooson Hospital study.An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 45% , inferiorposterior lateral hypokinesis , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+mitral regurgitation , moderate aortic insufficiency. She wastreated with Ticlid for 30 days , aspirin , Lopressor , Verapamil andCaptopril. That hospital course was complicated by asymptomaticparoxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting of pneumonia and newdiagnosis of hyperthyroidism ( TSH less than assay , T4 16.1 , T3 133 ,THBR 1.24 ). She was started on Procainamide and subsequently as anoutpatient on PTU without recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Shehas been treated with Coumadin. On April , 1998 , she was admittedfor left upper extremity weakness with a question of transientischemic attack in the setting of subtherapeutic INR. Head CT scanwas negative and brain MRI/MRA was also negative. On September ,1998 , she was admitted to Hillh Hospital for flash pulmonaryedema requiring intubation. She was in normal sinus rhythm , buthypertensive. She ruled out for myocardial infarction and repeatcatheterization showed patent stent , otherwise unchanged. She wassubsequently started on Lasix and was well until the night prior toadmission when she developed gradually worsening shortness ofbreath , wheezing and chest pain. Also , she had an increase inorthopnea from one to two pillows , diaphoresis and worsening of herbaseline right shoulder pain with no edema. She had a coughproductive of scant white sputum for three days prior to admission ,no fever or chills. In the emergency room , her blood pressure wasfound to be 230/100 with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room airincreasing to 95% on two liters. She had crackles one-third of theway up her lung fields bilaterally. EKG was in normal sinusrhythm. Chest x-ray showed edema and effusion. She improvedquickly with oxygen , nitrates and Lasix.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,status post myocardial infarction inOctober of 1998 , congestive heart failure with an ejectionfraction of 45% , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , paroxysmal atrialfibrillation , hyperthyroidism , bilateral retinal detachment , statuspost left cataract surgery , status post appendectomy , status postcholecystectomy.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q. day. 5 )Procainamide 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. 6 ) Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. day.7 ) PTU 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8 ) Lasix 10 mg p.o. q. day. 9 )Prilosec.ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: She immigrated from the Pa Drive , Meroesun Geworth in1981. She lives with her daughter and has a twopack per day smoking history times 40 years. She has no alcoholuse.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , she was breathingcomfortably , supine at 30 degrees. Vitalsigns: Temperature 98.4 degrees , heart rate 61 and regular , bloodpressure 153/75 , respiratory rate 18 , with an oxygen saturation 93%on three liters. HEENT examination revealed that the sclerae wereanicteric. Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light.Extraocular movements were intact. Oropharynx was benign. Neckrevealed that the jugular venous pressure was elevated to her ear.Carotids were 1+ on the right , 2+ on the left. There was aquestion of a right carotid bruit. There was no thyromegaly.Lungs revealed crackles half way up bilaterally , no wheezing.Cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm with an S4 ,intermittent S3 , no murmurs. Abdomen revealed normal active bowelsounds , soft and non-tender , mildly distended with a pulsatileliver. Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Therewere 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. There was no calftenderness. Skin was warm and dry. Neurological examinationrevealed that cranial nerves III-XII were intact. Motor was fiveout of five throughout. Sensory was intact to light touchthroughout. Reflexes were 2+ bilaterally with downgoing toes.Rectal examination was guaiac negative in the emergency room.LABORATORY: Admission laboratory studies revealed a sodium of 140 ,potassium 4.4 , chloride 105 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 19 ,creatinine 0.6 , glucose 149. White blood cell count was 12.3 ,hematocrit 38.8 , platelet count was normal. CK was 44. Troponinwas 0.03. INR was 1.8. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 withold inferior Qs , left ventricular hypertrophy with strain in I andL which were old , T-wave inversion in III and V6 as well aspseudonormalized T-waves in V1 through V4 which are new comparedwith October , 1998. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , pulmonaryvascular redistribution , Kerley B lines , but no infiltrate.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Congestive heart failure: The assessment wasthat the patient presented in acute congestiveheart failure , most likely due to diastolic dysfunction in thesetting of hypertension. Other contributing factors possiblyplaying a role in the patient's heart failure could have includedmedication non-compliance and dietary indiscretion. Anotherpossibility entertained was that the patient could have hadtransient atrial fibrillation triggering heart failure , however allof her EKGs showed her to be normal sinus rhythm , questioning thispossibility. The patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix andstabilized on p.o. Lasix during her hospital course.She ruled out for myocardial infarction by CKs , Troponin and EKG.2 ) Hyperthyroidism: The patient's TSA was measured to be at lessthan assay on May , 1998 raising the possibility that uncontrolledhyperthyroidism could also be contributing to her cardiacdysfunction. An Endocrine consult was obtained with therecommendation that her PTU be increased to 100 mg t.i.d. Her T4and THBR were measured and found to be 8.1 and 0.91 which werewithin normal limits after the increased dose of PTU. The patientis to receive follow-up in the Thyroid Clinic for definitivetherapy , possibly iodine ablation of known thyroid nodules in herleft lobe.3 ) Elevated white blood cell count on admission , but with a normaldifferential: The patient remained afebrile throughout herhospital course. Urinalysis was negative for infection and repeatchest x-ray showed no infiltrate.4 ) Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remained in therange of 110-155/50-70s during her hospital course on Atenolol ,Isordil and Lisinopril.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Lasix80 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5 ) Lisinopril40 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) Procainamide SR 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. 7 ) PTU100 mg p.o. t.i.d. 8 ) Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q. day.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stablecondition.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with VNA servicesto check weights and assistance with medication.FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Pastor on February ,1998 and Dr. Rais in the Thyroid Clinic on August ,1998.Dictated By: SHAUN R.

Thepatient is status post CABG 1999 three vessels. The patient hasan 80-pack-year smoking history. The patient is on two liters ofnasal cannula at home. The patient is full code.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a long history ofCOPD who is on 2 liters of nasal cannula at home with80-pack-year of smoking history.Briefly , the patient is an 80-year-old gentleman who was admittedto Astine Emount Wallca Medical Center on 2/4/2004 with drowsiness andslurred speech. Initial ABG showed pH of 7.25 , PCO2 of 82 , PO2of 56 , sating 87%. He quickly awakened after Narcan wasadministered. Recently , he had been taking an increased amountof opiates for pain and he was admitted with a diagnosis ofhypercarbia secondary to increased opiate intake and COPD flare.The patient had a long history of COPD. He has an 80-pack-yearof smoking history and is normally on 2 liters of nasal cannulaat home. He was initially treated for COPD on the floor andgiven gentle hydration as he also suffers chronic renalinsufficiency. He was given Percocet for pain control. Thepatient appears to be improving by serial arterial blood gasses.Had decrease in creatinine and improved mental status. At 11:00a.m. on the 6/29/2004 the patient was found breathless andpulseless. At that time , his ABG showed a pH of 7.04 , PCO2 of95 , PO2 of 47 , he was sating 54%. An ACLS code was 1. Thepatient received 1 mg atropine and 0.04 of Narcan. He appearedto be aspirating when intubated. He was admitted to the MedicalIntensive Care Unit where he was until 2/17/2004 , when he wasdischarged.ALLERGIES: The patient has questionable penicillin allergieswith unknown reaction.PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAM:In general , the patient is an obese Hispanic male who is sedatedand intubated. He responds to commands and is oriented to voiceon admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. His skin showedhis lower extremities with changes of chronic venostasis. He haderythema to the knees , nonpitting edema bilateral to the kneesand induration of skin on legs , medial thigh , and bilateralpopliteal fossae. His feet had onychomycosis bilaterally with noclearcut abrasions or cuts. The rest of his skin exam wasremarkable for multiple ecchymoses , one weeping plaque on theabdomen at heparin injection site. His right subclavian line wasnontender and nonerythematous with one leaking port. Head andneck exam: His pupils were equal , round and reactive to light andaccommodations. His extraocular movements were intact. Hisoropharynx was clear. His endotracheal tube and OG tube were inplace. His chest sounds were clear anteriorly. He had decreasedbreath sounds laterally. He had isolated wheezing at the leftmidclavicular line. His heart sounds , S1 and S2 were heard. Hisabdomen was obese. He had a large panus , no appreciableorganomegaly , tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds.Extremities: He was moving all four extremities spontaneously.They were warm and perfused. Neurologically , his cranial nerveswere grossly intact. There were no focal anomalies.On addition , the patient had a sodium of 140 , a potassium of 5.4 ,chloride of 104 , carbon dioxide of 24 , BUN of 72 , creatinine of2.1 , glucose of 153. She had an ionized calcium of 1.04 andmagnesium of 2.1.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Pulmonary. The patient was admitted to the MICU withhypercarbic respiratory arrest and aspiration pneumonia persymptoms , signs and chest x-ray. Given the history and timing ofthe arrest , the patient likely was hypercarbic secondary to COPDexacerbation , as hypercarbic arrest occurred several days inhouse where opiates were not administered. It is highlyimprobable that the arrest happened secondary to opiate ingestionrather patient likely had COPD exacerbation. Also , the patienthas significant cardiac history of CHF and CAD , which may havecontributed. Subsequent chest CT on the floor demonstrated thatin addition the patient had very significant pleural effusions.The patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia withlevofloxacin and Flagyl and aztreonam. He was also treated withalbuterol Atrovent nebulizers. Aggressive physical therapy wasalso provided for the patient. The patient after completing hisantibiotic treatments for aspiration pneumonia was noted to haveMRSA growing in his sputum. He was given a 14-day course ofvancomycin as well to treat MRSA pneumonia. To help thepatient's pulmonary status , significant diuresis was attempted.The patient was typically diuresed at 1-2 liters per day. Theaggressive diuresis was estimated to have taken in theneighborhood of 15-20 liters of the patient and this likelyremarkably helped the patient's breathing status and his abilityto get off the ventilator. The patient had a tracheostomy andpeg placed on 8/27/04 and began breathing on trache collar onthe 6/11/04 and has been breathing until the present timesuccessfully on trache collar.2. ID. The patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. Hewas also colonized with MRSA and VSE by the end of his course.During his initial MICU admission he was diagnosed withvancomycin sensitive enterococcal UTI. He was treated withantibiotics for all of these. His aspiration pneumonia wastreated with levofloxacin , aztreonam and Flagyl. Subsequent MRSApneumonia was treated with vancomycin. The patient has not had ,at the time of admission , white count or a significant fever andhis cultures two days prior to discharge have been negative.3. Cardiovascular. The patient has a significant cardiachistory for CHF and CAD. His heart rhythm has been mostly stableduring the course of his hospitalization. Hypertension has beentreated with Lopressor.4. Renal. The patient has a history of chronic renalinsufficiency. However , renal function had improved during thepatient's hospital course. At the time of discharge , the patienthad a creatinine of 0.9 , a BUN of 38 , a potassium of 3.9 and acreatinine of 0.9. Presumably , the aggressive diuresis that wasconducted did not affect the patient's renal function adversely.5. Endocrine. The patient has a history ofnon-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. He was put on Lantusand insulin sliding scale , by the end of his day he was on 80units of Lantus plus requiring additional insulin on the slidingscale.CODE STATUS:The patient is full code. The proxy for the patient is hisdaughter , Picot , who was actively involved in the patient's care.NUTRITION:The patient was fed on Jevity tube feeds during most of hismedical ICU course.DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:The patient's physical exam was notable for a tracheostomy inplace with a clean site of insertion. GJ tube placed in theabdomen with a clean surgical wound.

The patient was inatrial fibrillation on the EKG.Admission chest x-ray from 10/30/07 , decreased size smallbilateral effusions , associated with some segmental bibasilaratelectasis versus consolidation. No frank evidence of CHF.CONSULTANTS:Hematology of BH , Dr. Bradley Ebanks .ASSESSMENT:This is an 88-year-old Co Louis Awestinsde male with a history ofhypertension , diabetes , CHF who presented with increasingshortness of breath likely secondary to CHF and also presentedwith a fever concerning for pneumonia for which he was treatedwith antibiotics. The patient also had a new diagnosis ofamyloid during this admission.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Cardiovascular:A. Ischemia: The patient has no known diagnosis of CAD;however , he has many risk factors. The patient had a troponin of0.7 on admit which subsequently trended down. This troponin leakwas thought to be due to demand. The patient remained chestpain-free during his entire hospital course , and had no acuteischemic issues. The patient was continued on his aspirin ,beta-blocker and statin medications.B. Pump: The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 40-45%.In the past , this congestive heart failure had been presumablyattributed to ischemic for hypertensive etiology. However ,during this admission , the patient had a cardiac biopsy that waspositive for amyloid suggesting that amyloid is the causeunderlying his CHF. The patient appeared mildly fluid overloadedon admission. He was successfully diuresed with 100 IV Lasix forseveral days. The patient has been switched to his home dose ofLasix of 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was euvolemic for several daysprior to his discharge. His euvolemic weight on 8/10/07 was64.5 kilograms. His discharge weight will be reported in anaddendum. During this admission , he was continued on hisbeta-blocker. His calcium channel blocker and diltiazem wasdiscontinued during this admission given his likely restrictiveheart physiology with his new diagnosis of amyloid. The patientwas started on a nitrate during this admission in order to reducepreload. As mentioned above , the patient had a catheterizationwith an endomyocardial biopsy that was positive for amyloid. Apanel of other amyloid-related tests were also sent out. Ofnote , serum genetic amyloid testing was pending at the time ofdischarge. Of note , the patient had a serum immunofixation testthat was within normal limits. The patient had a urineimmunofixation test with a positive monoclonal spike with Lambdalight chain. The patient also had a serum-free light chain assaythat was equivocal/positive. The patient also had positiveproteinuria on a spot urine. The patient also had a bone marrowbiopsy done by Dr. Jarred Canner of MOMH in order to furtherdefine this subtype of amyloid that this patient has and in orderto facilitate a screening of his family members for amyloid. Healso had a bone marrow biopsy given the monoclonal spike on hisurine immunofixation test.C. Rhythm: The patient has a pacemaker originally put in forsick sinus syndrome. He is V-paced. The patient was discoveredto be in atrial fibrillation on this admission. On 7/9/07 , theEP Service changed the pacemaker setting to VVI given that thepatient was in atrial fibrillation and decreased the heart rateto the 60s-70s. The patient remained on telemetry throughout hisstay which was uneventful. The patient was also started onCoumadin for anticoagulation given his atrial fibrillation andthe diagnosis of amyloid. The patient remained subtherapeuticand on 7/11/07 , his INR was still subtherapeutic at 1.5 , and hewill most likely be discharged on Coumadin 3.5 mg every eveningwhich will be adjusted as necessary at the RehabilitationFacility.2. Infectious Disease: The patient presented with a mild cough.The patient had a fever on admit but was afebrile after one totwo days on antibiotics. The patient had no leukocytosis.Again , there was a question of pneumonia on the chest x-ray andhis clinical findings were suspicious for pneumonia. The patientreceived a five-day course of levofloxacin at 750 mg daily. Thecourse of antibiotics ended on 1/27/07 .  The patient had blood ,urine and sputum cultures which were negative.3. Heme: The patient has baseline anemia between hematocrit of31 and 32 which remained stable during his hospitalization. Thepatient also has a baseline thrombocytopenia with platelets atapproximately 170 which remained stable throughout hishospitalization and again the patient as stated above was startedon Coumadin during this admission for atrial fibrillation and foramyloid. The Coumadin was slowly increased up to 3.5 mg givensubtherapeutic INR. The patient had a bone marrow biopsy done on5/10/07 as mentioned above in order to further define theamyloid ??_?? and because of the monoclonal spike on the urineimmunofixation. The final results of the bone marrow biopsy arepending.4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. At first ,he was on his home dose of NPH insulin which was 20 unitssubcutaneous daily as well as an insulin sliding scale. Becauseof persistent hypoglycemia , the patient's NPH was reduced to 10units of NPH insulin subcutaneous daily.5. FEN: The patient had a low-salt diet and a 2-liter fluidrestriction and was seen by Nutrition inhouse.6. Renal: The patient had a creatinine of approximately 1.0which stayed stable throughout his hospitalization.7. GI: The patient has chronic LFT abnormalities likelysecondary to CHF; however , the etiology is uncertain.8. Question restless leg syndrome: On 2/19/07 , the patient wascomplaining of myoclonic jerks of his right leg which is an oldproblem. His general exam was within normal limits. He wasgiven a trial of magnesium supplementation inhouse for this.9. Low back , sacral pain: His low back pain appears to bechronic and it was treated with oxycodone successfully. Thepatient also was noted to have a skin tear on his right buttockwhich showed no signs of infection and a DuoDERM was placed overit for wound care. The patient also had a stage I sacraldecubitus ulcer and a DuoDERM was placed on it for wound care andfor protection.10. Prophylaxis: The patient was on DVT dose Lovenox inhouseand was also on Coumadin.11. Physical Therapy: Of note , the patient has a left BKA. Thepatient's family brought in his prosthetic leg as well as hiswalker. Physical Therapy inhouse worked with the patient , and itwas determined that the patient was unsafe to go home and it wasrecommended that he go to a rehabilitation facility to which thepatient finally agreed.CODE STATUS:The patient is full code.

The patient has had a long history of diabetes since1984 for which she has been treated with diet and glyburide withpoorly controlled blood sugars until Metformin was added inOctober of 1996. In the past five years the patient has alsobecome morbidly obese with a weight of greater than 200 pounds.Since 1995 she has noted development of significant bilateral lowerextremity swelling. In October of 1996 she was treated for diabeticstasis ulcers on both of her legs with cellulitis requiring home IVantibiotics. Part of the bilateral lower extremity swelling wasattributed to the presence of a large uterine fibroid which wasthought to be compromising venous return. Her massive edema wastreated unsuccessfully with Lasix.The patient was doing well until about a week prior to admissionwhen she developed some diarrhea consisting of two to three bowelmovements a day. Her stool was watery brown without any blood ormucus. She also reported some nausea and vomiting as well aschills. She believes that she had fevers , but these temperatureswere not measured. One day after the onset of her diarrhea thepatient noted the development of burning pain on her left anteriorthigh just above her knee. This was associated with increasederythema and mildly increased swelling in that area. She reportsthat her diarrhea , there had been stool running down her left thighthe previous day. This area of erythema on her left legsubsequently spread to the lateral surface of the thigh and wasassociated with increasing pain. The pain was so severe that itprevented the patient from her daily activities and from walking.The patient presented to the Emergency Department on 4/8 forworsening of her lower extremity pain and decreased p.o. intake.On the day of admission the patient states that her diarrhea hadresolved and that she has had no abdominal pain. She has had nochest pain or shortness of breath or any other localizing signs ofinfection except her left leg. On admission she was found to havea temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and she was placed in theShort Stay Unit. Subsequently her admission labs were noted toreveal elevated LFTs and an elevated BUN and creatinine with awhite blood cell count of 35 , 000. Because of these abnormalitiesand renal failure , the patient was transferred out of the ShortStay Unit to the General Medicine team for further care.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.Bilateral lower extremity edema with chronicvenous stasis changes. HIstory of cellulitis. History ofhypertension. Uterine fibroid. Hypercholesterolemia.Osteoarthritis. Hemoglobin C trace.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. Lisinopril 20 mgb.i.d. Lasix 80 mg q a.m. Metformin500 mg b.i.d. Naprosyn 375 mg b.i.d. p.r.n.MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM SHORT STAY UNIT: Ancef 1 gram IV q 8.Colace 100 mg b.i.d.Insulin sliding scale. Lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a sister with diabetes mellitus.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies alcohol , cigarettes , or druguse. The patient lives in Sa Na Oak and caresfor four young grandchildren.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese , pleasant , AfricanAmerican woman in no apparent distress. Hertemperature was 99.4 , blood pressure 110/74 , pulse rate of 92 ,respiratory rate 20 , O2 sat 96% on room air. Her HEENT exam wasnonicteric with moist oropharynx and no lesions. The neck wassupple without any lymphadenopathy. She had a right EJ IV line.There were no carotid bruits. Her lungs were clear to auscultationwith no CVA tenderness. Her heart was regular rate and rhythm.There was a faint S4 and a loud P2 component to the S2 sound. Herabdominal exam was obese , non-positive for bowel sounds. There wasmild tenderness over the periumbilical region with some fullness/suggestion of a mass. There was no rebound or guarding , no rightupper quadrant tenderness , no hepatomegaly/splenomegaly ( examlimited by obesity ). Her extremity exam revealed marked bilateralswelling in both lower extremities with chronic stasis changes.There were multiple venous plaques on the pretibial areas of bothlegs with one venous plaque being ulcerated on the right pretibarea. Examination of her left thigh revealed a patch of erythemaand warmth that was very tender to the touch. Neurologic exam wasalert and oriented times three , intact cranial nerves III-XII.There was slight decrease in sensation in the patient's lowerextremity , left greater than right to pin sensation. Her motorexam was otherwise unremarkable. Her rectal exam was reported tobe guaiac negative per the Emergency Department.LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION: Sodium 133 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 43 , andcreatinine of 3.7. The patient's lastcreatinine value on record was in September of 1996 which was 0.6. HerLFTs revealed an ALT of 71 , AST of 57 , LDH 717 , alkalinephosphatase 196 , total bilirubin 1.1 , direct bilirubin 0.6. Heramylase was 8. Her albumin was 2.1 and her calcium was 8.2. HerCBC on admission revealed a white cell count of 34 , 000 , hematocritof 29 , and platelets of 624 , 000. The differential on the whiteblood cell count was 78 polys , 38 bands , 6 lymphs , 3 monocytes , andno eos. Her MCV on her hematocrit was 77. Her PT and PTT wereboth within normal limits. Her urinalysis revealed 3+ protein , 1+leukocyte esterase , 8-12 white blood cells , 20-25 red blood cells ,and 2+ squamous epithelial cells.Chest x-ray on admission revealed low lung volumes with possibleleft total effusion that was blurring left lower lobe air spacedisease. Abdominal ultrasound performed on admission revealed nohydronephrosis , a normal liver biliary system. Study was limitedsecondary to body habitus. Lower extremity non-invasive studiesrevealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. However , exam waslimited secondary to habitus.HOSPITAL COURSE: By issues:1. Left thigh cellulitis: The patient was started on Ancefrenally dosed for her left thigh cellulitis. Her legs were keptraised and her white blood cell and fever curves followed. AnInfectious Disease consult as well as a Dermatology consult wasobtained to assist with antibiotics as well as dressing for herlower extremity changes. Blood cultures and wound cultures sentdid not reveal any organisms. Because of the patient's very highwhite blood cell count , the ID consult team was concerned for thepossibility of toxic shock syndrome; therefore , Clindamycin IV wasalso added to her regimen of antibiotics. Also per IDrecommendation , stool cultures were sent for E. coli 0167: H7 whichwas negative. Although there was an initial fall in the patient'swhite count during the first several days of antibiotics , thiswhite count subsequently began rising again. This was associatedwith continued poor resolution of the pain in the patient's leftthigh and perhaps worsening erythema. Because the patient's leftleg did not appear to be getting better on antibiotics , a Surgicalconsult was obtained to rule out a deeper seated infection in thepatient's thigh. Imaging of the patient's leg with MRI wasattempted but was unsuccessful secondary to the patient's largesize. A CT of both of her legs were obtained instead whichrevealed no evidence of an abscess in her left leg , however , it didincidentally detect a large effusion in the patient's left knee.One week after admission the patient noted acute worsening of thepain in her left knee. Because of the known left knee effusion , aconcern for a septic knee joint was raised. A Rheumatology consultwas obtained. The left knee was tapped using ultrasound guidanceremoving 20 cc of turbid knee fluid. Studies on the left kneeeffusion revealed 13 , 000 white blood cells with negative gram stainand negative crystal exam times 3. Cultures of the left knee fluiddid not grow any organisms. Despite these findings , we were stillconcerned that this was a partially treated septic joint given thepatient had been on antibiotics for one week. For this reason anOrthopedic consult was obtained and the patient was taken to the ORfor possible debridement. On 6/19 the patient was taken to theOperating Room where an abscess on the left lateral distal thighwas found and drained. A total of approximately 20 cc of pus wasremoved by Dr. Sudler . There was no connection between the puscollection and the left knee effusion. After the drainage , thepatient's clinical status improved dramatically with a decrease inher white count and increased mobility of her leg. She wascontinued on Ancef IV and p.o. Ofloxacillin which had been addedfor gram negative coverage. The Clindamycin was subsequentlydiscontinued. On the day prior to discharge the patient's whiteblood cell count had fallen to 10 , 000. She remained afebrile.2. Renal: On admission the patient was noted to have a creatinineof 3.7 with a baseline known to be 0.6 in September of 1996. However , onsearching through the patient's records it appears that the patienthad been noted to have increased proteinuria since September of 1996.The acute renal failure was initially thought to be secondary todehydration; the patient was given IV hydration with no improvementin her creatinine. For that reason , a Renal consult was obtainedon the third day of admission. It was the impression of the RenalService that the patient's acute renal failure was likelymultifactorial secondary to a combination of diabetic nephropathy ,low albumin , volume loss secondary to diarrhea , infection , andmedications which included NSAIDs as well as ACE inhibitor. Forthat reason , the patient's nephrotoxic medications , which includeLisinopril and Metformin , were discontinued. The patient'selectrolytes and volume status was followed closely for the rest ofthe course of the hospitalization with continued gradualimprovement. Her creatinine peaked at 4.7. On discharge thepatient's creatinine had resolved back to 2.2.3. Right upper extremity swelling: On the day after the patientreturned from the Operating Room for the drainage of her leftthigh , she was found to have new onset of swelling in her right armand breast. Initially we were concerned for the presence of aright upper extremity deep venous thrombosis. Upper extremitynon-invasive studies were obtained which were negative for anyclots. An echocardiogram was also obtained showing no evidence ofright heart dysfunction. A nuclear flow study was also attemptedbut was unsuccessful because of the failure to obtain venous accesson the patient's right arm. The Leahgulf Mary Katon Hospital team was alsoconsulted regarding the use of heparin. However , given that thepatient had poor access and had an anemia , it was decided that thepatient would not be heparinized. Her right upper extremityswelling was observed closely and with elevation of the right armover the next few days gradually resolved without anycomplications. On the day prior to discharge a repeat right upperextremity ultrasound was obtained which revealed no evidence ofblood clots in her right arm.4. Hematology: On admission the patient was found to have a lowhematocrit with a low MVC. Iron studies were performed whichrevealed the likely presence of iron deficiency. For that reasonthe patient was placed on iron sulfate 30 mg t.i.d. The patientwas guaiac negative , thus ruling out evidence of a chronic GIbleed. The patient's anemia is also likely a reflection of herrenal dysfunction.5. GI: Although the patient had experienced some diarrhea priorto admission , her diarrhea resolved in the hospital. All of herstool studies were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed noabnormalities in the patient's liver or biliary system to accountfor the mild transaminitis found on admission. It is likely thatthe patient had a bout of viral gastroenteritis a few days prior toadmission which resolved spontaneously.DISPOSITION: To Hi Health .DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ancef 1 gram IV q.8h. times 14 days.Ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. times 14 days.Lotrimin topical applied b.i.d. to toes and webs of toes. Nystatinpowder topical b.i.d. applied to groin area. Polysporin ointmenttopical applied to right pretibial ulcer with dressing. Ironsulfate 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. Atenolol 50 mg q day. Oxycodone 5-10mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain. Miracle Cream p.r.n. Colace 100 mgp.o. b.i.d.ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: The patient will require , at Mai Memorial Hospital ,dressing changes on her left leg p.r.n.saturation ( probably at least q shift ) with 4 x 8 Kerlix/ABDpads/Kerlix wrap with fine dry bulky soft dressing.The patient is discharged with IV Ancef for an additional 14 daysas well as p.o. Ofloxacin for 14 days. The patient will requirefollow-up with a doctor while at Hightalon Geer Of Health to determine changes inthe antibiotics regimen. As for the patient's right pretibialulcer , that will require daily wet to dry dressing with theapplication of Polysporin.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to be followed up by her primary MMCdoctor to be arranged.Dictated By: GENARO F.

The patient is a 67-year-old female withhistory of coronary artery disease who was first evaluated backin 2002 when she had a stent placed at THC for symptomaticcoronary artery disease. She reports feeling well until 10/14when she developed substernal chest burning and pressure and wasadmitted to Trowestpot Allch Memorial Hospital , where a dobutamine echo waspositive for ischemia , details unclear and she was transferred toIIAH for further care. At Deran Medical Center ,angiography was performed on 8/7/06 with placement of a Cypherstent in her LAD. The evening following discharge , the patientreported severe substernal chest pressure and activated her localEMS. On the way to the hospital , she suffered a Vfib arrhythmiarequiring CPR and 9 defibrillations. At Geft.o Ton Memorial Hospital ,she was acutely intervened upon with PTCA and found to have athrombosed LAD stent. At this point , she was transferred toR. Medical Center Of on an intraaortic balloon pump forsupport. Repeat angiography was performed revealing suboptimaldeployment of the initial stent , which was subsequently outsizedto a diameter of 3.5 mm and additional stenting was performeddistal to the original stent with good anterograde flow notedpostprocedure. The patient was managed in the CCU , where sheremained intubated on the intraaortic balloon pump. Hospitalcourse was notable for distributive and cardiogenic shock as wellas aspiration pneumonia and HSV , treated with acyclovir. Sheimproved after two weeks and was discharged on 5/14/06 with anEF of 40% at the time of discharge. The patient was readmittedto Tacan Hospital And on 6/16/06 with a CHF exacerbation , wassubsequently diuresed and discharged on 1/27/06 .Echocardiography at that time demonstrated an EF of 55% with 2 to3+ MR and RVSP of 45 mmHg. The patient represented to Harl Hospital on 9/23/06 reporting progressive dyspnea , weightgain , PND , orthopnea and cough. At that time , she underwentrepeat angiography demonstrating RA 14 , RV 55/13 , PA 61/25/42 ,PCWP 35 with V 246 , LHC with AO 86/57. Angiography revealed aright dominant circulation and LMCA , which was patent , LAD 20%mid , D1 40% , ostial left circumflex 20% mid , RCA 60% prox , LVgram with an EF of 25% associated with global hypokinesis andsevere MR. The patient was subsequently transferred to Palm Health Systems for further management of her advanced heart failure.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant in addition to above forhypertension , type 2 diabetes on insulin , obesity , COPD ,hyperlipidemia , GERD , hypothyroidism , depression , status postappendectomy and status post cholecystectomy.MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: Include aspirin 325 daily , Lasix 80 mgIV b.i.d. , Diovan 160 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , levothyroxine88 mcg daily , Lipitor 20 mg daily , Zetia 10 mg daily , Aldactone25 mg daily , Protonix 20 mg daily , Advair 500/50 one puff dailyand insulin 70/30 , 30 units subq b.i.d.ALLERGIES: Include erythromycin.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband and works ina clothing company. She smokes 1-2 packs per day x46 years untilnine years ago. No alcohol use. No illicits.FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports coronary artery disease inone sibling.

No changes in mentalstatus or loss of consciousness , no dysuria , no exposures. Norecent travel. No presyncope or dizziness.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for creatinine of 1 frombaseline of 0.7 to 0.8. Hematocrit of 34 , baseline 37. ALT 68 ,AST 33 and alkaline phosphatase 384 down from 616 on lastadmission. INR 1. EKG , sinus rhythm at 90 , normal axisintervals with old anterior septal MI.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for afebrile , heart rate in the90s , blood pressure 98/60 , respiratory rate 18-20 , satting 98% on3 liters. The patient was in no acute distress , pleasant ,resting comfortably. Oropharynx clear. JVP 10 cm with 2+carotids without bruits. No thyromegaly , no lymphadenopathy.Decreased breath sounds with bibasilar crackles with prolongedexpiratory phase and intermittent expiratory wheezing. Regularrate and rhythm , S1 and S2. Notable S3 , no MR appreciated.Abdomen was obese , distended , soft , nontender , nohepatosplenomegaly. Positive bowel sounds.

Cathsite clean , dry , intact. Neurologic exam is nonfocal.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary , this is a 67-year-old femalewith multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension ,hyperlipidemia , diabetes , coronary artery disease status post LADstent complicated by a subacute thrombosis with marked leftventricular dysfunction with a reportedly revascularized rightcoronary territory and severe MR on repeat echo. Despitediuresis at the outside hospital , the patient remained volumeoverloaded with biventricular failure on exam. The patient wasadmitted to medically optimized heart failure regimen to furtherclarify component of mitral regurgitation. Repeat TTE and rightand left heart catheterization to further evaluate and optimizemedical management. The patient was maintained on aspirin ,Plavix , ARB , statin and Zetia. Beta-blocker was continued at lowdose given decompensated state. Adenosine MIBI was completed ,which was notable for recovery 1 mm ST depressions in leads II ,III and aVF , which resolved. There is no further evidence ofischemia. EF was notable to be severely depressed; however ,moderate MR on outside hospital echo was not reproducible here.Cardiovascular surgery was initially consulted to furtherevaluate for benefit of mitral valve replacement surgery;however , this will likely not be of benefit given mild MR onrepeat echo. In addition a contrast echo was performed tofurther evaluate for evidence of clot given the severe rightventricle malfunction , and anticoagulation was started; however ,there was no evidence of clot on echo. In addition , on echo ,reevaluated for dyssynchrony , which was negative. The patientwas diuresed with IV Lasix until near euvolemic and thentransitioned to p.o. regimen. The patient was maintained onAldactone. The EP service evaluated for possible placement ofAICD versus biventricular pacemaker; however , given the patientis not yet outside of three-month window and was noninducible onEP study , she will need close monitoring as an outpatient withrepeat echo in 2 months and a further EP study to readdress. Thepatient will be anticoagulated in the meantime. Respiratory:The patient has history of COPD with no evidence of acuteexacerbation. Inhalers were continued. PFTs and VO2 study maybe considered as an outpatient. Renal: Creatinine was mildlyelevated compared with baseline , likely secondary to mild dyenephropathy and overaggressive diuresis. Creatinine stabilized ,will need to be followed closely as an outpatient as well aselectrolytes. GI. The patient was maintained on a bowelregimen. LFTs were elevated on admission consistent with rightheart failure versus statin. LFTs trended down on admission.Hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable at baseline. Thepatient will remain on heparin to Coumadin bridge with Lovenoxbridge as an outpatient if needed. Endocrine: The patient has ahistory of poorly controlled diabetes and was maintained oninsulin as an inpatient with sliding scale coverage. History ofhypothyroidism , on Levoxyl. TSH within normal limits. ID: Noacute issues. The patient was treated for asymptomaticbacteriuria secondary to possible permanent pacemaker placement.She developed itchiness , which is likely secondary to theBactrim. Provided supportive care , the patient should avoidBactrim in the future secondary to intolerance. No seriousreactions were observed. Psychiatric: The patient has a historyof depression. She was continued on home medications. FEN: Thepatient was maintained on a cardiac diet with sodium and volumerestriction , K mag scales. Nutrition was consulted.Dermatologic: The patient has a history of HSV , status postacyclovir treatment. No evidence of further infection. Thepatient had pretibial erythema , which derm was consulted for ,which they felt was consistent with venous stasis. She improvedwith steroid cream and compression. The patient was prophylaxedwith Protonix and heparin. The patient was instructed to followup with cardiology , weigh herself daily with careful notice toweight gain reporting to the physician and to returne to the EDwith worsening shortness of breath or chest pain. The patientwas instructed to follow a fluid restricted , low-fat ,low-cholesterol diet as well as a restricted sodium diet. Shewill follow up with her PCP Dr. Kuhnke at 786-179-5001 on1/4/06 at 2:45.

Evaluation revealed a small right knee effusionconsistent with mechanical derangement secondary to obesity. Thetap was negative for crystals and had negative cultures. Thepatient was initially supposed to go home , however due toinadequate support , she was kept overnight on the evening of September , 1996. Overnight she received Vistaril , Percocet as well assome Demerol and Oxycodone. On the morning of March , 1996 , shewas found to be unresponsive with bloody saliva dripping from hermouth. A Code Green was called. They were unable to find a bloodpressure. The patient was intubated. Dopamine was started.Narcan was given. The blood pressure recovered. The patientawakened and the patient's initial arterial blood gas prior tointubation was 7.04 pH , pCO2 137 and pO2 of 85 and she wassubsequently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant fora restrictive lung disease. Past pulmonaryfunction tests revealed an FEV of 1.8 which is in the 56thpercentile and FEV1 of 1.6 which is in the 59th percentile , TLC of3.3 in the 54th percentile and DLCO at 116th percentile. She hasbeen on long term home oxygen with oxygen saturation between 85%and 90% on two liters of nasal cannula. Arterial blood gases onprior admissions have revealed pO2 in 50 , pCO2 in the high 40s tolow 50s. She has a history of obstructive sleep apnea. She hasbeen evaluated in the past with even trace apnea screen in Augustof 1994 which revealed approximately 19 apnea events in just over10 hours. The oxygen saturation decreased to 61% at the minimumand subsequently she had respiratory monitoring in September of 1995 withC-PAP which revealed a decrease in the apnea episodes to 19 eventsin about 480 minutes with oxygen saturation decreasing to a minimumof 71%. Apparently , by report , attempts had been made to start thepatient on the C-PAP at home , but the patient had been resistantand she has a long history of medical non-compliance. She has ahistory of recurrent deep venous thromboses in which she has hadmultiple medical admissions , most recently about six in the pastyear , most recently in October of 1996 , for cellulitis of the leftlower extremity , in July of 1996 , bilateral calf tenderness withnegative non-invasive studies and in September of 1996 , most recentlywith right lower extremity cellulitis and this was complicated byapparent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare. The patienthas had multiple VQ scans in the past , all of which have been lowprobability. The patient has been on chronic Coumadin , howeverthere is a question of whether or not , she has been taking itregularly. There has also been a question in the past of possiblediastolic dysfunction. In September of 1994 , she had anechocardiogram which showed some left ventricular hypertrophy , noregional wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction ofapproximately 55% , no right ventricular hypertrophy or tricuspidregurgitation. Other past medical history includes a history ofdepression. The patient has been managed with Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.day. She is status post midline hernia repair. She is status postbilateral tubal ligation. The patient has chronic hypoxemia ,obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , chronic lower extremity deepvenous thromboses and obstructive lung disease.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Diltiazem 120 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )Albuterol 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n. 4 ) K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q. day. 5 )Axid 150 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6 ) Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q. day. 7 ) Lasix20 mg p.o. q. day. 8 ) Coumadin alternating 10 mg with 7.5 mg p.o.q. day.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for the patient living alone. Sheoccasional has her son stay with her. She isdivorced and she has refused chronic care in the past.HABITS: Positive for cigarettes about a 20 pack year history. Noalcohol , no intravenous drugs.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Pulmonary: The patient was admitted to theMedical Intensive Care Unit on March , 1996status post a respiratory arrest thought to be secondary tohypercarbia through the combination of the patient's underlyinglung disease as well as excessive sedation. She was intubated onMarch , 1996 and quickly extubated on April , 1996 withoutcomplications. Her chest x-ray on admission was significant for amild interstitial pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Afterextubation , the patient was weaned to bi-PAP with which she wasable to maintain saturations between 86-90% while in the MedicalIntensive Care Unit. The patient was transferred to the floor onFebruary , 1996. Given the patient's history of restrictive lungdisease , it was thought that it was time to have a full work-up tosearch for a possible etiologies , questioning possible obesity vs.parenchymal disease. She had an echocardiogram on August , 1996 ,which revealed an ejection fraction of 75% , mild left ventricularhypertrophy , no regional wall motion abnormalities , a top normalsized right ventricle , trace tricuspid insufficiency and asuggested pulmonary arterial pressure in the range of 36 mm ofMercury plus the estimated right atrial pressure. Thisechocardiogram was performed with a bubble study and there was noobvious intra-cardiac shunt either by color doppler or salineinfusion. They were unable to exclude diastolic dysfunction giventhe presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Her chest CT onAugust , 1996 was significant for cardiomegaly and pulmonaryedema , patchy opacities in the right apex and lung bases with anodular quality of unclear etiology and a lucent lesion in theright lobe of the liver that was too small to characterize. Inorder to further help sort out the etiology of her restrictive lungdisease , the patient underwent a PA gram on September , 1996 to ruleout the possibility of chronic pulmonary emboli. This studyrevealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli. She had a normalpulmonary vascular distribution , elevated right heart pressureswith pulmonary arterial pressure of 44/13 with a mean of 28 mm ofMercury , right ventricular pressure 52/2 with a mean of 20 mm ofMercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23. ThePulmonary Service had been consulted and it was thought that it wasdifficult to sort out exactly what was going on. It was unclearwhat the nodular lesions described on the CT represented , whetherit was inflammation or some sort of firm nodule. It was decided tofollow-up on the CT in the future and to have the patient had arepeat sleep study as well as repeat pulmonary function tests. Theoverall impression was that her restrictive lung disease was mostlikely secondary to obesity. While the patient was on the floor ,we attempted to restart her on the bi-PAP , however the patientresisted using both the C-PAP and the bi-PAP practically everynight complaining that she had an upper respiratory infection thatmade it difficult for her to wear the machine. On the evening thatshe did actually try both the C-PAP and the bi-PAP , she was notedto have labored breathing with the C-PAP at 5 mm of Mercury andfour liters nasal cannula with a pulse oximetry dropping to 81%.When she switched to bi-PAP with settings of 12 mm of Mercuryinspiratory and 7 mm of Mercury expiratory , she was able tomaintain oxygen saturations between 88% and as high as 93% oxygensaturation. Her oxygen saturations throughout hospitalizationranged between 91-93% on two liters nasal cannula during the dayand as well as 88% overnight. It was decided that the patientgiven her history would require bi-PAP on discharge as well as herhome oxygen.2 ) Infectious Disease: The patient as noted above spiked atemperature to 101 degrees on March , 1996 while in the MedicalIntensive Care Unit and subsequently never had elevatedtemperatures nor an elevated white blood cell count. She wasstarted on Clindamycin and Ofloxacin intravenously and thenswitched to p.o. on February , 1996 to complete a ten day course.On March , 1996 , the patient as stated , remained afebrilethroughout her hospitalization and never had an elevated whiteblood cell count. She did complain of upper respiratory symptomsbeginning on February , 1996 described as general head fullness ,sinus tenderness and nasal congestion. She was started on Afrin 2puffs b.i.d. for three days with some relief as well as Robitussinand Sudafed. Her physical examination was notable some maxillarysinusitis and the patient was actually discharged after a brieftime on Afrin nasal spray.3 ) Cardiovascular: Echocardiogram was performed during thisadmission and is as described above. The patient remainedhemodynamically stable throughout this admission.4 ) Hematology: The patient had a history of recurrent lowerextremity deep venous thromboses. She was maintained on Heparinuntil all of her procedures had been completed and was restarted onCoumadin on September , 1996. Her PT and PTT were followed untilthe point that she had established a therapeutic INR. On August , 1996 , her PT and PTT were notable for a PT of 17.5 with a PTTof greater than 200 and INR of 2.2. Heparin was discontinued and arepeat PTT on the evening of July , 1996 revealed a PT of 18.5and a PTT of 67.6 and an INR of 2.5. She was discharged the nextday on 7.5 mg of Coumadin q.h.s. Of note , the patient had beenadmitted with about a 2 X 2 cm ulcer of her medial left malleoluswhich appeared to heal well with granulation and scarred by thetime she had been discharged.5 ) Rheumatology: The patient as noted was admitted for evaluationof right knee pain. The patient did not complain of right painsubsequent to her discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.Her cultures and crystals were negative and she is to follow-up asan outpatient with the Rheumatologist in their clinic.6 ) Endocrine: The patient maintained stable bowel sounds onGlyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day.7 ) Gastrointestinal: The patient remained stable and was able totolerate a low cholesterol , low saturated fat diet and wasmaintained on Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. However , on the date ofdischarge , the patient was complaining of a burning sensation inher throat after drinking orange juice which tended to come and go ,but did not radiate and she was switched from Axid to Prilosec 20mg p.o. q. day on March , 1996.8 ) Gynecology: While on the floor , the patient startedcomplaining of some vaginal spotting. She has menopausal since her40s and has had not had any recent gynecological following. It wasdecided for the patient to either follow-up with her primary carephysician or with the GYN clinic at N'ssciences Memorial Hospital for evaluation of this spotting for ruling out endometrialcarcinoma.9 ) Neurological: The patient did not demonstrate any evidence ofdepression and was stable on Zoloft.10 ) General Care: The patient underwent Physical Therapy andOccupational Therapy throughout the hospitalization. It wasthought that she would benefit greatly from inpatient pulmonaryrehabilitation or possibly weight loss reduction , however thepatient repeatedly declined pulmonary rehabilitation and weightloss reduction and felt that she would be able to manage herself athome.The patient was discharged on March , 1996 in stable conditionto home with VNA services to follow-up on her blood sugars , herhome oxygen as well as her bi-PAP.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. 5 )Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6 ) Ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. timesone day. 7 ) Clindamycin 200 mg p.o. q. 6h. times one day. 8 )Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q. day. 9 ) Potassium chloride slow release 20mEq p.o. q. day. 10 ) Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 4-6h. p.r.n. pain.11 ) Maalox 50 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n. indigestion. 12 ) Albuterolinhaler 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d. p.r.n. wheezing. 13 ) Afrin 2 puffsb.i.d. times three days.FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Isidro Ernesto Laurila onAugust , 1996. She also had an appointment on January , 1996 with the GYN Clinic. Pulmonary follow-up is as follows:On February , 1996 at 9:00 AM , she is to have a repeat CT tofollow-up the nodularities found on the most recent CT. OnFebruary , 1996 at 10:30 AM , she is to have a pulmonary functiontest and to follow-up at 11:30 AM with the Pulmonary Clinic. Sheis to call Rheumatology at her convenience.The patient was to proceed with bi-PAP , however due to theneed for medical assistance , she may not receive it for another twoweeks and is to continue with her home oxygen.Dictated By: CLARENCE J.

HISTORY OF PULMONARY EMBOLI IN 1971AND IN 1988.2. HISTORY OF STREP PHARYNGITIS IN JulyOF 1994 , TREATED WITH PENICILLIN.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54 year old female witha history of pulmonary emboli in thepast , now with complaint of four days of pleuritic chest pain andleft arm heaviness. Coronary risk factors include a positivefamily history , no smoking , diabetes mellitus , hypertension orelevated cholesterol. The patient's history begins in 1971 when ,after a tubal ligation , she had a pulmonary emboli which was feltto be secondary to prolonged bedrest. She received Heparin and wascoumadinized for one year. In 1988 she had lower abdominal pain ,extensive work up of which revealed a pulmonary emboli , and againshe was heparinized and coumadinized for one year. On September , 1994she developed the acute onset of intermittent chest pressure andleft arm heaviness , associated with night sweats. There was noshortness of breath , palpitations , light-headedness , nausea orvomiting. The pain was exacerbated by deep breaths as well asyawning and movement. It was not relieved by any factors. On themorning of admission the discomfort progressed from intermittent toconstant and was unrelieved with two Advils , at which time shesubsequently presented to the W.coness- County General HospitalEmergency Ward. In the Emergency Ward her examination wasnegative. Chest x-ray was negative. VQ scan was with intermediateprobability. She received Heparin and was subsequently transferredto the floor. She denied any fevers , chills , cough , shortness ofbreath , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal pain or dysuria. It isnoteworthy that the patient had an Emergency Ward visit on Aprilat which time she complained of sore throat. Rapid Strep test waspositive for Strep pharyngitis. She was treated with a course ofPenicillin. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is asabove. She also has a history of dysfunctional uterine bleeding ,iron deficiency anemia , lumbosacral disc disease , status postlaminectomy times three. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Medications onadmission are Motrin prn. ALLERGIES: She has no known drugallergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Her mother died from complicationsfrom hypertension. Her father died from a cerebrovascularaccident. She has one sister who is deceased from burn injuries ,one brother who passed away from a myocardial infarction at age 57 ,and two brothers who passed away from natural causes. SOCIALHISTORY: She is a clerk. She is divorced with five children. Shenever smoked. She drinks alcohol occasionally. She has no HIVrisk factors and no known TB exposures.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination she is awell-developed , well-nourished femaleappearing her stated age and in no apparent distress. Temperatureis 98 , pulse 94 , blood pressure 140/88 , and respirations 16. Heentshows extraocular movements were intact. Oropharynx revealed noerythema , edema or exudate. Mucous membranes were moist. Neck wassupple with no lymphadenopathy. Carotids were 2+ bilaterally.Lungs revealed right basilar rales. Coronary examination revealeda regular rate and rhythm with positive S1 and S2 and no S3 or S4.There were no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen is soft andnon-tender with positive bowel sounds. There was nohepatosplenomegaly or masses noted. Rectal was guaiac negative inthe Emergency Ward. Extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis oredema. Neurological examination was non-focal.LABORATORY DATA: Sodium was 142 , potassium 4.1 , BUN 15 , creatinine.8 , and glucose 74. Liver function tests werewithin normal limits. CK was 697 with an MB of 8.5. White countwas 4.1 , hematocrit 37 and platelet count was 252 , 000. PT was12.5 , PTT 29.3. Chest x-ray , which was a portable film , was clear.VQ scan was read as intermediate probability. EKG revealed a sinusbradycardia at 54 with normal axis and intervals. She had flippedT waves in leads 3 , F , and V1 through V3 , biphasic T waves in V4 ,flat T waves in V5 and V6. There was poor R wave progression and Qwaves in 1 and L.HOSPITAL COURSE: It was felt that during the patient'spresentation the most likely diagnosis was apulmonary embolus , given her clinical history and her intermediateprobability of VQ scan. The elevated CK with the very low MB wasfelt not to represent a myocardial infarction but to represent a CKleak from presumed pulmonary infarction. The patient washeparinized with the goal of maintaining her PTT in the 60 to 80range. She had a thrombotic work up sent off , namely anantithrombin 3 , protein C and protein S , all of which , with theexception of the Russell viper venom , returned within normallimits. The Russell viper venom is pending at the time ofdictation. The patient underwent lower extremity noninvasives onhospital day number one which returned as negative. She had a Ddimer sent which was also normal. At this point the DVT Team hereat the Otver Hospital was consulted , given theconflicted data for pulmonary emboli. The team felt that , giventhe patient's clinical history and the implications of chronicCoumadin therapy , that a pulmonary embolus should be definitelyruled out by pulmonary arteriogram. On hospital day number two thepatient underwent a PA gram which revealed a mean RA pressure of 7mm of mercury , a mean RV pressure of 12 mm of mercury , and nofilling defects to suggest a pulmonary embolus. At this point thepatient's Heparin was discontinued. The day prior to obtaining thepulmonary arteriogram the patient had a good PA and lateral film ,which revealed no focal infiltrates and no effusions. On hospitalday number three the patient underwent an echocardiogram whichrevealed normal left ventricular size and mild left ventricularhypertrophy with vigorous function and no regional wall motionabnormalities. She had no pericardial thickening or pericardialeffusion to suggest pericarditis. She had structurally normalcardiac valves , no significant mitral or tricuspid regurge. Shehad a minimal amount of aortic regurgitation and normal right heartsize and function. At this point , given the fact that the patientwas not felt to have a myocardial infarction , given her low MBtotal CK ratio , and also that she was not felt to have a pulmonaryembolus , given the negative PA gram , the diagnosis of pleurisysecondary to possible close viral syndrome was considered. Thepatient was started on Naprosyn at 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. on hospitalday number three , to which she responded quite well. Afterdiscussion with the patient's primary doctor it was felt that ,given the fact that serious causes for pleuritic chest pain hadbeen ruled out , the patient's management could be followed in anoutpatient setting. On hospital day number four it was felt thatshe was safe to be discharged to home. Operations and proceduresperformed during this hospitalization were pulmonary arteriogram byPa Hospital on April , 1994. There were no complications.DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Discharge medicationsinclude Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. with meals. Thepatient is being discharged to home. FOLLOW UP: She will followup with Dr. Owen Albertine on August , 1994 at 1:30 p.m.Dictated By: RUDY EZZO , M.D. XR88Attending: BRITT FOGAL , M.D. FI6  AJ459/1237Batch: 2358 Index No. CNUD121UE D: 9/20/94T: 5/30/94

No alcohol userecently.FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a MI at 73. Her mother died inher 80s of emphysema.LABORATORY DATA: The patient had a creatinine of 1 , her ALT was25 , AST was 35 , her hematocrit was 33 , her white count was 6.6 ,and her platelets were 241 , 000. She had normal differential.Her albumin was 3.5. Her urinalysis was dark , with 3+leukoesterase , negative nitrates , greater than 200 white bloodcells per high peripheral , 2-4 red blood cells per highperipheral , 1+ bacteria. Her EKG showed a sinus rhythm of 100.Her left bundle branch block with a QTc of 500 , but no changecompared to baseline.Her head CT showed an old right middle cerebral artery implant.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for initialpresentation with somnolence and altered mental status with onehypotensive blood pressure by EMS , but subsequently nohypotension in the absence of fluid resuscitation. Her urineculture appeared to indicate an infection , and so she was coveredwith antibiotics initially. It was also determined that she hada significant polypharmacy and enumerable sedating medications ather rehabilitation and there was suspicion that the medicationscontributed to her initial presentation of somnolence and alteredmental status.1. Infectious disease: The patient was initially treated withvancomycin for a presumed repeated MRSA UTI. However , her urineculture did not grow any bacteria , it only drew out yeast. Thus ,she was transitioned over to a ciprofloxacin 700 mg p.o. b.i.d.regime for a total of 12 days for a presumed urinary tractinfection.2. F/E/N: She was tolerating oral food and medications and aNutrition consult was obtained. She had calorie counts whichshowed adequate intake. She did not have any other metabolicabnormality that required correction.3. Cardiovascular: The patient's primary cardiovascularabnormality was a prolonged QTc which occurred in the setting ofprior use of Haldol and other antipsychotics for behavioralmodification. Her QTc was monitored with serial EKGs. Thelongest it had reached was 530 ms. Haldol was discontinued inorder to preserve the QTc. In addition , she was given someamounts of Seroquel and her QTc was continued to be monitored.4. Heme/Oncology: The patient has a history of stage IIInon-small cell lung cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy andis followed by her outpatient oncologist , as well as theoutpatient psychosocial oncology social worker , as well as thepsychosocial oncology physician whose name is Chet Nave .5. Neurological: The patient is status post both a large rightMCA stroke , as well as a right-sided carotid endarterectomy froma previous admission. Her neurological deficits are consistentwith her prior neurological deficits. Specifically , they includea left-sided hemiparesis , as well as agnosia on the left side.Her mental status included intermittent disorientation. She wasgenerally at her best , alert and oriented to herself , as well asher age , as well as her location in the Domo Ings Hospital .  However , she would intermittently loose track of whereher location was and believed that she was in Naimas West Hospital , not inthe hospital. She was also intermittently confused. She also iscomplicated , given her histories of seizures and stroke. It wasconsidered initially that her altered mental status was due topolypharmacy. However , her sedating medications werediscontinued including her Reglan was discontinued as well as herbaclofen , Dilaudid and trazodone. Her Cymbalta was continued perthe recommendations of the Psychiatry consult. The psychiatricconsultants also suggested a one-to-one sitter. At no time wasthe patient actively suicidal or homicidal. It was also laterdecided that her Dilaudid would be discontinued. In addition ,her standing Seroquel was made p.r.n. In addition , thepatient's family also suggested that the patient's base mentalstatus did not improve despite removing all the medications. Atthis point , a Neurology consult was obtained. This Neurologyconsult is pending at the time of this dictation and will bereported in a later dictation. Given the patient's history ofcomplex seizures and olfactory hallucinations , she was continuedon her Lamictal , as well as her Cymbalta , which was for herhistory of depression.6. Pain: The patient's pain in her left hand existed and shewas treated with tramadol and Tylenol for this pain. She couldnot specifically describe this pain.7. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on Novolog slidingscale for diabetes. She was also continued on a replacement doselevothyroxine for her history of Graves' and a history ofradioiodine ablation. For behavioral modification , as well asfor intermittent agitation and disorientation , the patient wasmaintained on p.r.n. Seroquel 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , as well asZydis 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. This was titrated from standing top.r.n. over the course of her hospitalization in order to try todecrease any sedating medications that may be altering heralertness and orientation.NOTE: This dictation will be addended at a later date withdischarge medications , as well as further hospital course and thepatient's neurological state , as well as any follow up that is tobe planned.eScription document: 2-3434562 SSSten TelDictated By: OCHILTREE , RYANAttending: LAMORE , SERGIODictation ID 7312284D: 11/22/06T: 11/22/06

However , subsequently , she began to haveseveral episodes of vomiting that was initially clear and thenturned brown with some dark blood in the morning. The patientdenies any bright red blood per rectum or melena. In the emergencydepartment , the patient had a negative NG lavage and treated withCompazine. She was also seen by Surgery whose initial assessmentwas Flagyl related emesis and changing antibiotics to levofloxacinand clindamycin. Gastrointestinal was also consulted who felt thatthe blood was most likely from a Mallory-Weiss tear.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , hypertension , anemia , status postcholecystectomy , status post appendectomy ,small bowel obstruction , bilateral cataracts , bilateral tuballigation , diverticulitis , chronic renal failure.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.4 , heart rate88 , blood pressure 156/116 sitting , standing169/74.

INR was 1.2 , PTT 26.6. BUN andcreatinine were 36 and 4.4 respectively. Amylase was 56 , lipase151 , total bilirubin 0.3 , alkaline phosphatase 103.HOSPITAL COURSE: Because of persistent nausea and vomiting despitehaving stopped the Flagyl and decreased dose oflevofloxacin on April , 2000 , the levofloxacin was discontinued.The patient had a gastric emptying study which was within normallimits and did not show any evidence of gastroparesis. On January , 2000 , an upper endoscopy was done that revealed two discreteesophageal ulcerations in the distal esophagus with surroundingesophageal erythema , most likely consistent with pill esophagitis.The patient was started on Prilosec 40 mg b.i.d. and antibioticswere stopped at that time as she had completed a ten day course.In addition , the patient also had problems with hypertension to the200s. This was treated with labetalol. Renal MRI study was donethat was negative for renal artery stenosis. The patient wasdischarged home in stable condition.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Lasix 160 mg p.o. q. day , NPH 40 unitssubcutaneously q. AM , regular insulin 10units subcutaneously q.

It should be noted at that timethat the patient's creatinine bumped before his operation from aBUN of 39 and a creatinine of 2.1 to a BUN of 59 on hospital day3 and a creatinine of 3.9. This occurred coincidentally the dayafter the patient had several MRIs of is lower extremities tobetter understand the vascular supply to his lower extremities.Therefore , the patient had contrast dye. Although , this dye wasgadolinium , which is sued commonly for MRA and is not usuallyassociated with any soft of renal toxicities.The patient was taken to the operating room on hospital day 3 fora right fourth and fifth toe amputation and nonhealing ulcerdebridement. Please refer to the operative note by Dr.Guemmer for further details. The patient tolerated theprocedure without any problems and the patient control wasadequate by postoperative day 1. However on postoperative labcheckup , it was see that the patient's creatinine bumped to 4.9with a BUN of 61. This was viewed and was monitored by serialBUN and creatinine checks. The following , BUN and creatininecame back at 69 for BUN and 5.2 for creatinine. On postoperativeday #1 , the patient's creatinine continued to rise and was foundto be 6.5 with a BUN of 81. At this point , the renal service wasconsulted for further input as far as possible causes of acuterenal failure in the phase of chronic renal insufficiency andpostoperative period. The patient's vancomycin level came to bein the therapeutic range of 30.8. FENa was checked whichrevealed 0.74% FENa. This was rechecked and revealed a FENa of0.97% both , which indicated prerenal failure. Renal team alsoadvised checking for other causes of the patient's anemia as wellas other causes of the renal failure. Labs have been sent andsome are currently pending regarding the C3-C4 and anti-GMBantibodies.The patient's creatinine continued to rise despite advancedmanagement including with IV resuscitation , fluid volume boluses ,and occasional boluses of Lasix. Eventually , the patient's BUNand creatinine rose to 94 and 8.3 by postoperative day 2. By thefollowing day , however postoperative day 3 , the patient'screatinine and BUN began resolving that BUN of 95 and acreatinine 7.8. However , at the same time , the patient beganhaving hypoglycemic episodes in response to the Lantus dose thathe was getting at home and continue to get here in hospital. Itwas summarized by the renal team as well as by the surgicalservice and that the patient may have not been taking hismedication at home and now was being his medications , while herein the hospital. By postoperative day 4 , the patient continuedto have dysregulation of his fingerstick blood glucoses rangingfrom a high of 367 to a low of 52 where she began to besymptomatic , somewhat somnolent , and groggy.This patient's blood glucose control was evaluated by thediabetes management service and it was summarized by them thatthe patient's renal insufficiency had a significant role in thepatient's hypoglycemic episodes and that he ended up havinginsulin toxicity due to poor creatinine clearance and renalfunctioning level. It should be noted that in light of thispatient's postoperative complications of acute renal failure inthe phase of chronic renal failure and chronic renalinsufficiency , the patient never required a hemodialysis becausethe potassium levels remained stable. The high that the patientreached was 5.6 of potassium on the same day that he had acreatine of 8.3 , which was on postoperative day #2 , This wastreated with kayexalate and along the same lines , the patient'smedications were evaluated and it was decided to decrease it tob.i.d. dosing and to start holding lisinopril , Neurontin , andvancomycin for their possible renal toxic effects. A renalultrasound was obtained on postoperative day #1 as well asDoppler flow studies. The renal ultrasound revealed normalparenchyma with somewhat decreased renal indices indicating somedecreased amount of blood flow to their kidneys. At the sametime , an MRA of the renal arteries was obtained which revealed nostenosis lesions of the kidneys.The patient was eventually started on PhosLo and Ferrlecit aswell as Epogen 10 , 000 units q. week at the recommendation of therenal service. This was continued during the duration of thepatient's stay and should continue in the postoperativehospitalization. In light of this postoperative complications ,the creatinine became stable by postoperative day 3 and bloodpressure medications were restarted at previous doses and weretitrated to the need that the patient demonstrated by his bloodpressure control. This was eventually attained on atenolol at150 mg q.d. However , renal service recommended that the patientbe given Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. This seems to have controlledthe patient's blood pressure for the time being. Physicaltherapy was also involved in evaluating the patient and assistedin the management of this patient's care.It should also be noted that a wax sponge was placed on thepatient's right open wound. This was placed on postoperative day#3 , 4/18/04 .  The patient seems to be tolerating this well. Thediabetes management service , the physical therapy , and the renalteams continued to follow the patient closely during the durationof his stay until it was felt that the patient's postoperativecomplications and issues including blood glucose control as wellas renal insufficiency were under control. From an operativestandpoint , the patient tolerated the procedure well and it wasdecided to continue the patient on levofloxacin for a one weekcourse and the patient is to be discharged to the rehab facility ,which is the Still Freedral Hospital for their ability tocare for wax sponge excellently.The patient was seen by Dr. Ulvan in the renal staff and by thediabetes management service by Dr. Clint Holets , pager #596-76. Thephysical examination at the time of discharge was unchanged fromthe previous few days where the patient was seen to have adequateDoppler signal in all his pedal pulses , DPs as well as PTs and afaintly palpable right DP and as well as faintly palpable leftDP.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:The patient is to be discharged on the following medications ,Tylenol 650 to 1000 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. for temperature greaterthan 101 , allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 81mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , PhosLo 1334 mg p.o.q.a.c. , please give with meals , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Epogen10 , 000 units delivered subcuticularly q. week starting on Monday ,already given one dose intra hospital stay.

Cr came down from 5.3 to nearnl w/ hydration suggesting prerenal etiology. Urine examined undermicroscope was without red blood cell casts. On presentation , pt. had noacute indication for dialysis. He was not uremic , had no rub , had goodurine output , had mild acedemia , and had normal K.As noted , his Cr camedown to near normal with hydration.*bladder mass* A bladder mass surrounded by blood clots was identified onthe patient's admission CT. Due to conern for bladder cancer , urinecytology was sent. Results are pending. On 8/19 , the urology teamperformed a cystoscopy which revealed a large bladder stone surrounded byhemorrhage. The clot was evacuated and the stone was broken up byelectrohydraulic lithotripsy. Biopsy samples weretaken from the inflamed bladder wall. Pathology results are pending. A3-way foley catheter was placed and continuous bladder irrigation wasinitiated. The patient received peri-procedure antibiosis with ancef andgent. The large size of the bladder stone suggests urinary retension ,perhaps due to persistent BPH ( despite 2000 TURP ). The patient was startedon flomax and proscar , as recommended by the urology team. The patient wasdischarged with a foley catheter in place. He will return to NC urologyclinics on 10/22 for a voiding trial.CV:pump*HTN* In house , pt. was treated with norvasc and lopressor. He wasdischarged on norvasc and toprol XL. Ace inhibition was not initiated dueto the patient's renal insufficiency.*murmur* On exam , pt. had a systolic ejection murmur heard best at theR and L upper sternal border and radiating to the carotids. An ECHOrevealed a preserved ejection fraction of 65% , no RWMA , nldiastolic function , normal RV size and function , nl LA and RA size ,and mild AS with a valve area of 1.4. The patient is notsymptomatic from his AS , by history. He denies syncope , chest pain ,orthopnea , PND , or LE edema.rhythm: NSRischemia:*CAD*Pt. reported no chest pain. His admission EKG showed new inferior/lateralST-T changes. Cardiac markers revealed CK 330 , CKMB 7.5 , and Tn I<assay.His EKG changes could represent old infarct ( although ECHO showed noRWMA ) or could represent demand ischemia in the setting ofhypertension and anemia. Pt. was treated with a bblocker , as above. Pt wasnot treated with ASA given his hematuria , but suchtherapy may be started on an outpatient basis. Pt. was not treated with anacei due to his creatinine , but such therapy , too , may be started on anoutpatient basis. Pt. may also benefit from outpt. stress testing. Lipidsprofile showed cholesterol 156 , triglycerides 119 , HDL 39 , LDL 93.GI: *reflux* Pt. was treated with nexium and mylanta PRN.He was maintained on a cardiac , diabetic diet.ENDO: *new DM , most likely type II* On admission pt. had a small aniongap , mild elevation of +B-hydroxybutyrate , and +ketones in his urine.With hydration , his gap closed. The ketoacidosis was likely fromstarvation. Pt's HGa1c was 10. ( He had not seen a physician in years ). Hewill be d/c'ed on glipizide 5. ( Metoformin was not started out of concernfor rising creatinine. He may benefit from the addition of a second oralagent as an oupatient ). Pt. will be given a glucometer and asked to checkhis blood sugar mornings.HEME: *anemia* Pt. had a normocytic anemia , likely related to hematuria ,gu+ stool.

Glyburide 1.25 mg daily.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room asdescribed above. He was stabilized in the PACU and transferredto the regular floor for a routine postoperative care. He wasgiven an epidural for pain control as well as IV Lopressor forperioperative beta blockade while the patient was n.p.o. He wasgiven supplemental oxygen and was weaned as tolerated. Thepatient was placed on the colectomy pathway postoperatively andhis NG tube was removed in the morning on postoperative day #1.He was advanced to sips with no nausea or vomiting. He had aBlake drain in his pelvis and that was left initially postopuntil the output decreased. His Foley and left ureteral stentwere in place for two days and then his JP drain was sent forcreatinine analysis to look for a ureteral leak. This was foundto be negative for leak and his JP drain was subsequentlyremoved. The patient was given subcutaneous heparin for DVTprophylaxis and he was given Ancef and Flagyl x2 two dosesperioperatively as well as his home HIV meds.The patient initially had an uneventful postoperative course andwas tolerating a house diet and had adequate ostomy output withno nausea or vomiting by postop day #3. However , bypostoperative #5 , the patient's abdomen was more distended and hehad increasing nausea with any type of food by mouth. A KUB wasobtained at that time which was consistent with ileus. Thepatient was switched back to clear liquids until his ostomy beganto function once again. He was given IV fluids for continuedhydration at that time. By postoperative day #7 , the patient'sileus had resolved and he was passing gas and stool into his bag.However , the output from his bag was greater than 1200 mL perday. The Metamucil was added as well as Imodium to decrease theoutput of his ostomy. By postop day #7 , in addition to his highostomy output , the patient had sinus tachycardia approximately110 beats per minute. His Lopressor was increased to 20 mg q.4h.for increased blood pressure control , and heart rate control. Bypostoperative day #8 , his heart rate was 80s to 90s and bloodpressure was 120s/70s. His ostomy continued to put out greaterthan 3 to 4 L over the course of next few days. During thistime , the patient was tolerating a regular diet with no nausea orvomiting , but his stools were increasingly liquid and highoutput. His fluid loss was supplemented with LR in a 1:1 fashionto of avoid dehydration. By postoperative day #11 , the patient'sostomy continued approximately 4 L and a tincture of opium wasbegun as a the third line agent to decrease the ostomy output.This decreased ostomy output to approximately 1 L and the patientsymptomatically was improving and feeling good. He wastolerating a regular diet with no nausea and no vomiting. Hispain was well controlled on p.o. pain meds , and the patientstated that he would be able to keep himself well hydrated ondischarge.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Acyclovir 400 mg p.o. daily.2. Truvada one tablet p.o. every other day.3. Nexium 20 mg daily.4. Lexiva 700 mg p.o. daily.5. Imodium 2 mg p.o. q.6h.6. Oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q.3h. p.r.n. pain.7. Metamucil two packets p.o. b.i.d.8.

The wound was then irrigated and closed in theOperating Room on March , 2001. However at his follow up visitto the clinic , his wound was erythematous and appeared to bequestionably infected. Thus , the wound was opened and debrided onthe day prior to the current admission. The patient reported ahistory of chills but no fever.Mr. Cord now presents preoperatively for an operative debridement.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Insulin-dependent diabetes.2.

In general , he was a thin appearing , middleaged Hispanic gentleman in no acute distress. His lungs wereclear. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a III/VIsystolic ejection murmur radiating to his neck. His abdomen wassoft , non-tender , non-distended. His extremities had no edema.His pulse examination showed palpable bilateral femoral pulses anddopplerable DP , PT and peroneal pulses bilaterally. On his leftgreat toe , there was an open wound with no purulent discharge andminimal erythema in the surrounding skin.ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 136 , potassium 4.9 , chloride 96 ,bicarbonate 36 , BUN 17 , creatinine 3.8 and a glucose of 469. CBC -9.4 , hematocrit 30.3 and platelet count of 460. INR of 1.2.Of note , his angiogram showed that his left common iliac artery haddiffuse disease. His external iliac artery on the left had a 40%proximal stenosis. His left SFA had proximal 50 to 60% stenosisand mid-50% stenosis. His popliteal had 50% disease and his tibialperoneal trunk on the left had moderate disease.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Vascular Serviceand started on Vancomycin , Levofloxacin and Flagyl. His wound waschanged b.i.d. and he was prepared for an operative debridement ofhis left great toe. His pulses continued to be dopplerable. Ofnote , the patient had very difficult to control diabetes , beingadmitted with sugars in the 400 to 500 range , requiring IV insulinboluses.On hospital day #3 , he was taken to the Operating Room for adebridement of his left great toe amputation and an amputation ofhis second toe with primary closure. This was done under ankleblock and was uncomplicated.The patient had a postoperative course significant for his verydifficult to control diabetes with intermittent hypoglycemia to the40s and hyperglycemia up to the 600s range. He did receive aconsult by the diabetes team who changed his regimen to 70-30insulin , 22 units q a.m. , 8 units of NPH insulin at 10:00 p.m. andfour units of regular insulin q p.m. , one-half hour before hissupper.

The wound was dressed with wet to dry dressing changesb.i.d. using normal saline and was directed specifically to not bepacked tightly but just to be wicked open.His antibiotics were changed to Augmentin and Levofloxacinimpirically , as the patient's cultures from the wound drainage fromnegative as of the time of discharge. He will also be continued onFlagyl for impiric coverage of C. diff , in case his C. diff toxinturns out positive. His antibiotics should continue for anothersix days post-discharge and this will complete a 2.5 week course ofantibiotics for him.The patient had no cardiac issues while in house. He washemodynamically stable.Of note , his sugars did trough on postoperative day #9 to a low of46 and he was reconsulted by the diabetes team with recommendationsto decrease his insulin; 70-30 in the morning to 18 units , insteadof 22 units. He will continue his NPH and regular insulin coverageas previously recommended.On discharge , the patient is afebrile with stable vital signs. Hislungs are clear. Heart is regular rate and rhythm.

History of left upper extremity thrombophlebitis.10. Microcytic anemia.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:The patient is a 75-year-old woman who was found at home withaltered mental status by home services and home nursing withconfusion. Her fingerstick was 37 , which increased to 42 withorange juice with improvement of her mental status. Her insulinregimen has been stable for quite some time. She had taken herregular dose of Novolin 40 units on the morning of admission.She was sent to the emergency department. She has notedincreasing bilateral lower extremity edema over one or twomonths , increased dyspnea on exertion , nocturia. In the ED , herambulatory sat was 91% on room air. Glucose was still low and onchest x-ray there was evidence of a right pleural effusion andright lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis. She was givenLasix , glucose , Levaquin , and blood cultures were drawn. She wasadmitted for treatment of pneumonia.She has an allergy to propoxyphene.MEDICATIONS:1. Lasix 80 mg p.o q.d. in the morning , 40 mg p.o. q.d. in theevening.2. Atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.d.3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.4. Amitriptyline 25 to 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.5. Multivitamins.6.

Epogen 5000 units subcu. q. week.FAMILY HISTORY:Father died of an MI in his 70s , mother died of leukemia. Nohistory of hematologic disorders in her family. No history ofthalassemia that the patient knows of.SOCIAL HISTORY:She lives in an assisted living facility and has extensive homecare services and lives alone. She was previously a nurse. Shehas children who live nearby.PHYSICAL EXAM:Vital signs: Temperature was 95.2 , blood pressure 111/69 , heartrate 73 , sating 97% on room air. She was alert and oriented x3.Speech and mentation were normal. No lymphadenopathy. 2/6systolic murmur at the base radiating to across her precordium.Distant heart sounds. Right lower lobe with decreased breathsounds and decreased phrenitis , wheezing throughout her rightlung. Abdomen: Obese , soft , nondistended , nontender , benign.Extremities: 2 to 3+ pitting edema bilateral and symmetric.Neurologic: She was moving all extremities well. Left eye withslight lateral deviation. Extraocular movements intact. Pupilsequally round and reactive to light. Evidence of an oldcataract.ADMISSION DATA:BNP of 1111 , creatinine was 2.4 which was below her baseline of2.6 to 2.8 , white count was 6.6 with no left shift , hematocritwas 35.7 which is up from her baseline of 27 to 33. MCV was 67.4which is stable and it has been in this range and she was foundto have in 5/25 a monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP. EKG showedan inferoseptal Q wave , poor R wave progression , low voltage leftaxis deviation. Echo in 5/25 showed an EF of 50 to 55% withmoderate-to-severe MR and TR , septal hypokinesis and a MIBI atthat time showed no reversible ischemia. Chest x-ray asdescribes above. UA negative for UTI.IMPRESSION:The patient was evaluated to be low likelihood for havingpneumonia. She was thought to more likely have volume overloadsecondary to CHF. Because of her visual problems and decliningphysical condition and deconditioning , patient's current livingsituation and arrangements are possibly insufficient for herincreasing needs and error in self administration of medicationsor increasing renal insufficiency or poor p.o. intake may haveprecipitated her hypoglycemic episode and altered mental status.HOSPITAL COURSE:ID/Pulmonary: Right lower lobe pneumonia versus CHF , pleuraleffusion. This was treated initially with levofloxacin althoughit is unlikely consolidated lobar pneumonia because of thepatient's good clinical status , lack of fever and white count andlack of toxicity. Sputum culture and gram stein wereunremarkable. Pleural effusion on the right decreased onlyminimally with diuresis of 1 to 2 liters overnight and fordiagnostic and therapeutic purposes , the patient underwent athoracentesis on 3/1/05 and had withdraw 800 cc of clear yellowfluid whose chemistries and cell count were consistent with asterile transudative effusion. Gram stein was negative.Cultures are pending at this time and a chest x-ray may berepeated to rule out underlying pneumonia revealed by draining ofthe effusion. Urine legionella was negative.Renal: Chronic renal insufficiency. Creatinine is at a baselineof 2.6 and it decreased significantly on this admission possiblybecause of improved forward flow from discontinuation of her ACEinhibitor.Endocrinology: The patient was admitted with hypoglycemicdiabetes possibly secondary to infection or logistical and socialbarriers. Her NPH dose was cut to 20 units subcu. q.d. withlispro sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s. which she needed onlyminimally about 5 units a day and her sugars were well controlledon this regimen which supports the hypothesis that her NPH doseof 34 units a day was too high beyond a certain point.Cardiac:A. Pump: The patient with CHF , known valvular dysfunction ,exhibiting pulmonary edema , lower extremity edema and orthopnea.She was initially diuresed with IV Lasix and it was noted thather weight was up 10 pounds from her prior admission. She wastransitioned to p.o. Lasix after diuresing very well on thisregimen. She continued her Lipitor and aspirin , atenolol waschanged metoprolol given her renal insufficiency. Lisinopril wasswitched to captopril , then discontinued given her bumpingcreatinine while diuresing on the ACE inhibitor. She wasslightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 90s to100s at one point and responded to a bolus of fluid , decrease inthe captopril and holding the Lasix , unclear etiology , looksotherwise low. Lasix was decreased to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and thepatient should have daily weights and electrolytes checked andrepleted to ensure that her diuresis is only moderate everyday nomore than one liter a day but is consistent such that she is ableto maintain her electrolytes and loose fluid overtime.Heme: The patient has a monoclonal gammopathy and a microcytosiswhich might suggest thalassemia. She is on iron and Epogen withan improved hematocrit from the prior admission but no change inher MCV , which suggests that she has more than renal diseasecausing her microcytosis. Further workup of her monoclonalgammopathy will be deferred to her primary care physician.Diabetic diet: Low sodium , low fat , low cholesterol.Prophylaxis: Heparin and H2 blocker.DISPOSITION:The patient has been screened for admission to Jack Nor Medical Center Of whereshe will go today. Her goal is intense physical therapy andlearning greater independence in her daily functioning. Herpelvic films were negative for fracture. She should be ambulatedt.i.d.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.

Ellington is her primary carephysician , Jarrett Sandlan her PCP number is 653-609-3621. Sheshould b switched to Toprol as her blood pressure tolerates andto lisinopril as her creatinine tolerates after low-leveldiuresis of about 50 cc to one liter a day. Studies pendinginclude cytology and culture of pleural fluid and follow-up chestx-ray on the day of her discharge. Lasix dose can be increased asneeded for better diuresis.eScription document: 8-8470788 EMSSten TelDictated By: KUFFEL , CARLOSAttending: KRESHA , OTISDictation ID 0475358D: 4/5/05T: 4/5/05

Previously , the patient was admitted to Sourceshcate Naj. Hospitalfor vertigo that was consistent with a right pontine lacunarinfarct , but despite being on Plavix and aspirin that was in10/18 .  Her hospital course was complicated by an MI , and thepatient was medically managed. The patient was again admitted tothe Crny'ssha Medical Center on 5/18/05 for hypotension and unresponsivenessafter dialysis. She had negative CT at that point. Since thatadmission , she had been doing well until 10/26/05 when she hadnausea vomiting and diaphoresis following hemodialysis. She wasadmitted to rule out cardiac cause versus infection. Herhospital course was complicated by continued hypotension anddecreased temperature. In the emergency department , onpresentation , the patient had a temperature of 95.8 , heart rateof 102. Her blood pressure was 83 to 122 over 40s to 60s. Herrespiratory rate was 16. She was sating 95% on room air. Shegot 500 mg of levofloxacin and her Lopressor was held due tohypotension , and she was admitted with concern for infectiousprocess. She was initially admitted to the floor where she wasfound to be afebrile with the rate of 92 , respirations of 20 , andblood pressure was 100/57. Her exam revealed bibasilar rales ,left greater than the right. Her abdominal exam revealednontender and nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.Her extremities revealed warm. She had bilateral below the kneeamputations. Her cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate andrhythm with the 2/6 systolic murmur.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Significant for chronic renal insufficiency , end-stage renaldisease on hemodialysis , insulin-dependent diabetes , CVA ,bilateral below the knee amputations , CAD , status post MI in10/18 , hypertension , and peripheral vascular disease.MEDICATIONS:Folate 1 mg daily , aspirin 81 mg daily , NPH , Isordil , lisinopril ,Plavix 75 mg , Paxil 10 mg , Pravachol 20 mg , Neurontin , Protonix40 mg , vitamin B12 100 mcg , and Nephrocaps.SOCIAL HISTORY:She lives with her grandchildren. She does not smoke or drink.FAMILY HISTORY:Significant for sister with coronary artery disease.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Neurologic exam: She is alert and oriented x3.LABORATORY DATA:Significant for CK of 39 , MB of 2.3 , and troponin of 0.36. Herwhite count was 8. Her hematocrit was 36.2 , and her plateletswere 298 , 000. Her INR was 1.3. Her EKG revealed a regular rateand rhythm. Normal axis. T-wave inversions and flattenings inthe lateral leads on low voltage in the limb leads. Her chestx-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation and left effusion.IMPRESSION:An 86-year-old female with end-stage renal disease onhemodialysis , presenting with episodes of nausea , vomiting , anddiaphoresis of unclear etiology.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:Cardiovascular: Upon admission , the patient had a slighttroponin leak. It was unclear for initial presenting symptoms orsubsequent secondary to ischemia. On her second hospital day ,she developed hypotension. Initially , her systolic bloodpressure dropped to the 80s and her blood pressure medicines wereheld. Subsequently , her blood pressure dropped into the 70s andshe required dopamine and was transferred to the Cardiac CareUnit. In the Cardiac Care Unit , she was started on the dopaminedrip of 10 mcg/kg/minute. In the Cardiac Care Unit , the initialdifferential diagnoses were hypertension was cardiogenic versusseptic physiology. However , her white count revealed significantelevation of 24.6 with bandemia , 10% bands. She also had anelevated lactate of 9.3 concerning for GI etiology. Possibly gutischemia was the cause of her infection. She was covered broadlywith amp , vanc , levo , and Flagyl. She subsequently required theaddition of Neo-Synephrine as a second pressor agent to maintainher blood pressure. Dopamine was weaned off. However , on thesecond day in the CCU , on 9/26/05 , the patient developed suddenhypotension. Physicians were called to see the patient and atthat time she was found to have no palpable pulse. Code wasinitiated. The patient was found to be in pulseless electricalactivity. Chest compressions were initiated , and she was maskventilated , and she received multiple rounds of epinephrine andatropine. She received 2 amps of bicarbonate and 1 amp ofcalcium gluconate given concern for hyperkalemia in the settingof end-stage renal disease. Anesthesia then arrived and thepatient was intubated. Despite all efforts , the patient's rhythmdeteriorated to asystole , and she was pronounced dead at 5:30p.m. on 9/26/05 , which was the time of death.eScription document: 5-7818569 EMSFocus transcriptionistsDictated By: HOKUTAN , ALEXANDERAttending: BRONDER , SANGDictation ID 7809913D: 4/3/05T: 4/3/05

Cardiac risk factorsinclude positive for hypertension and diabetes , family history , andelevated cholesterol. Negative for tobacco and negative forprevious myocardial infarction. The patient initially presented inSeptember of l988 with chest pain. She had an exercise tolerancetest at that time where she went nine minutes with non-diagnosticchanges. In April of l988 , she had an exercise tolerance testwith thallium. She went 7 minutes and 33 seconds stopping becauseof shortness of breath with non-diagnostic changes and demonstratedreperfusion defects. She was treated at that time with Diltiazemand Enalapril. Patient did well until February of l990 when shewas admitted to the Uscven Medical Center with unstableangina and electrocardiogram changes. An exercise tolerance testat that time demonstrated six minute and twenty second durationwith blood pressure response of l46/86 and global greater than 2 mmST depressions. The patient went to Catheterization where she hadnormal filling pressures. She was noted to have a 30% leftanterior descending lesion , a 90% Dl lesion , and a 40% OMBl lesion.At that time , her ejection fraction was 43% and she was noted tohave inferior hypokinesis. Patient was treated at that time with aPTCA. Her Dl was reduced from 90% to 20% without complications.Patient has done well since that time until about five days priorto admission when she noted increasing exertional angina whilewalking up stairs that was relieved easily with one Nitroglycerin.This continued to progress , always symptoms occurring with exertionwith several episodes of pain on the day of admission notassociated with shortness of breath , diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting ,or radiation. Patient said that her longest episode of pain wasapproximately twenty minutes. This was because she did not haveher Nitroglycerin with her and was unable to take any medication.Patient denies any history of rest pain. In addition , the patienthad some suggestion of difficulty sleeping at night requiring morepillows. However , she denies that this is related to herbreathing. Patient has no history of medical non-compliance anddenies any constitutive symptoms such as fevers , chills , sweats ,rash , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , or change in bowel habits.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Hypertension. 2 ) Diabetes , adultonset. 3 ) Elevated cholesterol. 4 ) Carpal-tunnel syndrome. 5 )Status post total abdominal hysterectomy. 6 ) Colonic polys. 7 )Gravida XIV , para 9 , AB 5. 8 ) Thyroid tumor resection.

ALLERGIES: The patient denies any known drugallergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband whois very supportive and has a close relationship to all of her ninechildren.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a pleasantobese white woman in no apparent distress.Her temperature was 98.6 , blood pressure l52/84 , pulse 70 , andrespirations l6. SKIN: Without lesions. HEENT: Clear oropharynxwithout any lymphadenopathy. Pupils equal and reactive to light.NECK: Demonstrated a well healed thyroid scar , supple withoutmasses. CHEST: Clear. There was a question of some crackles atthe bases. CARDIOVASCULAR: There was no evident jugular venousdistention , carotids were l+ bilaterally , and Sl/S2 withoutmurmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN: Obese , soft , and non-tenderwith normal bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Without edema. PULSES:Dorsalis pedis 2+ bilaterally and posterior tibial of l+bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Non-focal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , electrolytes were withinnormal limits. Hematocrit was 40 , whiteblood cell count was l3.0 , and platelets were 28l , 000. Chest X-Raywas within normal limits. ECG demonstrated a sinus rhythm at 90beats per minute with an axis of 0 , intervals of 0.l6/0.06/0.32 ,and there were some T wave inversions in I and L with l mm STdepression that was upsloping in V4 through V6 without significantchange from March , l980.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to a monitored bed and wasruled out for myocardial infarction with serialCK enzymes of l76 , l33 , and ll5. There were no evident changes inher serial EKG. Of note , however , her second EKG had leadreversal. Patient did well after admission with no evident chestpain. There was some concern on admission with the story ofdifficulty sleeping at night raising the possibility of somecongestive heart failure. However , throughout the admission , thepatient showed no symptoms of this. Indeed , she slept wellthroughout the nights without any difficulty breathing and therewas no evidence of congestive heart failure on her chest X-Ray. Thepatient went for cardiac catheterization which demonstrated thatshe had , in fact , reoccluded her Dl vessel to 95% stenosis and ofnote , she also had her OMBl with a 50% lesion. However , it wasnoted on catheterization that there was a small dissection proximalon the Dl vessel providing a relative contraindication to reattemptat PTCA. Therefore , this procedure was not attempted. It was feltthat the best approach for this patient would be to improve hermedical management at the present time and then at some future dateif necessary , to bring the patient back to catheterization with thehope that an attempt at PTCA could be made later. The patient'sLopressor was increased to 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. and her Isordil wasincreased to 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. The patient underwent exercisetolerance test using the standard Bruce protocol and she went forsix minutes and four seconds stopping because of shortness ofbreath denying any chest pain. However , she did have l.5 mm flatST depressions in leads II , III , and F and the lateral leads aswell as a l/2 mm ST elevation in aVL.DISPOSITION: Patient was sent home on her current medicalmanagement with the understanding that she shouldreport any changes in her symptomatology as well as should maintainclose follow-up with Dr. Maher . She will carry with her , atall times , Nitroglycerin. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Ecotrin onetablet p.o. q.d. 2 ) Insulin 60 units of NPH and 20 units ofRegular q.a.m. and 20 units of NPH and 6 units of Regular q.p.m. 3 )Lovastatin 20 mg p.o. q.p.m. 4 ) Lopressor 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5 )Isordil 30 mg p.o. t.i.d.

His cardiac risk factors include a history of cigarettesmoking , hypertension , family history , questionable history ofhypercholesterolemia and no history of diabetes. The patient isfollowed by Dr. Zirker for hypertension. Approximately one yearago , he was sitting on a bike awaiting an exercise test and he feltlightheaded without any chest pain. He was admitted to ACH forquestion of rule out myocardial infarction. He had an exercisetolerance test one day later without chest pain or shortness ofbreath. He exercises daily as well as jogging. Two weeks prior toadmission , the patient walked one block , he had acute shortness ofbreath while awaiting for a train. He had a head cold withcongestion and cough at that time. He had no chest pain but didhave diaphoresis and mild nausea and vomiting as well aslightheadedness and some palpitations lasting approximately onehour in duration. On the day of admission after taking a shower inthe morning , he had increasing shortness of breath gradually atrest with epigastric tightness without radiation but he did havenausea , vomiting and diaphoresis. He was seen at Higheun Medical Center because he was "unable to breathe". In theemergency room he had a blood pressure of 207/150 with saturationof 93% , rales and positive S4. He was treated with nitroglycerin ,morphine , Lasix and Nitropaste. He was also given Lopressor , 15mg. EKG showed Q's in V1-2 , 1-2 mm ST increasing in V1 , lateral Twave inversions. Blood pressure dropped to 99/67 with treatmentand he was sent for emergent cardiac catheterization.HOSPITAL COURSE: EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 91 , -15degrees axis. There were left atrialabnormalities. There was ST elevation of 1-2 mm in V1-3 , T waveinversion in I , L , V4-6; Q's in V1 and V2. This was new comparedwith prior EKG. The patient underwent cardiac catheterizationwhich revealed pulmonary capillary wedge of 30 , RV 46/14 , PA 46/30 ,ramus occluded 50%. The patient developed left arm pain withinflation and slow flow after PTCA. The patient had decreasedblood pressure and heart rate and was treated with Narcan andatropine. The patient was treated with nitroglycerin , heparin andaspirin. He was also started on Lopressor. He was given IV Lasixfor diuresis and magnesium. The patient's third set CPK came backat 429 with 10 MB's. The patient was stable overnight. Hiselectrophoresis came back negative. It was felt that an acutemyocardial infarction was less likely and it was felt thatpulmonary edema was secondary to his hypertensive disease being outof control. His heparin was discontinued and he was switched toatenolol and lisinopril. The patient underwent exercise tolerancetest where he completed a submaximal predischarge protocol withoutpain or dyspnea. His resting EKG showed evidence of anteriorseptal myocardial infarction with a peak heart rate of 120 , bloodpressure 180/90. There were some mild fixed defects anteriorly.He also developed some dysuria after removal of the Foley with100 , 000 enteric gram negative rods.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stablecondition.

The patient , previous to his recent onset ofchest pain , had been very active with thirty to forty minutes ofexertion daily without chest discomfort. For the past five daysprior to admission , he noted progressive acceleration in his chestpain symptoms which were occurring with minimal exertion. Thepatient's local physician performed an exercise stress test and thepatient developed symptoms at seven minutes of walking withassociated ECG changes. Several hours after the stress test , hehad recurrent chest pain at home and took a total of twelvesublingual TNG without relief. He presented to the Ings Hospital Emergency Room. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Medicationsat home including Tenormin , Allopurinol , and Coated Aspirin.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. Cardiac risk factors werenegative for hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco , anddiabetes.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the CardiologyService where he appeared to rule in formyocardial infarction. He was admitted to Dr. Vessservice and underwent cardiac catheterization on 2/25/93 .  Thisrevealed a 50% distal left main lesion , 100% mid left anteriordescending lesion , 70% mid left circumflex lesion , 70% D1 lesion ,and 100% right coronary artery lesion. In the CardiacCatheterization Laboratory , the patient had an intraaortic balloonpump secondary to ongoing chest pain and was referred to Dr. Bersawfor coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient was taken to theOperating Room for coronary artery bypass grafting on 5/12/93 .  Atthat time , he underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypassgrafting times four with grafts including vein grafts to the leftanterior descending , the D1 , OM1 , and proximal descending artery.Patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively , wasnoted to be somewhat hypoxic. His post-operative chest film themorning of post-operative day number one was notable foropacification of the left hemithorax. The patient was taken backto the Operating Room for evacuation of blood from the left chestand at that time , small bleeding site was found from a sternal wireon the left side. The patient returned to the Intensive Care Unitand did well post-operatively being extubated post-operative daynumber one. His initial post-operative course was notable foratrial fibrillation with rates in the 100 range as well as someintermittent hypotension. The patient was transferred back to theIes Hospital on Maryland for further management. On the day ofhis transfer , however , while being treated for rapid atrialfibrillation , he experienced a torsade arrest and a Code Blue wascalled. The patient was blindly intubated and from this event , wasfelt to have experienced an aspiration pneumonia. Patient wassuccessfully resuscitated and was extubated several days later atwhich point he was transferred back to the Cardiac SurgicalService. From that time on , he had a stable post-operative coursewith intermittent slow atrial fibrillation which was well toleratedby the patient. He continued to progress well and considerationwas made for need for transfer to a rehabilitation facility but thepatient made good progress with his cardiopulmonary rehabilitationby the Physical Therapy Service and was safe for discharge to homeon post-operative day number thirteen.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. ,Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Tylenol #3 as neededfor pain , Atrovent two puffs q.i.d. as needed , and Enteric CoatedAspirin one per day.

One weekprior to admission , she had had upper respiratory infectionsymptoms and with some sick contacts. One day prior toadmission , the patient began with increased shortness of breathover a 3 to 4-hour period while lying down. She came to theemergency room where she was found to be wheezing. She did nothave any chest pressure or pain , but she did have some shortnessof breath and a cough productive of white sputum. She had nowheezing , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and no change in her eatinghabits. No missed medications. She denied any PND , DOE ororthopnea , and she had not noticed increased leg edema. In theemergency department , she was given Atrovent , prednisone , Lasix ,albuterol nebulizers and Solu-Medrol as it was unknown at thetime whether or not this was a CHF exacerbation or a COPDexacerbation.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile at 97.5 with a pulse of71 , blood pressure of 111/63 , and respiratory rate of 18 ,saturating 98% on 2 liters. Physical examination was moresignificant for a DVD at 10 cm. Heart exam was significant forgallops being absent. No S3 or S4. Respiratory exam wassignificant for some wheezes , but no rales however.ADMISSION LABORATORY: A Chem 7 was significant for hyponitremiaat 132 and a hyperkalemia at 5.4. Her digoxin level wastherapeutic at 1.8. Total bilirubin was 1.8. A BNP was mildlyelevated at 189. First set of enzymes were cardiac enzymes torule out MI were negative.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: The patient's admission medications weredigoxin 0.25 mg daily , Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d. , Lipitor 80 mg daily ,Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d. , spironolactone 12.5 mg daily , aspirin 81 mgdaily , nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and Lasix.ALLERGIES: Included Captopril , which gave her a cough.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lived with family. Denied any drinking andsmoking , but however did have significant second hand smokeinhalation history by her husband having been a heavy smokerduring their many years of marriage.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease inwhich she had an acute myocardial infarction in 1995 for which astent was placed in the LAD. She then had an instant V stenosisand had then a two-vessel CABG , which was the SVG to the LAD , andthe SVG to the RCA. In 1997 , she had a SVG , LAD stent tostenosis to then to VStent. In 1988 she had a third SVG LADstent placed and an ICD was placed for a low VF and presumablyarrhythmias. The cardiac risk factors include hypertension ,hyperlipidemia , and smoke inhalation history.She was admitted for shortness of breath , presumes likelysecondary to a CHF or reactive airway disease precipitated by anupper respiratory tract infection.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient was cycled throughthree sets of enzymes , which were all negative. The patient didnot have chest pressure or pain at any moment of herhospitalization and did not need any nitroglycerin. There wereno EKG changes. She was continued on her statin , beta blocker ,and ACE inhibitor , and aspirin. Cardiovascular pump. Thepatient oscillated between the mildly fluid overloaded toeuvolemic. She was maintained on Lasix , and did well that way.The patient received an echo on May , 2004 , which showednormal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness withoverall systolic function being moderately in pair with ejectionfraction of 35%. There was severe hypokinesis and akinesisinvolving the mid distal septum apex and distal inferior andlateral walls , and there was also abnormal septal motionconsistent with intraventricular conduction delay. An ICP wasseen to be in place and the aortic valve was mildly calcified.The left atrium was mildly enlarged. There was also moderatetricuspid regurgitation with velocity of 2.9 m/second detectingpulmonary artery systolic pressures of 33mmHg. It was determinedthat since 7/26 there had been no significant interval change.Rhythm: The patient was in normal sinus rhythm with an ICDplaced. There were no issues.2. Pulmonary: Initially when the patient was admitted with hersignificant coronary history , she was being treated like a CHFexacerbation. However , despite her being relatively refractorytreatment it was decided to increase the treatments for apossible COPD exacerbation. In this way , she was receivingDuonebs and albuterol nebulizers 2-2 hours alternating and it wasdecided to change her from p.o. prednisone to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m.In addition , Tessalon Perles and guaifenesin was added. Finally ,azithromycin was added so as to possibly treat any atypicalpneumonia as the patient had only some interstitial pattern onher chest x-ray , and did not have any focal area ofconsolidation.3. Endocrine: When the patient was admitted , she was maintainedon her home dose regimen for diabetes mellitus. However , whenbeing admitted she was given p.o. prednisone for COPDexacerbation , and therefore , had uncontrolled blood sugars.Because a finger stick blood glucose and insulin sliding scaledid not fully control her blood glucose. She at one point beganto have an non-gap metabolic acidosis. Anticipating possibledecay , she was started on regular lab draws and insulin drips.Her gap promptly closed and the patient was , otherwise ,asymptomatic. She did not have any potassium , fluid or othercomplications. Throughout she was also receiving NPH insulin inthe a.m. and p.m.The patient was discharged to follow with her primary carephysician , and the patient received at home VNA services.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications included1. NPH insulin10 units in the a.m. and 4 units in the p.m.2. Flovent , Tessalon Perles and guaifenesin.3. Zocor 40 mg daily.4. Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d.5. Digoxin 0.125 daily.6. Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d.7.

The night prior toadmission , she had been readmitted to Nordi Medical Center where shewas found to have a worsening CHF exacerbation with symptomaticbradycardia with heart rate in the 20s. The patient receiveddiuresis , had a chest MRA to rule out pulmonary embolism , whichwas negative and was transferred to Redd Hospitalfor telemetry. The bradycardia was thought to have been from arecent increase in the patient's Toprol XL dose. On admission ,the patient was afebrile. Temperature 96.5 , pulse in the 70s and80s , pressure 140/80 , breathing a 100% on four liters. Examsignificant for an awake , alert , pleasant older women , very hardof hearing , decreased breath sounds with rhonchi right greaterthan left and decreased breath sounds in the right middle lobe ,poor inspiratory effort. Exam also significant for a hardsystolic ejection murmur , crescendo decrescendo heard best at theright upper sternal border radiating to the carotids , alsoaudible at the apex. Her JVP was at 12 cm. She had no lowerextremity edema. Her labs were significant for a creatinine of2.7 , a slightly elevated dedimer at Hen Mekend Medical Center , a chest x-ray thatshowed a right middle lobe pneumonia that was resolving ,cardiomegaly.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular: There was no evidence of acute ischemia. Shehad a small elevation of her troponins in the morning afteradmission thought secondary perhaps to CHF exacerbation orchronic renal insufficiency. She was restarted on a very lowdose of Lopressor keeping atropine at her bedside in case ofsymptomatic bradycardia. She did have a heart rate occasionallyin the 40s during this hospitalization , but was asymptomaticthroughout. In terms of her rhythm , in addition to theasymptomatic bradycardia , she did have several runs ofnon-sustained ventricular tachycardia. These diminished withrepletion of magnesium and again were asymptomatic. Theelectrophysiology was consulted and they did not feel that anyintervention was indicated given the asymptomatic nature of herarrhythmias. In terms of her congestive heart failureexacerbation was thought to be the primary reason for hertachypnea and dyspnea. She was diuresed gently given her aorticstenosis and tolerated well a net fluid loss of 500 to a 1000 ccper day with great increase in her comfort breathing. Notablyshe never had an increased oxygen requirement even whentachypneic. We will do a dry weight before her discharge andsend her out on a dose of Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. with a dryweight to be followed at the skilled nursing facility. She willalso have a follow up appointment with Dr. Erin Bahadue atOer Healthcare .2. Infectious disease: On chest x-ray , the patient has apersistent right middle lobe process an on the second day of herhospitalization had increasing tachypnea , was found to be fluidoverloaded and was gently diuresed as mentioned earlier. Becausea recurrence of her pneumonia cannot be ruled out , we willcomplete a 14-day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl , which wasadded for the concern of aspiration to add anaerobic coverage.3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency. Thepatient's creatinine has improved during her hospitalization andis currently 2.0. We have replaced her magnesium and put her ona small dose of daily K-Dur 10 mEq per day to compensate for herLasix diuresis.4. Neuro: The patient was seen by the speech and swallowservice. Their recommendations were mechanical , soft , solid dietwith thin liquids , out of bed at all meals.The patient will be discharged on Flagyl to finish a 14-daycourse , levofloxacin to finish a 14-day course. The patient'slevofloxacin should be taken until 1/29/03 and the patient'sFlagyl should be taken until 8/30/03 .  The patient will also bedischarged on the salicylic acid 81 mg , Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. ,Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin was given for prophylaxis as aninpatient , but she should be treated according to MVCMC policies ,lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,multivitamin , simvastatin 20 mg q.h.s. , K-Dur 10 mEq x1 p.o.q.d. , and Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d.She will be discharged to the EH in good condition.Thank you for the opportunity to care for this lovely patient.eScription document: 8-2244235 EMSSten TelDictated By: FRATZKE , KORYAttending: KARAGIANNIS , VALENTINE ROOSEVELTDictation ID 8031463D: 9/9/03T: 9/9/03

He has a history of insulindependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia ,and former tobacco use. He had multiple exercise tolerance testsin 1993 which were highly predictive of ischemia with significantEKG changes and symptoms in the recovery phase. He was put onmaximal medications , and his most recent exercise tolerance test in4/06 was not as positive as previously , but still suggestive ofischemia. The patient relates increasing exertional chest pain forseveral months , and increasing antianginal medications required.He had witnessed syncope at work , 911 was called , and he was foundto be in VF and defibrillated into asystole , which then convertedto atrial fibrillation. He did not require intubation. He wastaken to Wtazealt Imedet Medical Hospital , admitted , and ruled in for amyocardial infarction. Despite some short term memory loss relatedto the incident , he does recall having chest pain just prior tosyncope. On the night before transfer , he was resting comfortably ,sitting at the side of the bed for the first time when he went intoVF on the monitor and loss consciousness. He was immediatelycardioverted to sinus rhythm and begun on lidocaine. He hadanother episode of VT two hours later which deteriorated into VF ,again requiring cardioversion sinus bradycardia. Lidocaine wasincreased to 3 mg per hour and arrangements were made to transferto the Aand An Hospital .  On arrival , he denied chestpain.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus , hypertension ,hypercholesterolemia , orthopedic problems including severe shoulderdislocations as a child with chronic shoulder osteoarthritis and arecent meniscal tear of the knee.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Subcu insulin 70/30 50 q.a.m. , NPH 50 mgq.p.m. , Corgard , Procardia XL , Mevacor ,enteric coated aspirin , and TNG p.r.n.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiologyservice initially. He was seen incatheterization and found to have a complex LAD stenosis that was60% in the mid and 70% in the distal LAD , 40% proximal leftcircumflex , 70% complex stenosis in the OM2 , and an occluded RCA.His LV gram showed an ejection fraction of 40%-50% withanteroapical akinesis. He had no further chest pain or ectopy onthe TNG , lidocaine , and beta blockers , and he was successfullydiuresed. Given these findings , he was taken to the Operating Roomon 1/26/96 , at which time he had a coronary artery bypass graftwith a LIMA to the LAD , and a saphenous vein graft to the OM1 andto the PDA. He came off bypass and required atrial pacing andrenal dopamine. However , postoperatively , on transfer to theIntensive Care Unit , he did not require any further pacing.Dopamine was weaned successfully to renal dose and then to off.The patient extubated without difficulty by postoperative day oneand he was started on Lopressor and enteric coated aspirin. He hada high insulin requirement which , over the course of his stay , ranup to over 100 units total per day. He was transferred to thefloor by postoperative day one. Because of his obesity , herequired a big boy bed and he was seen by physical therapy toimprove his mobilization. He was successfully weaned off oxygenand was ambulating by the time of discharge without any trouble.Because of his history of VF/VT , he was planned for EP studies andthese were negative. The patient's stay , however , was prolonged byevidence of cellulitis , particularly of his right saphenous veingraft site. There was no breakdown or discharge , however , therewas erythema and warmth , which was treated with IV antibiotics( ultimately Ancef IV ) and elevation. The patient's white countremained stable. He was never febrile. The redness was ultimatelydecreased by the time of discharge , and he was sent home on p.o.Keflex.DISPOSITION: To home with services.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler two puffs four times aday , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.day , NPH 65 units q.a.m. and 45 units q.p.m. subcu , Mevacor 20 mgtwice a day , Lopressor 25 mg three times a day , Niferex 150 b.i.d. ,Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h. p.r.n. , Colace 100 mg p.o.t.i.d. while on Percocet , and Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d.FOLLOW-UP: The patient will have follow up with Dr. Rich N Mengsteab , primary medical doctor , for wound monitoringand management of his sugars.

Of note she had beennoncompliant with prior regimens and treatments and despitediuretics started three days by her primary care physician shereported new shortness of breath and chest pain at rest. An EKGin the emergency department revealed widespread ST depressions.She was treated for pulmonary edema with IV nitroglycerin , Lasix ,aspirin , heparin , beta-blockers , and then she was taken urgentlyto the cath lab where coronary angiography revealed a left maincoronary artery thrombosis with proximal and distal stenoses ofabout 70% , 50% of her LAD , and 60% of her first diagonal. Thepatient was transferred to the coronary care unit after placementof an intraaortic balloon pump for further management andevaluation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:CHF , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , CAD , prior myocardialinfarction , restrictive lung disease , diabetes mellitus , chronicrenal insufficiency , morbid obesity , and iron deficiency anemia.HOME MEDICATIONS:Aspirin , hydralazine , nitroglycerin , quinine , Norvasc , Lasix ,Toprol , lisinopril , albuterol , and famotidine.ALLERGIES:She was allergic to erythromycin , Bactrim , and IV contrast.FAMILY HISTORY:Noncontributory.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:Noted no fever , chills , sweats , coughs , abdominal pain , nausea ,or vomiting.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:She was morbidly obese with moderate respiratory distress lyingat about 30-degree angle. Her O2 saturation was 97% on 3L nasalcannula. Temperature was 99 degrees , pulse was 80 and regular ,BP was 140/50 , and respirations about 20. Mucous membranes weremoist and intact. Pupils were equal , round , and reactive tolight. Her sclerae were anicteric. Her conjunctivae were pale.She had a 15-cm of JVD with 2+ carotids without bruits. Coarsebreath sounds bilaterally with crackles two-thirds of the way upthe bases. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm with 2/6holosystolic murmur. Her abdomen was obese , soft , nontender , andnondistended. She had no clubbing , cyanosis , or palpable edema.She has 1+ distal pulses noted.Her EKG was normal sinus rhythm with ST depressions in theinferolateral leads and a right bundle-branch block was present.Her chest x-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltratesconsistent with edema. So the patient was admitted to thecoronary care unit and a consult with Cardiovascular Surgery andserial crits were performed. The patient's condition continuedto deteriorate. She developed respiratory distress. Anesthesiawas called and her airway was secured via an emergent intubation.The patient subsequently developed signs of abdominal pain andpresumed sepsis and ischemic bowel. She was brought to theoperating room for an exploratory laparotomy. Status post anexploratory laparotomy the patient had a complex course in thesurgical ICU where she underwent multi-organ system dysfunction.Her prognosis was very dire. This was explained to the familyand on 7/12/05 at 2:20 a.m. the family decided to withdraw care ,which will be consistent with both the patient and family'swishes and desires , and the patient was pronounced dead at 2:24a.m. on 7/12/05 .DATE OF DEATH:7/12/05TIME OF DEATH:02:24 a.m.eScription document: 4-3201737 EMSSten TelDictated By: GARZONE , COREYAttending: AIKENS , GIUSEPPEDictation ID 5999531D: 11/4/06T: 11/4/06

Infectious Disease: In the emergency department , thepatient's left elbow was tapped by the orthopedic service. Thefluid was sent for Gram stain and culture , and showed 92 , 000white blood cells with 95% polys , and no crystals. Gram stainand culture remained negative throughout the patient's hospitalstay. The infectious disease service was consulted as well asthe patient's outpatient rheumatologist. Given the patient'sclinical history and the high white cell count found in the jointfluid , it was decided that he would be started on cefotaxime andvancomycin. On 4/22/2003 , despite cultures still beingnegative , it was decided to manage the patient conservatively ,and he was taken to the operating room , where the joint wasirrigated , and the fluid was sent as well as a biopsy of thejoint tissue. Pathology severe mixed acute and chronic synovitiswith foreign body giant cell reaction. The cultures sent fromthe operating room remained negative until the time of discharge.A nasal swab looking for MRSA was sent and came back negative.Based on these findings , it was decided that vancomycin will notbe necessary as an outpatient , and the patient was discharged onIV ceftriaxone q.24h. for 4 weeks. By the time of discharge , hehad been afebrile for greater than 48 hours.2. Rheumatology: Enbrel , which is a potent immunosuppressant ,was held during this admission because of a suspicion forinfection. The patient was continued on NSAIDs for pain. Therheumatology service followed the patient during his admissionthroughout.3. Cardiovascular: The electrophysiology service saw thepatient in the emergency department and interrogated hispacemaker. They concluded that it was sensing correctly.Following his joint washout , the patient did have an episode ofconfusion , and his heart rate was found to be in the low 100s.The EKG was difficult to interpret because of the patient'spacer , and enzymes were sent , which later came back negative.During his admission , a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard atthe right sternal border , thought to be a flow murmur , but itshould be worked up as an outpatient if it persists. The patientwas treated with metoprolol during his admission for hishypertension , and this was transitioned to atenolol , and he wasdischarged on atenolol 50 mg q.d.4.

She had recurrent chest pain five days later andwas retreated with TPA without improvement and then underwent PTCAof her left anterior descending artery. The left ventriculogram atthat time revealed an ejection fraction of 20%. This myocardialinfarction was complicated by pericardial tamponade and hypotensiontreated with pericardiocentesis. She also subsequent to this hadsuffered recurrent episodes of congestive heart failure andventricular tachycardia. An echocardiogram at this time revealed asignificantly decreased ejection fraction with a new leftventricular aneurysm and moderate mitral regurgitation. She wasevaluated for cardiac transplant but opted for Amiodarone andaneurysmectomy/AICD implantation. In February of 1991 a cardiaccatheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 18%. The patientwas seen in cardiomyopathy clinic on 1/18/95 and complained ofchills and weakness and subsequent urinalysis was consistent withurinary tract infection. She was started on Bactrim p.o. Sincethen she has had increased nausea and vomiting with three episodesof falling and imbalance. She denies dizziness , lightheadedness ,palpitations , or chest pain. She denies fever or chills althoughshe had rigors in the emergency room.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Ischemic cardiomyopathy. Hypertension.Increased cholesterol.

Pt had another episodeof nosebleed/clot while an inpatient , but no uncontrollable bleeding.There was no need to tamponade pt's nares , however , in light of her hxof menorrhagia , previous DVT/PE , and family hx of DVT's , it will beimportant to assess for different causes of hyper/hypocoagulability inthis pt as an outpt ( platelet d/o , von willebrand's disorder , hemophilia ,osler-weber-rendu d/o ). It will be also important to assess for possiblenasal AVM or ?tumor( low likelihood ). Coumadin was continued as pt hashigh risk of forming DVT's. Her BP was also controlled withHCTZ/triamterene and captopril to help control bleeding. Pt's BP droppedsignificantly in response to Lopressor and HR's were down in the 40's ,thus her Lopressor was held. Patient needed captopril for high BP , thuswill D/C on lisinopril 2.5. She needs to be followed up for compliance andunderstanding of importance of BP control , as patient was not compliant onmedications on presentation , had very high BP on presentation.2-chest pain: ACS vs PE vs GERD vs panic attacks. As pt has severalcardiac risk factors , her CE's were cycled and she was ruled out for MI.An Echo was obtained to assess for systolic dysfunction , but EF was 65% ,no effusions were found , and there was only mild MR. Pt does not have anofficial DM dx , however , given her obesity , she is at high risk forglucose intolerance , thus a HbA1C will need to be obtained as anoutpatient. Pt also has a hx of hypercholesterolemia , and a fasting lipidprofile was obtained. It will be important that she take her statinsregularly. The pt had palpable cords and calf tenderness ( L>R ) , so LENI'swere obtained prior to d/c and these were negative for DVT , although itwas a poor study due to her size. Pt also has a hx of GERD , thus the c/pmay have been 2/2 esophageal spasm or GERD as it radiated to the back andright shoulder. Pt denies having had spicy foods or nausea/vomiting beforethe episodes , however. Pt had chest tenderness along the sternum and Lribcage , which may have contributed to her feeling of c/p. Finally , ptseems to have a hx of anxiety , per herself and her daughters and as shefelt she was going to die and felt stressed during the nosebleeding , thiscould have caused her c/p. Patient had a adenosine MIBI prior to dischargeand this was negative for any ischemic changes , and she was discharged tohome to follow-up with her PCP for further medical management of cardiacrisk factors.3-Fibromyalgia: pt was asymptomatic , but we continued her home regimenand pain control.4-FEN: IVF were avoided given high BP on admission and K and Mag wererepleted as needed. She should continue a low choles/fat , and no saltadded diet.FULL CODEADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your blood pressure was very high on admission but was easily controlledwith blood pressure medication. This was probably due to not using yourblood pressure medications regularly. It is crucial that you take yourblood pressure medications regularly as prescribed as uncontrolled highblood pressure can lead to heart disease , kidney disease , and eyedisease. You must also watch your diet and eat low cholesterol , lowfat foods and no added sodium , as this can worsen your blood pressureor even lead to heart failure. You must also continue your coumadinregularly as prescribed as you have a high risk of forming blood clots.Please come to the ED if you have continued uncontrolled nose bleeds ,severe uncontrollable headaches , fainting spells , chest pain , orshortness of breath.DISCHARGE CONDITION: StableTO DO/PLAN:1. Follow-up HGBA1C , BP control , lipid panel , and chest pain with PCP asan outpatient.2. We recommend that the patient have a pharmacologic stress test as anoutpatient to evaluate for possible areas of potential cardiac ischemia.No dictated summaryENTERED BY: PURSIFULL , LINCOLN B. , M.D. ( PN70 ) 8/20/06 @ 04:37 PM****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******

The patient presented with substernalchest pain to the emergency room department with a blood pressureof 230/90. The patient's blood pressure was controlled with IVLopressor and the patient was admitted for rule out myocardialinfarction. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on5/18/99 which revealed the following: A stent restenosis of leftcircumflex artery , a 60 percent left anterior descending arterystenosis , a 70 percent diagonal ostial stenosis , a 40 percentostial right coronary artery stenosis , and 95 percent ostialposterior descending artery stenosis. No myocardial infarction wasnoted and ejection fraction was approximately 50 percentcalculated. The patient was subsequently scheduled for coronaryartery bypass graft.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease. Hypertension.Congestive heart failure. Type II diabetesmellitus requiring insulin. Peripheral vascular disease.Gastroesophageal reflux disease.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left lower extremity revascularization.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Spanish-speaking female. HEENT:Unremarkable. Carotid pulses 1 plusbilaterally with no bruits. Lungs clear to auscultationbilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.Abdomen: Soft , nontender , nondistended.

The patient had a recent admission at Doyle Health Care Services 7/20/04 through 10/17/04 with malignanthypertension and CHF. At that time , he had 3+ lower extremityedema , a BNP of 1374 , and an ejection fraction of 20%. On echo ,he was diuresed and lost 10 kg of fluid and was discharged tofollow up with the CHF Service. Since that time , he has beenmaintained on 60 mg p.o. of Lasix , recently increased to 60 mgb.i.d. , also with some recent increases in his Toprol XL andamlodipine. The patient presented to the emergency department onthe day of admission with an episode of weakness and blurredvision. He states that he was at work helping set up for a partyand he became somewhat week. His vision blurred and thisresolved when he sat down to rest. He reports having had onesimilar episode approximately one month ago , for which he did notseek medical care. He had no chest pain , no palpitations , noshortness of breath , no fever or chills at home and in the daysprior to the episode had had good appetite and no complaints ofdysuria.In the emergency department , his vitals were temperature 97.1 ,pulse 70 , and blood pressure 147/68. The patient wascomfortable. An EKG revealed a question of ST changes and it wasnoted that his creatinine was increased to 2.1 from his baselineof 1.4 and then his blood glucose was 307. He was admitted inorder to rule out myocardial infarction.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , coronary artery disease ,congestive heart failure , hypertension , cognitive deficits , andglaucoma.MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION: Amlodipine 7.5 mg ,Timoptic 0.5 one drop OU q.d. , aspirin 81 mg q.d. , Imdur 120 mgq.d. , Zestril 50 mg q.d. , Toprol XL 150 mg q.d. , Lasix 60 mgb.i.d. , glipizide XL 10 mg q.d. , and atorvastatin 40 mg q.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: Notable for the fact that the patient lives withhis mother and works at Ondo Carmi Medical Center Cafeteria.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for vitals as above.The patient's jugular venous pulsations were visible at less than10 cm. His heart was regular with S1 , S2 , S4 , and no murmurs.His lungs had bibasilar crackles , right greater than left. Hisabdomen was soft , nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly. Hisextremities were notable for no edema. Scattered excoriationswith quite long nails.LABS AT ADMISSION: Notable for a potassium of 5.3 , blood glucoseof 307 , creatinine of 2.1 , white blood count of 7 , and hematocritof 42. BNP was 118. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 62 , leftatrial enlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy , and T-waveinversions with ST changes in I , II , and V1 through V5. Chestx-ray showed stable cardiomegaly.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular: The patient ruled out for MI. He had nocomplaints of chest pain at any time during his admission.Initially , his Lasix and lisinopril were held in the context ofconcern over possible hypotension as an etiology of his episodeof weakness. However , these were restarted on the secondhospital day at slightly diminished doses compared to hisbaseline.2. Renal: The patient's creatinine improved and at the time ofdischarge , it was back to his baseline of 1.5.3. Endocrine: The patient's diabetes mellitus is very poorlycontrolled. At present , his hemoglobin A1c measured at admissionwas 11.4 indicating an average blood glucose level of greaterthan 300. While in-house , he continued to receive his baselinedose of glipizide XL , however , he was also covered with regularinsulin on a sliding scale. The patient has no prior history ofinsulin use at home. After consideration of the risks andbenefits of other oral agents including the high nature of hishemoglobin A1c , it was decided that insulin therapy would benecessary for adequate control of his diabetes. Various concernover the patient's ability to successfully manage insulin therapyat home and so , a simply regimen was selected. To begin with , hewas discharged on standing dose of 6 units of NPH in the morningand 6 units at bedtime to be given via a prefilled disposableinsulin pen that will involve no need to draw up the medicationhimself , but simply to select the correct dose and give theinjection.4. Neuro: The patient's episode of blurred vision did notrecur. It is possible that his hyperglycemia accounted for this.He did have an ophthalmologic exam one week prior to admissionthat revealed no problems. He had no other neurologic or visualsymptoms during his stay in the hospital.5. Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was somewhathyperkalemic at admission with a potassium of 5.3. This resolvedwith a single dose of Kayexalate and his potassium returned tonormal levels. The patient was discharged in stable condition on6/19/04 .  To receive close followup , he will have visitingnurses' visits including two visits the day after discharge inorder to assist with insulin management and he has an appointmentwith his primary care physician , Dr. Clifford Evanko , the day afterdischarge on 5/6/04 .MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mgp.o. b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Timoptic 0.5% one dropOU b.i.d. , Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 120 mg p.o. q.d. ,glipizide XL 10 mg p.o. q.d. , atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH insulin 6 units subcutaneouslyq.a.m. before breakfast and q.h.s.eScription document: 4-4544386 ISSten TelCC: Lane Strzyzewski M.D.Dictated By: ECKLES , TRUMANAttending: FEGER , OMAR LYLEDictation ID 4088169D: 1/5/04T: 10/11/04

On arrival in the emergency department , she was hypoxic andhypoglycemic , responding to fluids , intubation , and transfer to the MICU. Shewas subsequently transferredout of the medical ICU to the general medical floor. Of note , she had a recentadmission to Th Medical Center for sepsis secondary tocellulitis and pneumonia , enjoying that admission she developedATN secondary to antibiotic use. ROS on arrival to the medicine floor is notpossible , as the patient is disoriented( at baseline ). She does report low back pain ( chronic ) , is moaning at baseline( secondary to stroke/aphasia ) , but appears in NAD.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. COPD , for which she uses BiPAP at home and no oxygen.2. CHF , secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Ejection fractionis 55% with no wall motion abnormalities. She does have ahistory of elevated pulmonary artery pressures of 57 above ratereduction.3.

Morbidly obese. HEENT examination is significant for fixedleft pupil secondary to surgery , with a pinpoint right pupil.JVP cannot be assessed secondary to obesity. Pulmonary exam issignificant for diffuse rhonchi with wheezing. Cardiovascularexamination significant for a 2/6 systolic murmur at the leftlower sternal border. Extremities reveal 2+ pitting edema with2+ pulses.LABORATORY STUDIES: On admission were significant for sodium of149 , BUN of 49 , creatinine of 2.3 , glucose of 21 , white count of 13 , hematocritof 34 , platelets of 63 , 000 , an alkaline phosphatase of 284 , ALTof 82 , total bilirubin of 4.0 , direct bilirubin of 2.0 , albuminof 2.5 and an INR of 2.1. CXR reveals a RLL pneumonia.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Aspiration pneumonia. The patient was admitted with a rightlower lobe pneumonia. She grew MRSA in her sputum and wastreated with vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl. She did welland was extubated on her first hospital day after arriving in theMICU. However , she continued to aspirate and failed a bedsideswallow study in the MICU. She was stabilized and transported tothe medicine floor on overnight BiPAP. She again failed bedsideswallow evaluation with thin liquids , and was therefore startedon a very conservative pudding thick puree diet. She didsubsequently aspirate on secretions ( she was not eating at thattime ) and became acutely hypoxic with an ABG that showed a pH of7.45 , pCO2 of 48 and a PO2 of 36. Her family was brought in andit was explained that the patient was recurrently aspirating andwas critically ill. A family meeting was held , where it wasdecided that the patient would be DNR/DNI , and every attemptwould be made to bring the patient home with hospice. Sheactually stabilized from her acute event and was able to weanfrom BiPAP to 3 L oxygen nasal cannula. Nevertheless , thepatient's family understood that her respiratory status remainedtenuous and that she would likely re-aspirate. She wasdischarged home with hospice services per family request.2. CHF. The patient diuresed greater than 26 liters during thisadmission. Much of this diuresis was without pharmacologicalintervention , although she did receive minimal Lasix support. Atthe time of discharge , she was tending towards euvolemic or dry and wasnot on any Lasix. She was felt to be in the polyuric phase ofATN , which was resolving.3. Diabetes. The patient was discharged on insulin NPH and asliding scale regular insulin. Her doses have been decreasedbecause she was found to be hypoglycemic on admission.4. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. Given the patient's historyof bleeding ( she had a GI bleeding while in the MICU in thesetting of an INR of 2.0 ) , Coumadin was held. On review with themedical team , it was felt that the risk of stroke was faroutweighed by the risk of a significant bleed. Therefore , thepatient is not discharged on Coumadin.5. Acute renal failure. The patient was treated withantibiotics prior to this admission , and developed ATN secondaryto that medication. Of note , her urine was positive foreosinophils on admission. At the time of discharge , thepatient's creatinine was 2.1 , which in part was due to ATN andalso due to significant diuresis. Her baseline creatinine is 1.7and she is currently trending downwards.6. Thrombocytopenia. The patient is noted to have a chronicthrombocytopenia. This was exacerbated with heparin products ,which were discontinued. She did require platelet transfusionsfor a platelet count of 34 in the setting of acute bright redblood per rectum. However , her platelet count was stable atgreater than 125 on discharge.7. LFT abnormalities. A right upper quadrant ultrasound waswithin normal limits , although was of poor quality given thepatient's obese body habitus. She does have a possiblecholestatic picture , but the patient had no other symptoms.Given her DNR/DNI status with hospice services pending , nofurther workup was performed.8. Agitation. The patient is , at baseline , mourning anddisoriented , but responsive. She did require Haldol and Ativanp.r.n. , but also did well with 1 to 1 interaction. Morphine wasadequate for pain control.9. Speech and swallow evaluation. The patient failed severalspeech and swallow evaluations. She is put on a pudding thickpuree diet , but this is palliative , as she will very likelyaspirate even on this diet.10. Rheumatoid arthritis. The patient was continued onprednisone 20 mg q.a.m.DISCHARGE EXAMINATION: Temperature 96 , respiratory rate 22 ,pulse 68 , blood pressure 130/60 , oxygen saturation 99% on 3liters. Exam is notable for morbid obesity , coarse breathsounds , right greater than left , large ecchymosis of varyingstages particularly at subcutaneous injection sites , and baselinedisorientation , which is not different from the patient's usualmental status.LABORATORY STUDIES ON DISCHARGE: White count 11 , hematocrit 33 ,platelets 214 , 000 , glucose 134 , sodium 148 , chloride 111 , BUN 40and creatinine 2.1.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg q.2 h. p.r.n. ,Pepcid 20 mg p.o. at bedtime , insulin NPH 4 units SC b.i.d. ,insulin regular sliding scale , Ativan 2 to 4 mg p.o. q.6 h.p.r.n. anxiety , metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , prednisone 20 mgp.o. q.a.m. , morphine immediate release 15 to 30 mg p.o. q.3 h.p.r.n. pain , Norvasc 5 mg p.o. daily , levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.every other day for a total of two weeks , miconazole 2% topicalpowder b.i.d. , DuoNeb q.6 h. and Dulcolax rectal suppository 10mg PR daily.DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home in very poorcondition.

Acetest positive. White blood cell count 26.48 ,hematocrit 41.3 , MCV 89.9 , platelets 278. White blood celldifferential with 81 polys , 13 bands , 4 lymphs , 2 monos. EKGshowed normal sinus rhythm at 113 , axis equal to negative to 37 ,intervals equal to 152/90/450 , as well as old Qs in V1 and V2 , leftanterior hemiblock , left ventricular hypertrophy. Chest x-rayshowed no infiltrate , no effusions , cardiomegaly , or pulmonaryedema.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's glucose came down quickly with IVinsulin and aggressive hydration. Sheunfortunately ruled in for myocardial infarction with peak CK on4/13/99 of 285 , and peak troponin of 6.15 for which she wastreated with beta blockers , aspirin , and heparin , as well asZestril and Zocor. She had some recurrent episodes of chest painduring her admission following her non-Q wave myocardialinfarction.She also had an echocardiogram on 4/13/99 which showed an ejectionfraction of 45% , and hypokinesis in the middle and distalintraventricular septum. She had 1+ tricuspid regurgitation andpreserved right heart function.On 1/12/99 , she underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a40% osteo left main lesion and a 40% tapered distal lesion. Herleft anterior descending artery was diffusely diseased up to 50% inits mid portion. The first diagonal had a discrete 70% stenosis ,and the second diagonal had a discrete 90% stenosis. The rightcoronary artery had a 40% discrete proximal stenosis , the posteriordescending artery had a osteo 90% stenosis. The right circumflexhad an 80% proximal stenosis.The patient had an exercise stress test on 10/4/99 which was amodified Bruce. The patient completed a 9 minute test with amaximum heart rate of 100 , which was 65% of predicted. Her maximumblood pressure was 156/60. She was asymptomatic with no ST changesand remained in sinus rhythm. The test was therefore interpretedas negative for ischemia.It was thought that the patient would probably benefit from CABGprocedure but it was deferred secondary to patient preference , aswell as her infection. With regard to her infectious diseaseissues , the patient was treated with levofloxacin. Her white bloodcell count was persistently elevated. She had one urine culturewhich appeared contaminated and her blood cultures were negativefor this admission. She had a pelvic and abdominal CT on 2/1/99which demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , no evidence ofabscess , and punctate renal stones without evidence of obstructiveuropathy. Her fever resolved.First it was thought that the patient did have a urinary tractinfection. She maintained relatively benign urinalysis , which wascollected only hours after she received ceftriaxone , it wasdifficult to believe that she had ever had pyelonephritis. Becauseof her persistently elevated white blood cell count was alsounclear although it did finally decline. In short , the series ofevents that led up to her admission appeared likely to be urinarytract infection leads to tachycardia and demand related myocardialinfarction , and then combination of infection and myocardialinfarction leads to nonhepatic hyperosmolar state. Nonetheless , adifferent sequence of pathologies is also possible.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stablecondition.MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day; hydrochlorothiazide 25 mgp.o. q. day; NPH 30 units subcutaneously q.

STATUS POST ATHERECTOMY COMPLICATED BYREOCCLUSION AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.2. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.3. ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59 year old femalewith multiple cardiac risk factors whopresents with exertional chest discomfort and early positive ETT.The patient has a history of cardiac risk factors of obesity ,diabetes mellitus , and cholesterol. The patient describes a6-month history of exertional angina described as chest heavinesswith mild shortness of breath whenever she walked more than oneblock or climbed stairs. The patient is followed by Dr. Garrett H Lipkind , LMD at Skaemp Center .  She had an ETT on5/23/92 , modified Bruce protocol , in which she went 2 minutes and 2seconds , stopped secondary to typical anterior chest discomfort.The heart rate was 135 , 83% predicted. EKG changes weresignificant for 20 mm horizontal ST depressions in 1 , V4-5 , 1 mm STdepressions in II , III and F. The patient was referred for cardiaccatheterization. The patient denies orthopnea , PND , and has mildoccasoinal hypertension. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus , oral agent times six months. Asthma ,no recent symptoms. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glucotrol 7.5 mgp.o. q-day , Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Isoril 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,Propranolol 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n.ALLERGIES: ? ALLERGY TO UNRECALLED ANTIBIOTIC. FAMILY HISTORY:Brother required CABG in his 50's , mother died of heart disease ,age unknown.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 140/70 , pulse 70. Neck:negative JVD , 2+ carotids , without bruits.Chest: Clear to auscultation. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm ,S1 and S2 , a I/IV systolic ejection murmur heard best at the rightsternal border. Abdomen: Plus bowel sounds , nontender.Extremities: +2 femorals , no bruits , positive left DP , trace PT ,right positive 2 DP and plus 2 PT.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: BUN/creatinine 12/1.2 , glucose 318 ,hematocrit 42.3 , white blood cell count8.38 , cholesterol 222 , triglycerides 173.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent catheterization on 1/15/92 .She had a proximal 95% LAD lesion and diagonal 140% stenosis. She had an anomalous posterior circumflex withluminal irregularities. Her mean RA was 5 , and her mean capillarywedge pressure was 11. Her cardiac output was 6.2 , wifh an FCR of1226. The patient underwent athrectomy of her proximal LAD lesionthrough a 10 French arterial sheath. The stenosis was reducedfrom an 80% to 20% residual. The Heparin was shut off , andsheaths were pulled later that afternoon. Her post atherectomycourse was complicated on the evening of 11/12/92 by the onset ofsevere chest discomfort. The patient had significant flippedT-waves in III and F and 2 mm ST depressions as well in III and F.The patient was subsequently brought to the cath lab on 11/12/92where the LAD was found to be 100% occluded and was dilated to a30% residual with balloon PTCA. Thrombus was found at the priorathrectomy site. The patient was transferred to the Cardiac CareUnit after the PTCA which she proceeded to rule in for a myocardialinfarction with peak CPK's of 1390 with MB's of 55. The patient'spost PTCA course was complicated by several episodes of transientchest discomfort which was relieved both by Mylanta and sublingualTNG. These episodes were not compared with EKG nor felt to besecondary to recurrent dyspepsia. The patient on 2/9/92 , sevendays post MI , had a modified Bruce ETT where she went 9 minuteswithout any ischemic changes. The patient's blood sugars remainedelevated throughout her hospital course. She was maintained onGlucotrol with NPH subcu q.a.m. was added with the hope that thepatient would eventually after the stress of her MI , her bloodsugars would return to prior levels. The patient was thus treatedwith Mevacor for hypercholesterolemia. The patient was dischargedin good condition on 10/10/92 with followup with Dr. Kneisel in Frejames Ny'smiss Hospital .DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q-day ,Aspirin one p.o. q-day , Glucotrol 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,Isordil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH 26units subcutaneously each morning.GJ201/2130YONG S.

She was admitted on 11/10/95 with complaintof chest pain at rest without associated symptoms. There was nocomplaint of decreased exercise tolerance , exertional symptoms. NoPND , edema , nausea , vomiting , or diaphoresis at this time. Thecomplaint at that time was 3 out of 10 chest pressure whichspontaneously resolved. It recurred intermittently withoutassociated symptoms , no EKG changes. She was ruled out formyocardial infarction by enzymes and EKG. CKs were 156 , 135 , and108. She was treated with aspirin , beta blockers , andnitroglycerin. The concern was for a question of unequal bloodpressures in the patient and complaint of back pain. A GEE wasdone to rule out aortic dissection. On GEE there were no valvularabnormalities or evidence for dissection and no regional wallmotion abnormalities. ETT was done on 8/26/95 .  The patientexercised for 4 minutes 13 seconds on a standard Bruce protocol.She was stopped secondary to leg fatigue and dyspnea with a heartrate of 84 - 113 with a target of 138. Blood pressure was 136/80and elevated to 164/90. There were no EKG changes and no evidencefor ischemia on this study despite limited effort.On the evening of admission on 7/25/95 she again had the acuteonset of sharp , burning , mid-epigastric versus sternal pain withoutradiation and with associated shortness of breath , diaphoresis ,nausea , and an acid taste. She took two sublingual nitroglycerinswith relief of symptoms. The pain lasted a total of 15 minutes.She has been pain-free since arrival to the hospital.MEDICATIONS: Glucotrol 20 mg q.d. , Cardizem CD , Benadryl 50 mgt.i.d. , Provastatin 20 mg q.d. , Hydrochlorothiazide12.5 mg q.d. , Trazadone 50 mg q.h.s. , aspirin 1 q.d. , Lopressor 75mg q.d. , nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. , Ambien 5 mg q.h.s.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a receptionist. She has three children.She has never married. She lives alone.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was afebrile with blood pressure of132/96 , pulse 95. She was on one liter ofoxygen , saturation of 97%. Respiratory rate was 20. HEENT:Normal. No JVD. Lungs were clear. Heart: PMI was nondisplaced.Normal S1 and S2. No S3 or S4. No murmurs , gallops , or rubs.Abdomen: Soft but obese. Nontender , nondistended. Nohepatojugular reflux. No abdominal bruits. No pulsatile masses.Extremities: Without edema , cords , or femoral bruits.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable for potassium of 3.7 , magnesium1.9. Hematocrit 36 , WBC 11.5. CK firstset was 118. Triponin was 0.0. EKG was notable for normal sinusrhythm with occasional PVCs. Intervals and axis were within normallimits. There was a slight upper concavity and ST-T segment in V2and V3 when compared to old although this could be consistent withJ point elevation and a question of a 0.5 mm segment elevation inV2. The EKG was without change from previous admission.IMPRESSION: This is a 57 year old woman with multiple cardiac riskfactors presenting with complaint of substernal ,midepigastric pain , burning. Although she had multiple cardiacrisk factors , her pain is of an atypical quality and sounds moreconsistent with a gastrointestinal source. The GEE was asuboptimal study and it was deemed more appropriate on admission toboth rule the patient out but consider a pharmacologic stress testbefore cathing this patient.HOSPITAL COURSE: Since the patient's symptoms did sound moregastrointestinal , she was started on Axid forpossibility of gastroesophageal reflux disease , as well as providedwith Maalox and told to keep the head of the bed elevated. She wascontinued on Glucotrol for diabetes mellitus and was instructed onrisk factor modifications , including diabetes mellitus control ,controlling cholesterol and hypertension. She is currently anon-smoker.On the day following admission the patient was ruled out formyocardial infarction by enzyme sets respectively. A set was 118;B set was 105; C set was 105; D set was 100. EKGs were withoutchange. As well , the patient had remained symptom-free during thehospital course and was scheduled for a Dobutamine MIBI for6/23/95 .  The patient on Dobutamine MIBI study showed heart rategoing up from 70 to 101 , blood pressure 170/80 went up to 230/90.There were no EKG changes and no chest pressure.

No fevers , chills , or night sweats. Nopalpitations. No diaphoresis. No abdominal pain. Occasionaldiarrhea with loss of bowel control. No nausea or vomiting. Nodysuria. No hematuria. No bright red blood per rectum.CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath and failure to thrive.BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 73-year-old gentleman withend-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis , with ischemiccardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% who was treated for C. difficilecolitis and worsening CHF. The patient has a long history ofESRD secondary to hypertension and diabetes. He beganhemodialysis in January 2005. He also has a long history ofperipheral vascular disease status post right carotidendarterectomy and bilateral external iliac angioplasty as wellas atrial fibrillation and a history of CVA diagnosed by MRI withthe timing unknown , thought to be secondary to thrombi from hisatrial fibrillation. This gentleman presented with worseningshortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion as well as worseningdysphagia and anorexia on January , 2005. Apparently , he was ingood health or at least his usual state of health until April ,2005 , when he was admitted to Aton Norran Rehabilitation Hospital Of for GUsymptoms which are unclear and a loss of appetite. He stayedthere for 30 days and then transferred to a rehabilitationcenter. After being discharged there for 1 week , he developedworsening shortness of breath and was unable to answer the doorwhen his neighbor knocked. The neighbor brought him into the EDon January , 2005 , for acute shortness of breath , which thepatient described , has worsened over the past 3 to 4 days. Hehas gone from being able to walk across his apartment to now onlybeing able to take 3 to 4 steps before becoming progressivelyshort of breath , and he now sleeps on three pillows. In fact , hecurrently cannot even get through his HPI without 3- to 5-worddyspnea. He denies any PND. Concerning for his dysphagia , hefeels like he first lost weight when he was trying to control hisvolume status prior to hemodialysis initiation in early January2005. His goal was to be 114 pounds and he limited his intake inorder to maintain that weight instead of limiting his volume.About 2 months ago , he began losing his appetite. He states thatthis was because of the "his renal diet." It was unclear if thediet caused this loss of appetite or his loss of appetite wasprior to the diet. Over the past 3 weeks , he has notedprogressive difficulty in swallowing solid foods. He is able toswallow liquids. Since discharge from rehabilitation a weekprior to admission , he is only able to take liquids. He quoteshe cannot even take noodles and soup. He has no nausea orvomiting unless attempting to swallow solids and no abdominalpain. His throat is sore and dry. He constantly wants water andice. Also concerning is the report , it is unclear , about a 20-to 40-pound weight loss over the past 2 to 3 months. In the ED ,he was afebrile; heart rate 105; blood pressure 136/70;respirations 18; and 97% on room air. He was given Lopressor forrate control for his atrial fibrillation. His EKG showed new Twave inversions in the inferolateral leads and Q waves , whichwere new for his baseline in the inferior leads. There was alsoan S1 , Q3 , T3 , which was new but absent once his rate wascontrolled.The patient was admitted to the floor and briefly transferred tothe unit for refractory hypertension , though he was found to haveright subclavian stenosis and blood pressure was checked in theleft arm. His blood pressure was fine at 100 to 110 systolic.He was then transferred back to the floor. An abdominal CT wasdone on September , 2005 , which showed marked edematous colonicwall beginning on the ascending colon all the way through to therectum. The differential diagnosis at this time waspseudomembranous colitis versus ischemic bowel. His lactatelevel was normal. He had a benign examination , and because ofthe distribution and the past antibiotic use , it was felt that hemost likely had C. difficile , which was found to be culturepositive on August , 2005. He had an echocardiogram , whichrevealed an EF of 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis and akinesisas compared to an echocardiogram done at the outside hospital inJanuary 2005 with an EF of 30% to 35%. He had severe TR. On July , 2005 , while on hemodialysis , he had an episode of substernalchest pain. Enzymes were sent and troponin peaked at 18. An EKGshowed ST depressions in V2 through V6 , which resolved with ratecontrol. He received aspirin and heparin and continued hisLopressor and statin. The decision was made not to catheterize ,as he was a poor candidate likely to have three-vessel diseaseand not a surgical candidate. The patient made the decision withthe cardiologist , family , and the team. The patient wasscheduled for an EGD and colonscopy to evaluate his dysphagia andcolitis , but this was deferred secondary to the incident of thenon-ST-elevation MI on January , 2005. Subsequently , the patientwas managed medically for his worsening CHF and shortness ofbreath with fluid removal at hemodialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays ,and Saturdays. The patient began Flagyl p.o. 500 mg t.i.d. onJanuary , 2005 , which should be continued through August ,2005 , for a full 14-day course.IMPRESSION: This is a 73-year-old man with acute worseningshortness of breath in the setting of a 20-plus-pound weightloss , increasing dysphagia , and progressive fatigue for the past2 months. He was found to have Clostridium difficile colitis andischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. Hiscourse was complicated by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctionon January , 2005 , with a troponin peak of 18 , which was likelydemand ischemia from tachycardia in the congestive heart failuresetting. His EGD and colonscopy was postponed secondary to thenon-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was managedmedically with fluid removal with hemodialysis for congestiveheart failure. He continues Flagyl p.o. for Clostridiumdifficile treatment. He was transferred on July , 2005 , to arehabilitation facility.PROBLEMS BY SYSTEMS:1. Gastrointestinal: We are treating his C. difficile colitiswith p.o. Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. from January , 2005 , throughJuly , 2005. His stool did grow out Staphylococcus aureus ,but this was likely from colonization from his mouth flora , andtherefore , we are not treating. Per ID consult , we are holdingall other antibiotics and treating only when cultures arepositive. He had a planned EGD and colonscopy , which waspostponed due to the NSTEMI on January , 2005. He should have ascope done , both upper and lower , 2 to 3 months down the roadonce the patient is stable. His LFTs were noted to bump onJuly , 2005 , but now are trending down; that is likelysecondary to either shock liver or just his NSTEMI. Continue tomonitor them at rehabilitation. The patient is unable to swallowsolids and is currently on a full liquid diet. After EGD ,consider barium swallow if nondiagnostic. The patient refuses NGtube , so encourage p.o. intake. He will take Nepro if asked. Heshould have at least 100 cc of Nepro a day.2. Cardiovascular: CHF with an EF of 10% to 15% with globalhypokinesis compared to January 2005 EF of 30% to 35%. He hassevere MR and TR. He is on Lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. and captopril12.5 t.i.d. with blood pressure tolerating well. He was startedon digoxin 0.25 three days a week on Sunday , Wednesday , andFriday , and his current digoxin level is 0.9 on July , 2005.He was wet on examination routinely and so it was taken offbetween 1 to 3 liters at hemodialysis regularly. He had anNSTEMI on January , 2005 , with troponin peak of 18 , likely demandischemia from CHF. Continue aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin.We discontinued the heparin after 24 hours. A decision was madenot to catheterize , as he is a poor candidate likely to havethree-vessel disease. EKG currently shows Q waves inferiorlywith ST depressions in V3 through V4 and T wave inversions in V3through V6. The depressions improved with rate control. He doeshave a low blood pressure in the right upper extremity , which isfalse due to a right subclavian stenosis; always check bloodpressures in the left arm. He has atrial fibrillation and heused to be on diltiazem for rate control. He was on Lopressorwith good effect. He was restarted on his Coumadin dose at 4 mgq.h.s. on July , 2005 , for anticoagulation. He is ontelemetry. He should be monitored of his INR for a goal INR of 2to 3 for his atrial fibrillation and change of Coumadin asaccordingly.3. Endocrine: Now on half-strength NovoLog sliding scale. Hehas had trouble with hyperglycemia for the past several days.His fingersticks can go up to 250. We think this is okay not tocover , as when we choose to cover him , he dips down into the 40s.4. Pulmonary: On admission , he had acute shortness of breathand tachycardia. An EKG showed S1 , Q3 , T3. PE CT was negative.There was no parenchymal disease. Some hilar lymph nodes werenoted. His repeated chest x-rays were every other day , whichonly showed changes in the CHF status. There was routinely noconsolidation or interstitial disease seen. His last chest x-rayshowed bilateral pulmonary edema and that was on July , 2005.5. Infectious Disease: We are only doing Flagyl p.o. for C.difficile treatment. He should continue 500 mg t.i.d. p.o.through August , 2005 , holding all other antibiotics. Wequestioned if he is septic when his temperatures drop to 95 to96 , but all blood , sputum , and urine cultures have been no growthto date. You could consider a third generation cephalosporin ifa pneumonia develops.6. Renal: Hemodialysis on Saturday , Tuesday , and Thursday.7. Hematology: He has anemia. Panel workup with mixed pictureof iron and chronic anemia. We are repleting his iron withvitamin C. He received 1 unit on October , 2005 , athemodialysis. His current hematocrit is 31. Guaiac stools havebeen negative.8. He has a malignancy workup , which has been negative so far.He has a normal TSH , PSA , and free PSA. No mass is seen onabdominal CT or chest CT.9. Prophylaxis: He is on heparin subcutaneously and Nexium.10. Disposition: He is going to rehabilitation today on February , 2005.11. Code status: DNR/DNI.12. Health care proxy: His brother , Son Gonzaliz ,167-227-0450.PLAN TO DO:1. Hemodialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays.2. Continue Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. from January , 2005 , toAugust , 2005.3.

He also described anew shortness of breath on admission , a cough with whitishsputum , no blood in his cough. He denied dyspnea on exertion ,but did report being short of breath while lying flat , ororthopnea. He did not describe any PND. He also reported afever on admission with some chills and sweats for two daysbefore being presented to the emergency department. He alsodescribed a decrease in his urine output one day prior toadmission and dysuria x2 days. The patient denied any nausea ,vomiting , diarrhea , chest pain or pressure. No palpitations , andno dyspnea on exertion.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Significant for end-stage renal disease , aortic valve replacementin 6/24 , left buttock ulcer , also followed by Plastic Surgery ,hypertension , diabetes mellitus type II , congestive heartfailure , and hypercholesterolemia.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Included CellCept 1000 mg b.i.d. , prednisone 20 mg daily ,valacyclovir 400 mg daily , calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily , metoprolol25 mg b.i.d. , Bactrim single strength daily , NPH 16 units q.a.m. ,18 units q.p.m. , NovoLog 6 units q.a.c. with sliding scale ,Nexium 20 mg daily , Colace 100 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily ,multivitamin , and tramadol 50 mg q.i.d.ALLERGIES:He reports no known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:His temperature was 97.7 , his heart rate was 93-97 , hisrespiratory rate was in the 30s , his blood pressure was 167/90 ,and his O2 saturation was 97-99% on 2 liters. In general , he wasin fairly significant distress. He had difficulty catching hisbreath. His head and neck exam is significant for equal , roundand reactive pupils. No cervical lymphedema , and no icterus.His JVP was up to about 12 cm. He did not have any carotidbruits. His cardiovascular exam was significant for rate andrhythm that were regular at 2/6 systolic ejection murmur andheard best in the right upper sternal border. He did not have S3or S4. His chest incision was clean , dry and intact. Hispulmonary exam was significant for crackles bilaterally about ahalfway up his back. His abdomen was soft , nontender , andnondistended , with positive bowel sounds. Incision of theabdomen was similarly clean , dry and intact. His extremitieswere significant for 3-4+ lower extremity edema , significantpitting to the thighs , and some dependent decubitus edema aswell. He had 2+ pitting edema in his left upper extremity. Hehad a fistula on his right arm. He has a decubitus sacral ulcerwith a VAC dressing in place on admission. Neurologic exam wassignificant for alert and oriented x3. His cranial nerves wereall intact. He had no focal deficits.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: Status post CABG and AVR. Onadmission , we held the patient's anticoagulation for a possiblebiopsy of his kidney. We continued his Lopressor at b.i.d.dosing. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Hehad four-beat runs of NSVT on the day of admission , which he didnot repeat after repletion of his electrolytes. He had chestpain again on hospital day #3 overnight. He did not have any EKGchanges with his chest. He was given Lopressor x1 , he ruled outonce again. The pain that he had developed was thought to belikely incisional and not cardiac. Pulmonary exam: The patientdeveloped acute worsening of pulmonary status while in theobservation area at the emergency department on admission onhospital day #1. He had an increasing O2 requirement , worseningpulmonary exam , and a chest x-ray that showed pulmonary edema.He was not diuresing effectively with more than 360 mg with IVLasix , which was administered to him in the emergency department ,so Renal was called urgently to see him in observation and he wassent for urgent dialysis. At dialysis , they removed greater than4 liters of fluid and the patient was patient was symptomaticallyimproved. He did continue to have lower extremity edemapost-dialysis and an oxygen requirement of 2 liters nasal cannulato maintain his oxygen saturation. He was given IV Lasix 80 mgx1 on hospital day #4 with excellent urine output. His lowerextremity edema improved significantly after hospital day #4.2. Renal: On admission , the patient's creatinine was 5.3. Itpeaked at 6.6 and trended down to 5.1 with clear signs ofimprovement. On admission , there was no improvement in his urineoutput with large doses of IV Lasix , however , and Renal wasconsulted to clarify whether this was an acute rejection versusATN from toxic doses of cyclosporin. In the emergencydepartment , he was given one dose of Solu-Medrol 500 mg , however ,he was found to have elevated cyclosporin levels at 679 , so thiswas thought to be the likely cause of his acute renal failure andhis cyclosporin was temporarily held. Since that time , on hishospital day #1 , his cyclosporin levels trended down to the pointat which there were just slightly over 100 on hospital day #3 andcyclosporin was reinitiated at lower doses. He was dialyzed onadmission with removal of 4 liters of fluid , CVM , BK , and LDHwere sent from dialysis. His creatinine improved , so furtherdialysis and biopsy were deemed unnecessary.3. ID status: The patient presented with UTI on admission.This was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg x1 and then 250 mgq.48h. for a course of seven days. Blood cultures grew 4/4Gram-negative rods , and the patient was diagnosed with urosepsis.After dialysis , the patient was treated with ceftriaxone 1 gdaily and continued on levofloxacin 250 mg q.4-8h. Transplantand Infectious Disease was consulted who recommended ceftriaxonebe discontinued and the levofloxacin to be continued for twoweeks after discharge with repeat cultures. HSV swap from sacralwound was sent. These repeat cultures and HSV swab were allnegative , and levofloxacin was continued for two weekspostdischarge.4. FEN: We held the patient's fluids. We checked his I's andO's on a daily basis with daily weights. His hyperkalemia onadmission was 6.1 , resolved with Kayexalate , insulin and D50meds. He was given additional Kayexalate when he came up to thefloor and his K resolved , backed down to his normal range. Thepatient was kept on a renal and cardiac diet. His albumin andtotal protein were low , so a nutritional consult was called ,which optimized his nutritional status.5. Endocrine: The patient had a tight glycemic control on NPH16 units q.a.m. and 19 units q.p.m. , NovoLog 6 units q.a.c. withsliding scale , and the patient's sacral decubitus ulcer had a VACdressing in place on admission. Plastics was called to addresshis VAC. They took down the VAC due to some leakage on admissionand he was treated with 1/4 Dakin's solution and wet-to-drydressing t.i.d. On discharge , he continued on the wet-to-drydressings. He will be followed as an outpatient VNA , and willhave the VAC replaced by the VNA as an outpatient. Hishematocrit was stable throughout his hospital stay.6. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Nexium throughout hishospital stay and we held his anticoagulation for possiblebiopsy. He will resume his outpatient anticoagulation and INRchecks with his INR Follow-Up Clinic. He was able to leave thefloor for cigarettes , and he signed an agreement suggesting thathe was going to tolerate the risk of leaving the floor for shortperiod of time even while on telemetry.On discharge , his medications included calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o.daily , Colace 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin 16 units q.a.m. , 18units q.p.m. , ketoconazole 200 mg daily , Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d. ,prednisone 20 mg q.a.c. , cyclosporin 125 mg b.i.d. , tramadol 50mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. for pain , Bactrim single strength one tabletp.o. daily , CellCept 1000 mg b.i.d. , valacyclovir 500 mg daily ,levofloxacin 250 p.o. every other day x2 weeks , NovoLog 6 unitsq.a.c. , Neoral 125 mg b.i.d. , and aspirin 325 mg daily.The patient was discharged to home in stale condition.eScription document: 3-5245631 EMSSten TelDictated By: CLANCY , JACOBAttending: RAMEY , GAYLEDictation ID 2973351D: 7/9/05T: 7/9/05

He had an angioplasty to 20% residual , whichwas complicated by a small dissection. He had an LV gram withinferior hypokinesis , and he also had an 80% OM1 lesion that wasangioplastied to 30% residual. His ejection fraction was 53%. Hehas been subsequently followed as an outpatient without recurrenceof his anginal symptoms. Approximately six weeks prior toadmission , his Vasotec was changed to Cozaar and his Niacin waschanged to Pravachol. At that time , he began having someintermittent substernal chest pain , both at rest and with exertion.Two weeks prior to admission , he was admitted to an outsidehospital with a complaint of chest pain. He is without currentmyocardial infarction. He had an exercise tolerance test and wasthen discharged. The results of the exercise tolerance test werenot available at the time of admission here. There was a questionof an irregular heartbeat during his exercise and he stopped theprocedure secondary to fatigue. The patient stopped his ownPravachol and he changed from Cozaar to Vasotec 10 mg q.day , atthat time. As mentioned above , the patient has had increasedfrequency of substernal chest pain , both at rest and with exertionover the last six weeks. At 2 a.m. on the day of admission , thepatient experienced a substernal chest pain as a dull ache withoutradiation. He had no other associated symptoms. He does notassociate the pain with any particular level of exertion , that itcan happen sitting still or with activity without any particularpattern. With today's episode , he had climbed two flights ofstairs and then developed this chest pain which lasted for 10-15minutes. It was not relieved with rest or after one to two tabs ofsublingual nitroglycerin. By the time he arrived at the EmergencyDepartment , his chest pain was gone. In the Emergency Department ,his systolic blood pressure was noted to be 230 and he was treatedwith nifedipine times one and IV nitroglycerin which brought hisblood pressure down to 140/90 and he was admitted for evaluation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , as above.Hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus times five years , diet controlled , and nasal polyps.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Aspirin , Vasotec 5 mg p.o. q.day , atenolol5 mg p.o. q.day.ALLERGIES: Penicillin and Toprol.FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of coronary artery disease at age48.

Heoccasionally will bicycle eight miles at a time or be able to walksix miles at a time two to three times a work. He has not donethis since this summer.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was in no acute distress , no chest pain.His temperature was 97.1 , blood pressure140/70 , pulse 68 , saturation 96% on room air , and respiratory rate14. HEENT examination revealed extraocular muscles were intact.Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation.Oropharynx was clear. Neck revealed no JVD , no bruits. Lungs wereclear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination wasbradycardic , normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.Abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended with positive bowelsounds , no organomegaly. Rectal examination was guaiac negativeper Emergency Department. Extremities had no cyanosis , clubbing ,or edema. There were 2+ pulses , DP and PT. Neurologicalexamination revealed he was alert and oriented times three , grosslynonfocal.LABORATORY DATA: EKG revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 43intervals 0.133 , 0.121 , 0.483 , axis 48 ,interventricular conduction delay , and small ST depression in V4and V5 of 0.5 mm. Chest x-ray revealed no edema , no infiltrate ,question of opacity in the right upper lobe versus first rib.Sodium was 141 , potassium 5.1 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 25 , BUN12 , creatinine 0.9 , alkaline phosphatase 81 , LDH 298 , troponin I 0 ,and CK 96.ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history ofcoronary artery disease , status post myocardialinfarction and status post angioplasty of his left circumflex andOM1 branches , admitted with unstable angina over the past six weeksafter a severe episode of chest pain the day prior to admission ,causing orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He wasadmitted for evaluation and for control of severe hypertension.HOSPITAL COURSE: CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient's blood pressure wascontrolled nicely initially on IV nitroglycerin. His Vasotec wasincreased to 10 mg b.i.d. and then discontinued. He was weaneddown off of the IV nitroglycerin and started on Imdur 60 mg p.o.b.i.d. and was also started on losartan , which was tapered up to 75mg p.o. q.day with improved control of his blood pressure. Thepatient apparently had a poor reaction to Norvasc in the past , sothis medication was not tried.On 1 of September September 1996 , he underwent cardiac catheterization whichshowed a right atrial pressure of 6 , right ventricular pressure36/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 40/16 , mean of 23 , pulmonarycapillary wedge pressure mean of 11 , left ventricular pressure195/36 , cardiac output 5.3 , and cardiac index 2.5. He had a 70%LAD lesion and a 50% first diagonal branch lesion. Circumflex wasokay and he had 40% and 25% serial RCA lesions. A 3.0 micron stentwas placed in the proximal LAD down to a residual of 25%. He wasstarted on Ticlid and continued on heparin for 48 hours.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , atenolol 50 mgp.o. q.day , nitroglycerin sublingual q.5minutes p.r.n. , Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.day , losartan 75 mg p.o. q.day ,and Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to be taken for one month.FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Eisentrout next week.Dictated By: DARRYL E.

He rarely drinks alcohol ,and denied initial drug surgery.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: His initial height was 5 feet9-1/2 inches. His weight was 318 pounds on admission.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He came to Miwest Child University Medical Centerfor an attempted lap banding on 7/30/2005 .  Unfortunately duringthe surgery , there was damage to the thoracic aorta and theattempted lap banding turned into an exploratory laparotomy ,median sternotomy , left thoracotomy , and aortic injury repair.He suffered cardiac arrest on the operating room table. Lefthemothorax and cardiac tamponade secondary to the descendingthoracic aortic laceration which was repaired intraoperatively ,and his abdomen was left open temporarily with a ??____?? bag andpartial VAC sponge , and he was admitted to the unit on pressors.HOSPITAL COURSE: Notable for a couple of major events over thepast couple of months , and we will go to those major events. On7/25/2005 , Mr. Benck was weaned off pressors. On the10/15/2005 , the mediastinal chest tube was discontinued. On1/2/2005 , his creatinine started to increase. On 4/15/2005and 10/12/2005 , the patient was bronched for respiratory distresswith resolution of the respiratory distress. On 10/18/2005 , hewas taken down to the operating room to increase the size of theendotracheal tube. His abdominal wound dehisced en route , a Jtube was placed , a left triple lumen catheter was placed , and hisexploratory laparotomy wound was able to be closed with waxsponge to be on top of the wound closure. On 4/30/2005 , he hada tap of his left chest. There was fluid collection there fromthe left thoracotomy. On 8/8/2005 , the left chest tube wasplaced and on 1/11/2005 , a left chest tube was discontinued. On2/7/2005 , he was trached and two chest tubes were placed and aleft VATS was completed again , because of a persisted fluidcollection. On 4/24/2005 , a right PICC was placed and thetriple lumen and his A line were discontinued. On 6/10/2005 , aTEE was done that showed normal valves with no vegetations and nomajor regional wall motion abnormalities. On 9/30/2005 , histrach was changed to a #7. On 2/10/3005 , his trach was changedto a #8 Portex. On 11/28/2005 , he had a renal ultrasound foragain a slowly rising creatinine that did not show any evidenceof hydronephrosis. On 3/23/2005 , CVVH was started after Quintonwas placed in the right IJ , on 5/4/2005 , his #8 Portex trachwas replaced with a #8 Shiley. On 10/18/2205 , a clot developedin the CVVH catheter. On 1/25/2005 , a wound which was beingseen periodically by I&D has had periodic wound I&Ds and VACchanges. On 6/23/2005 , the right IJ Quinton was discontinuedand a right IJ tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed. On2/7/2005 , he had a metabolic heart and began to trach collarfor increasing amounts of time. On 9/20/2005 and 12 ,there was report that his J tube had been slightly displaced andthen had been pushed in by the ICU team. The patient developedleft lower quadrant pain. He was sent down for the CT of theabdomen and pelvis , and now the J tube was not fully visualized Ithink because it is radiolucent to extravasation of contrast wasnot seen and surgery team felt that it was okay to continue tubefeeds safely which we have with no problems. On 6/16/2005 , hedesaturated when he went down for an ultrasound for the leftupper extremity in order to rule out clot because again the leftupper extremity had been swelling , so no studies was completed.He developed rigor short after with the temperature to 104 , somemild hypotension and tachycardia. TEE at the bedside show nodissection or intimal flap blood cultures were drawn. His PICCwas discontinued and the tip was sent for culture , and hereceived doses of levofloxacin and vancomycin. He was able toeventually J-collar through this. On 3/26/2005 , a 3 out of 4gram negative rods which ended up being enterobacter werecultured out. We believe that he suffered a transient bacteremiafrom the PICC. Levofloxacin was started and ID was consultedbecause the enterobacter was resistant about everything exceptamikacin and imipenem. On 10/3/2005 , allergy was also consultedand restarted an imipenem desensitization process which he hascompleted , and he is now on imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours for atotal course of 15 days that was started on 10/3/2005 , and aPICC was replaced. Today , he was planning to go to hemodialysisin order to exchange the dialysis catheter over wire not that itis not functioning but because of this transient bacteremia wewould like to give them a new hemodialysis catheter. He has beenable to get hemodialysis with , though some 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 unitsof heparin has to be given beforehand in order for the cathetersto flush well , and he will also be going for left upper extremityeither ultrasound or venogram to again rule out a clot in theleft upper extremity due to the increased swelling. His lasttemperature here is 98.3 today. His blood pressure runssystolics 90 to 110 with a heart rate in the 90s to 110s. He ison no drips or IV fluids , just his full strength Nepro of 55which is his goal and he is essentially anuric , but when we dostraight caths which we tend to do once every 1-2 days , he putsout usually 100-200 cc of urine and he has been J-collaringsuccessfully now for over three or four days saturations in the95% to 100% and an FiO2 of 40%. OT and PT have also been seeinghim.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:Neurologically , his mental status has much improved. He hadinitially some ICU delirium after the initial surgery that hasreally greatly improved. He right now is on no major moodstabilizers or antipsychotics. We do give him oxycodone forpain , which he really has had to use.Pulmonarywise , we have kept him on J-collar when he does need togo for a procedure we do send down the vent in case just becausehe is still fairly large person and may need the ventilatorysupport for positioning. He is right now on Combivent and DuoNebnebulizers p.r.n.Cardiovascularwise , his blood pressure has been stable and so hashis tachycardia. The beta-blocker that he was initially onLopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. was stopped secondary to the imipenemdesensitization the feeling being that if he did has ananaphylactic reaction , the epinephrine needed unopposed actionand we did not want any beta-blocker on board. We have held andwould continue it starting at a low dose after he completes hiscourse of imipenem.Gastrointestinalwise , he is on tube feeds which he tolerates verywell and there are no issues any more with the J-tube position.We are requesting a bedside speech and swallow official consult ,though he has been tolerating ice chips and ice cream withabsolutely no problems on p.o. He is also on Pepcid IV for GIprophylaxis.Genitourinarywise , he gets hemodialysis every other day. Theyhave been taking 4-5 liters per day and again with straightcatheterizing once every 1-2 days and usually get about a 100 ccto 200 cc of urine. Renal has been following him , and they areunhappy with his course of dialysis. Again , the hemodialysiscatheter is to be wire exchanged today , which is 11/5/2005 , butagain they have been able to use it just fine so far.Hematologywise , he is on heparin subcutaneous 10 , 000 units t.i.d.Endocrinewise , we have been checking his fingersticks and he isright now on Lantus 15 units subcutaneous b.i.d. with a slidingscale for coverage. He has just been following the fingersticksthat way and imipenem , he is to continue for 14-day course totalof imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours. The first dose was given inthe a.m. on 10/3/2005 , and there are no new culture resultsafter the gram-negative enterobacter was found. All othersurveillance and urine culture have been negative.eScription document: 5-1134888 MFFocusDictated By: CREMINS , HERSHELAttending: MORGANSON , TOBYDictation ID 4016589D: 1/14/05T: 1/14/05

Thisdictation will review her hospital course from 10/27/06 through10/6/06 .ADMIT DIAGNOSIS:Abdominal wound dehiscence.PRIMARY DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:Respiratory failure status post tracheostomy , wound dehiscencewith VAC sponge placement.SECONDARY DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:Morbid obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , COPD - on home oxygenand BiPAP , settings 15/10 , hypercholesterolemia , paroxysmalatrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease - with echo dated3/23/05 with EF of 65% and mild AS.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:This is a 77-year-old female who was transferred originally froman outside hospital for continued care after a fascial dehiscencestatus post subtotal colectomy. She was originally admitted tothe outside hospital on 10/10/05 with abdominal pain. The CTscan showed free air. She also had acute renal failure with acreatinine of 1.8. She was taken to the operating room where sheunderwent exploratory laparotomy and where she was found to havea mid descending colonic perforation secondary to diverticulitis.She underwent a partial left colectomy and end colostomy withHartmann's pouch. She was placed on clindamycin and levofloxacinpostoperatively. She was extubated on postoperative day #3. Shehad persistent elevated white blood cell count for which theychanged antibiotics to Flagyl and fluconazole. A CT scanrevealed questionable dehiscence of her abdominal wound and abinder was placed. She was subsequently found to be C. diffpositive. She was reintubated for respiratory distress onpostoperative day #7 along with decreased blood pressures andincreased white blood cell count. She was started onhydrocortisone and pressors were also started. She was extubatedon postoperative day #13 and was started on p.o. medssubsequently. She was started on her home BiPAP settings. Sheis also started on diltiazem drip for her paroxysmal atrialfibrillation. She was transferred over to the Vau Haain Medical Center for surgical intervention of her abdominal wounddehiscence.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Morbid obesity.2. COPD , on home O2 and BiPAP sittings 15/10.3. Hypercholesterolemia.4. Obstructive sleep apnea.5. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.6. Coronary artery disease - echo dated 3/23/05 with an EF of65% and mild AS.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:1. Total abdominal hysterectomy with BSO.2. Exploratory laparotomy with left colectomy and end-colostomyand Hartmann's pouch.Please see the previously dictated discharge summary for theremainder of her course up to date of 10/27/06 .OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:1. On 4/16/06 , tracheostomy.2. On 2/18/06 , percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubeinsertion.BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE FROM 10/27/06 THROUGH 9/10/06:Neuro: The patient was maintained on oxycodone per NG tubeinitially and then per G-tube for analgesia. She also receivedSeroquel for agitation and hallucinations. Upon discharge torehabilitation , the patient was alert and oriented , moves allextremities and following commands. She had good pain control onoxycodone elixir and Seroquel.Cardiovascular: The patient remained hemodynamically stableafter her initial septic event. She remained in a normal sinusrhythm for the remainder of her ICU course. She was maintainedon Lopressor 100 per per G-tube q.i.d. Her pressures toleratedthis dose.Pulmonary: The patient continued on BiPAP failing each trial offthe BiPAP. She would become tachypneic and desaturate withelevation of her pCO2 once off BiPAP. After several days offBiPAP trials , the decision was made and discussed with the familyand the patient regarding her need for tracheostomy. It wasexplained to her that tidal volumes were low and would drop offBiPAP and that she would benefit from a tracheostomy placement.The patient was consented and informed and taken to the operatingroom on 4/16/06 where she underwent a tracheostomy. Shetolerated the procedure well. She was quickly weaned to pressuresupport ventilation. She was maintained on minimal vent settingsfor a couple of days postoperatively. She was eventually trachcollared , as she has been over the last three to four days. Thepatient does tire out after two to three hours of trach collar ,after which we placed her back to pressure support ventilation.The patient has also had some mild bilateral pleural effusion onchest x-ray that has not progressed and has been stablethroughout her course. The patient has a history of obstructivesleep apnea and COPD at baseline. The patient received inhalerand nebulizers standing and p.r.n. She will need to continue hertrach collar trials most likely having more trach collar trialsat smaller intervals. The patient's current vent settings upondischarge to rehabilitation are pressure support 5 and 10 , tidalvolumes 350-400 , breathing at a rate of 23 , and saturating 99% onan FIO2 of 40%.GI: Patient's abdomen remained stable with a VAC sponge. Shehad her VAC sponge changed as needed twice a week with goodgranulation tissue forming. There were no signs of infection.Due to the patient's respiratory failure and need fortracheostomy , patient also underwent a PEG placement on 2/18/06 .She tolerated this procedure well. Medications were started onthe day of surgery and her tube feeds were resumed onpostoperative day #1 from her PEG. The patient is currentlyreceiving Two Cal formula tube feeds at a rate of 45 , which isher goal rate. She should continue on that. The patient may bechanged to Jevity if she needs more fluid volume. The patient'sabdomen is soft , VAC sponge in place to suction and draining ,ostomy is functioning well and viable with good output. Thepatient should continue on a H2 blocker for a PPI while on thevent.GU: The patient is still somewhat fluid overloaded most likelydue to third spacing due to poor nutrition andhyperprolactinemia. The patient was aggressively diuresedthroughout her stay with the Lasix drip , and albumin and albuminand Lasix combination. Over the last few days prior to dischargeto rehab , the patient has responded to boluses of Lasix , actuallydiuresing quite well and being negative 500 to a liter negativedaily. The patient's weight is actually down from admission.The patient's urine output is approximately 80 to 100 mL an hourafter a 40 mg bolus of Lasix. The Lasix medication has been heldat this time due to increasing her sodium to 148 on the morningof discharge. The patient will not be discharged on Lasix.However , the patient may need a dose of Lasix at 20-40 mg if herurine output drops off. Upon discharge , the patient has about 1+edema bilaterally. The patient's electrolytes upon discharge aresodium 148 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 96 , CO2 , and bicarbonate 40 ,BUN 33 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 128 , calcium 9.6 , and magnesium1.7.Heme: The patient remained stable from a Hematology standpoint.Her hematocrit upon discharge was 32. The patient has normalCoags , INR 1 and PTT 27.3. The patient was maintained onsubcutaneous t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis in addition , toPneumoboots. The patient was also started on darbepoetin aftergetting iron studies before poor nutrition. There is no signs ofactive bleeding.ID. After patient's sepsis , she remained relatively afebrilethroughout the rest of her stay. She was VRE positive , grewEnterococcus from her ostomy. She had no new positive culturesfor the rest of her course. She was maintained off antibioticsfor the rest of her course.Endocrine: The patient was maintained on tight glycemic control.She is written for insulin sliding scale approximately q.6 h. inaddition , to a standing regular insulin 4 units q.6 h. plusLantus 15 units q.h.s. The patient's sugars have still beenmoderately elevated from about 130 to the 200's at times. Herinsulin sliding scale should be tightened.Tube lines and drains: The patient has a trach , PEG , Foley , andabdominal VAC sponge , and peripheral IVs.CONSULTATIONS:Diabetes Medicine , Nutrition.COMPLICATIONS:None.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:1.

He originally presented with 2-3 weeks ofgeneralized weakness with intermittent chest pain and was diagnosed withsevere polymyositis ( CK up to 33 , 000 ) during last admission. He was givenIVF+bicarb for renal protection from myoglobinuria and became volumeoverloaded , with successful diuresis to euvolemia by the time ofdischarge. He had intermittent CP occurring at night , described asnonradiating over left chest associated with SOB. He had persistentlyelevated troponin with no ischemic changes on EKG , and his CP was felt tobe due to myocarditis. He was treated with ASA , labetalol , isordil ,CCB , and ativan with improvement. He was started on IV solumedrolwith immediate significant improvement in CK ( down to 10 , 000 ) andtroponin ( 0.64 ). During his 12 hour stay at rehab , he developed CPwith SOB occurring at night. He was then readmitted to TH for cardiaccatheterization and further care.****PMH: cocaine , EtOH abuse ( s/p ativan taper last admission ) , HTN ,colonic tubular adenoma , MS , AI****Pre-admission Medication List for BIANCUZZO , WAYNE 94184553 ( TSMC ) 66 1.ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID PO 325 MG QD2.

Chest pain and shortness of breath. He was re-admitted for nocturnalchest pain while at rehab , and concern for myocardial ischemia. Heunderwent cardiac catheterization that showed normal coronary anatomy ,suggesting that the elevated CK-MB and troponin were likely frommyocarditis , as previously suspected. Notably , his chest pain was oftenassociated with shortness of breath. It was noted on his prior admissionthat he had pleural effusions from the high volume diuresis intended toprotect his kidneys from myoglobin toxicity , however he had been diuresingwell to lasix. It was thought that his CP and SOB might be due to PND givenhis valvular disease. Consequently , his vasoldilatory medications wereswitched to evening dosing , his lasix dose increased , and the head of bedkept elevated at greater than thirty degrees. On the day after admission , hehad one episode of chest pain with shortness of breath , where he indicatedpain in his RUQ. A KUB was negative , as was a PE protocol CT , and heresponded very well to lasix. He had one further episode of SOB at night ,again responsive to lasix and position. He had a repeat echo that showedno progression of his valvular disease from prior admission and equivalentEF of 70-75%. He was maintained on aspirin , labetalol , diltiazem , imdur , andativan prn.2. Arrhythmias. He was on rate control with calcium channel blockers.He had several noctural few beat runs of NSVT , but no other significantevents.3. Rhabdo: He has severe polymyositis causing muscle weakness and elevatedCK , with possible contribution from cocaine. So far , the remaining work uphas been negative. Preliminary biopx sy shows muscle necrosis andchronic inflammation along with features reminiscent of dermatomyositis. Hewas changed back to IV solumedrol on admission , and switched to PO solumedrolon discharge. His CK dropped from 15 , 000 on this admission to 10 , 000 , andthen hovered around that dose. Rheumatology Consult Fellow Gavin Nordman feltthis was a normal pattern under treatment , and that the true extent ofrecovery/impairment will only be known in several weeks to months.diagnosis.4. Renal. His Cr was maintained at 1.3-1.5 over the course of his admission ,likely related to both renal damage from myoglobinuria and possibly fromover-diureses and pre-renal phsyiology , especially in the context of BUN of42. His lasix dose , initially increased on admission due to excellentsymptomatic response with diuresis , was in the process of slow tapering atthe time of discharge in attempt to identify the appropriate outpatientdosing , with goal of maximizing symptomatic resopnse and minimizing prerenalphysiology.5. FULL CODEADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Mr Water You were admitted for chest pain , and it was determined bylooking at the anatomy of the vessels supplying your heart that you havenot had a heart attack caused by diminished blood flow to the heart. Youdo , however , have an inflammatory condition in which your immune systemattacks and breaks down your muscle. As you know , the recovery processwill be long , and you will need to take medication for it for at leastfour to eight weeks. Your rheumatologist , Dr Zoelle , will coordinate yourmedication and care. You have an appointment with her in two weeks.Also , you have disease afflicting the valves of your heart , and you willneed to see a cardiologist. You have an appointment with Dr Kissi for thisissue. In addition , you have an appointment with your new primary carephysician , Dr Holverson . Please attend all of these appointments , and besure to take all your medications as prescribed. Lastly , it cannot beemphasized enough that your health depends on the care you take ofyourself , making sure to stop smoking , stop drinking alcohol , and stoptaking any illicit drugs.Please seek medical attention for difficulty breathing , worseningweakness , black or bloody stools , or any other concerns.DISCHARGE CONDITION: StableTO DO/PLAN:1. Myositis. Please follow CK , may need additional agent in the long term.Per Rheumatology , response may take weeks.2. Chest pain. His pain is NOT of ischemic origin. He does have rheumaticheart disease , and appears to have PND with pain and shortness of breaththat is responsive to lasix , position , and oxygen.3. Lasix dosing. He will need to be tapered on lasix , with attempt toidentify the proper dose for symptomatic relief while not making himpre-renal.No dictated summaryENTERED BY: WADDING , KIETH L. , M.D. ( AV66 ) 5/17/06 @ 01:07 PM****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******

His cardiac history began in 1980 , when hesuffered from an myocardial infarction and had a second myocardialinfarction in 1986. He had a 3 vessel coronary artery bypass graftin 1987 with a LIMA-left anterior descending , saphenous vein graftto OM and saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The patient developeddecreasing functional status postoperatively and recentechocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%.In October 2000 , Mr. Straight was admitted to the Luke's Medical Center with chief complaint of dyspnea on exertion andfatigue. Cardiac catheterization at that time showed native 3vessel disease with occlusion of his venous graft to his obtusemarginal and posterior descending arteries. On that admission , Mr.Etling was aggressively diuresed and post discharge , he was able tocomplete his normal activities of daily living with no shortness ofbreath or chest pain. Over the several months prior to admission ,however , Mr. Knoeppel noted progressive worsening of shortness ofbreath , dyspnea on exertion and fatigue , such that , on the day ofadmission , he reported that he could not walk from his driveway tohis house without symptoms. He reported no baseline orthopnea , butstates he does have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,history of gallstones , hypothyroidism ,nephrolithiasis , cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant only for the coronary arterybypass graft in 1987.FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of an myocardial infarction in his50s. His mother also died of an myocardialinfarction in her 70s.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Captopril 37.5 t.i.d. 2. Isordil30 t.i.d. 3. Digoxin .125 q. day. 4.Synthroid .25 q. day. 5. Lipitor 20 q. day. 6. Torsemide 80b.i.d. 7. Coumadin 4 mg Monday/Wednesday/Friday , 5 mg other days.8. NPH 40 units b.i.d.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 97 , pulse 69 ,blood pressure 100/70 , respiratory rate 16 ,satting 92% on room air. Neck examination revealed jugular venouspressure , elevated behind the ear and approximately 27 mm withpositive hepatojugular reflux. The lungs were clear toauscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular examination revealedregular rate and rhythm with frequent ectopy , positive S3 and PMIin the midaxillary line. Abdomen was benign. Extremities showedno lower extremity edema with 1+ distal pulses and warm to thetouch.LABORATORY DATA: Significant for a sodium of 146 , BUN 16 ,creatinine 1.3 , hematocrit 36 , INR 1.4.EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 67 with left axis deviation ,right bundle branch block and Q-waves in leads 2 , 3 and AVF.Chest x-ray revealed no pulmonary edema.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology Ohioservice for diuresis and possible inotropesupport. He was diuresed over the course of 10 days usingTorsemide 80 mg IV t.i.d. and his Captopril was gradually increasedas tolerated to a maximum dose of 75 mg t.i.d. The patientdiuresed without difficulty and by the time of discharge , he hadweighed a dry weight of approximately 96 kilograms.The patient was also evaluated for possible heart transplant.Work-up was extensive and included an echocardiogram on 11/20/01 ,which showed an ejection fraction of 15-20% with global hypokinesisand akinesis of the inferior septal walls with moderate mitralregurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Abdominalultrasound on 11/20/01 , revealed probable cardiac cirrhosis. Aliver spleen scan on 10/1/01 , was consistent with mild cardiaccirrhosis , as was an MRI of the liver on 4/24/01 .  As a result ,the patient was not considered a candidate for transplant.Pulmonary function tests on 4/10/01 , revealed a DLCO = 14 , whichwas 49% of expected. On 3/20/01 , the patient underwent adobutamine MIBI stress test that was consistent with a moderatelyenlarged area of prior myocardial infarction of the left circumflexterritory and posterior descending artery territories. Theexamination was also suggestive with an area of modest dobutamineinduced ischemia in the territory of the left anterior descendingwith preserved viability.Endocrine wise , the patient's diabetes was managed in-house on aregular insulin sliding scale. Because his hemoglobin A1C levelwas below 6 on discharge , he was placed back on his regiment of NPH40 units b.i.d. In terms of his thyroid , we made no adjustments tohis Levoxyl regiment. He has been coumadinized for a low ejectionfraction and was discharged on his regular regiment of 4 mgMonday/Wednesday/Friday and 5 mg on all other days.The patient also has a history of depression and he was maintainedon Prozac 20 mg q. day.Hematologically , the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 36during his hospitalization. His MCV = 75.1 in a 61-year-old malewith necrocytic anemia. We obtained a colonoscopy which revealedpolyps , all of which were snagged with no complications. Thepathologies are currently pending.The patient was discharged on 7/15/01 , having diuresed to a dryweight of 96 kilograms and plan to follow-up with Dr. Goltra on7/30/01 .Dictated By: ELDRIDGE SCHUSTERMAN , M.D. VY39Attending: STAN B.

HEART FAILURE.2. DIABETES MELLITUS.3. HISTORY OF CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT.4. ASTHMA.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year-old womanwith history of dilated cardiomyopathyand estimated ejection fraction of 35 to 40% who presented withlower extremity edema , weakness , fatigue , and syncopal episodes x2. At baseline the patient states that she is able to walk andperform her activities of daily living without symptoms of heartfailure. Per patient , about five days prior to admission , shebegan to notice increasing lower extremity edema , rapidly spreadingfrom her calves up to her thighs. She also noted symptoms ofweakness and fatigue. On 9/29/03 the patient reported two syncopalepisodes- the first of which was preceded by dizziness after whichshe lost consciousness after lying down. She awoke and walked toher apartment where she apparently lost consciousness a second timealthough she does not remember having any prodromal symptoms priorto the second episode. The patient was found by her neighbor andtaken to the Niry Hospital .  At Labi Straubll Hospital ,the patient was treated for heart failure with diuresis with IVLasix. An echocardiogram at the Malvfi Hospital showed an ejectionfraction of 10 to 15% , 4+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspidregurgitation. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction andECG showed no ischemic changes. The patient did have one run of11-beat non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Liver functiontests were noted to be elevated. Her hepatitis panel wasreportedly negative. The patient was transferred from Got Centerto Towhiddle Amentcon Pal Medical Center as her primary care physician andcardiologist are at Oten Memorial Hospital .PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypotension. History of cerebrovascularaccident. Type II diabetes mellitus.Asthma. Dilated cardiomyopathy.MEDICATIONS: On transfer , Albuterol inhaler , Flovent inhalers ,Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. ,Reglan 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals , Colace , iron , Captopril 50 mgp.o. t.i.d. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH 35 units q.a.m. andq.p.m. , Humalog sliding scale , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , andAlbuterol nebulizers p.r.n.LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 1.3. WBC normal. TSH was normal at2.1 , ESR 8. ECG showed sinus rhythm , left atrialenlargement , left ventricular hypertrophy , no ischemic changes.HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient has a dilatedcardiomyopathy and was admitted with volumeoverload. The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix throughout herhospital course with successful diuresis of 1 to 2 liters of fluidper day. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20 to25% , severe global hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , andmoderate tricuspid regurgitation. Right and left heartcatheterization was performed. The right heart catheterizationshowed the following: Right atrial pressure was 8 , rightventricular pressure 35/5 , PA pressure 37/17 , and wedge pressure of15. The left heart catheterization showed two vessel coronaryartery disease , no obstructive lesions. The patient showed markedclinical improvement with diuresis with IV Lasix. Prior todischarge the Lasix was changed from IV to p.o. and the patient wasstable on p.o. regimen of Lasix prior to discharge. The left heartcatheterization , as noted above showed moderate coronary arterydisease. The patient was continued on statin for this reason. Thepatient had had two syncopal episodes prior to admission along witha run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia at the outsidehospital. This raised the concern along with her low ejectionfraction that she could be having arrhythmias causing syncope. Ontelemetry during this admission , the patient was noted to haveadditional runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia along withan episode of complete heart block. The electrophysiology servicewas consulted and placed an ICD and pacer on 11/25/03 .  Thisprocedure was well tolerated.Renal: The patient was noted to have low albumin on admission andprotein in her urine , concerning for nephrotic syndrome. Renalconsult was obtained. The 24-hour urine was collected. Renalultrasound was negative for hydrosis or renal vein thrombosis. AnSPEP and UPEP were sent which are pending at the time of thisdictation. The renal consult felt that the diabetes mellitus wasthe likely explanation for the protein wasting in the urine. Thepatient was continued on an Ace inhibitor.Infectious disease: The patient was noted to have a localized areaof infection at the area of old IV site on admission. She wasstarted on p.o. dicloxacillin to treat this infection. Surgery wasconsulted and ruled out septic thrombophlebitis.Hematology: The patient was taken off Coumadin on admission butwas continued on heparin for anticoagulation. The Coumadin wasrestarted after the pacer and ICD were placed.Endocrine: The patient was treated on a regimen of Lentes andinsulin sliding scale. Her blood sugars were stable on thisregimen.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient will planned tobe discharged on the following medications:Dicloxacillin 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.hs. , Lentes 40units subcu q.hs. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , and Keflex 25 mg p.o. q.i.d.FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr.Avary . She will follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. Dobies , on3/3/03 .  She will have a repeat echocardiogram in July toreassess her ejection fraction and valvular disease.Dictated By: RODRICK J.

The patient was well untilFriday before admission when he drove 2 1/2 hours to Coln As Lasand he had some back stiffness. The following day the patientnoted back pain , took some Tylenol but remained "stiff all day".On the following day , Sunday , he appeared better , able to toleratewalking well. On Monday he again had severe pain , came to theemergency department here at Ux Erla A Hospital where hehad a CT of the spine and chest without evidence of abnormalities.He was discharged to home with Percocet. On the morning ofadmission the patient was again with pain. He was urged by hiscardiologist to come to the emergency department to rule outepidural abscess , work up for cause of back pain. He was negativefor any fever or chills. No bowel or bladder incontinence. Noradiation of pain down the legs.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except for HPI.PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.0 , heart rate 78 , bloodpressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 20 , satting 95% onroom air. GENERAL: The patient was sitting in the stretcher ,comfortable but with pain upon movement. HEENT: Pupils are equaland reactive to light. Mucous membranes moist. Oropharynx isclear. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm with a mechanicalS1 and S2. PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally withtrace bibasilar crackles. ABDOMEN: Obese , nontender ,nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Warm and wellperfused. 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Intact.Lower extremities limited by pain.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease statuspost coronary artery bypass grafting , statuspost myocardial infarction , mitral valve replacement with a St.Jude valve , congestive heart failure , history of endocarditis ,history of hypercholesterolemia , status post cholecystectomy.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Amiodarone 200 mg q day , digoxin 0.125mg q day , Imdur 30 mg q day , Captopril50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Toprol 50 mg q day , Lipitor 80 mg q day ,Coumadin 3 mg po q day , Levoxine 75 mg q day , Lasix p.r.n.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife.FAMILY HISTORY: Non-contributory.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Notable for a white blood cell countof 11.17 , hematocrit of 44.6 ,platelet count of 129 , with 27 lymphocytes , 55 neutrophils , D-dimer278.HOSPITAL COURSE: 67-year-old male with a history of mitral valvereplacement complaining of severe back pain withStreptococcus endocarditis in 2002 admitted of thoracic back painfor four days. The pain progressed to the point where the patienthad difficulty ambulating secondary to the pain. CT scan of thethoracic and lumbar spine on May , 2003 were negative forabscess. The patient had no fevers. His admission exam was benignwith no aortic insufficiency and normal neurological exam. Therewas variable pain to palpation over the ribs with no pain topalpation over the spine. The patient was managed conservativelywith Oxycodone , Motrin and Baclofen. He was initially admitted toGMS , and troponin was initially positive at 0.12 and then becamenegative.1. Infectious disease: Blood cultures drawn on March , 2003grew 2/2 bottles of gram positive cocci in clusters and pairs. Dueto concern for prosthetic valve endocarditis or potential epiduralabscess , the patient was transferred to cardiology. Infectiousdisease consult was obtained. Vancomycin and gentamicin werestarted on March , 2003. On October , 2003 a transesophagealechocardiogram was negative for vegetation. A MRI of the spine wasnegative for osteomyelitis , epidural abscess however the MRI didshow severe degenerative joint disease possibly causing thepatient's back pain. The patient has had numerous positive bloodcultures for Streptococcus sanguous ( Viridans group ) , bloodcultures were last positive on March , 2003 with a negative workup including a negative transthoracic echocardiogram and negativetransesophageal echocardiogram , negative chest CT x 2 , negativeabdominal CT ( which did show a small liver cyst ) , negative taggedwhite blood cell count scan and a negative back MRI. Dentalconsult saw no abscesses thus no evidence of a large septic sourcefrom the mouth although this particular bacteria raises suspicionfor an oral source. Repeat films and dental evaluation on November , 2003 required the patient to get teeth cleaning as anoutpatient. There is a question of some seeding from bleeding gumsthat occur about once weekly while the patient is brushing frompoor dentition and gum care. The dentist recommended deep cleaningas an outpatient with prophylactic antibiotics. the patient wasinitially started on gentamicin , vancomycin , on October , 2003switched to gentamicin and penicillin. He will complete a 2 weekcourse of gentamicin and penicillin G on November , 2003. At that timeon August , 2003 the patient should start a 4-week course ofceftriaxone 1 gram q day. PICC line was placed on August , 2003to provide long term access for antibiotics.2. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on Toprol , Imdur ,switched from Captopril to Lisinopril. Rhythm: The patient was onamniocentesis , digoxin , Coumadin for St. Jude valve and paroxysmalatrial fibrillation. CT and MRI is negative. Pain significantlyimproved on January , 2003. The patient was on Neurontin andOxyContin and oxycodone and Motrin , may benefit from restarting onBaclofen if pain not well controlled on this regimen or persistsoutside the treatment of endocarditis.3. Endocrine: Continue on Synthroid.DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: Insurance does not cover homeantibiotics so the patient will bedischarged to a skilled nursing facility for intravenousantibiotics likely to the O Hospital on August ,2003.TO DO PLAN:1. Follow the patient's INR closely while on Motrin andantibiotics , in the past when on antibiotics his INR has beendifficult to control , goal range for the patient should bearound 2.8 to 3.5 and his Coumadin was increased from 3-4 mgon August , 2003 given that his INR was trending downward to2.0 on January , 2003.2.

Also may have gastritis or pancreatitis. Right upperquadrant pain may be secondary to congestive heart failure.3. History of hypothyroidism. Check TSH.HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiomyopathy service , Dr. Jim Gerardot ,attending , began following patient on the firsthospital day. It was felt that the Lasix drip was ineffective andrecommended starting 200 mg IV Lasix t.i.d. with the goal ofkeeping the patient 1.5 to 2.5 liters negative per day. Thepatient had difficulty with repletion of potassium during theentire hospital stay. Patient does not tolerate well either theimmediate release oral form of potassium or the IV form. The IVform hurts the IV site and the oral form makes him nauseous , but hestill prefers the oral form. Over the course of the admission , 10mg p.o. twice daily of slow released potassium was started and ,eventually , was 30 mg twice daily at the end of his stay.Captopril was added to the regimen at 12.5 mg three times a day onthe second hospital day and was eventually raised to 50 mg threetimes a day as his blood pressure tolerated , which took four days.Creatinine remained stable throughout admission and did not affectour ability to diurese with Lasix. After six days , the patient wasadequately diuresed. JVP was now not visible. Lungs were clear.There was no edema. The patient is tolerating captopril well.Coumadin , which had been 4 mg per day on admission , was cut to 2 mgper day because of the high INR on admission. Two days prior todischarge , INR fell to 1.9. Patient was restarted on 4 mg per day.At discharge , INR was 1.7. Patient does not wish to stay to haveINR corrected. VNA has been arranged to administer Lovenox and tocheck PT , PTT over the next few days until this normalizes to atherapeutic level.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.125mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.d. , Compazine 10mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea.Patient is being discharged home with VNA services.

He was also statuspost ICD placement in 2001. At baseline , he has a one staircaseexercise tolerance before becoming short of breath. He alsoadmits that he has been having increasing orthopnea andparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He denies , chest pain ,palpitations , or peripheral edema. He also has a history ofdietary fluid intake and medications noncompliance leading toheart failure exacerbations. Currently , he states that he hasbeen eating "salty foods , " and has been drinking a lot of extrafluids because he has been feeling dry and is not always takinghis medications. Consequently , he has noticed a worsening in hisexercise tolerance , worsening orthopnea , and most notably anincrease in abdominal girth. Because of these symptomsconsistent with decompensated heart failure , his physicianssuggested that he be admitted to the hospital for management ofhis decompensated heart failure. Of note , he has been previouslyon a transplant list , but has been delisted given hisnoncompliance and continuation of tobacco use.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:In addition to the cardiomyopathy is chronic renal insufficiencywith the creatinine ranging from 1.2 to 3.5 at times.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Aldactone 25 mg once a day , K-Dur 40 mEq once a day , lisinopril2.5 mg once a day , Isordil 20 mg three times a day , digoxin 0.125once a day , torsemide 200 mg twice , and metolazone p.r.n. forvolume overload.SOCIAL HISTORY:As mentioned , he is smoking one-half per day of cigarettes ,occasional alcohol use , no IV drug use.FAMILY HISTORY:His mother , his brother , and his cousin and nephew all have thefamilial cardiomyopathy.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:On the day of admission , he presented with the JVP in the 18 to20 range on the physical examination with positive HJR. Hiscardiac exam had a positive S3 of laterally displaced PMI withthe right ventricular heave. He also had a 2/6 systolic murmur.His abdomen was distended , nontender , but likely with ascites andpalpable liver edge. His extremities were warm without edema.HOSPITAL COURSE:From the cardiac standpoint , we initially attempted to diuresehim IV torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. However , he did not respond wellenough to this regimen , and therefore we started drip withZaroxolyn p.r.n. We also stopped his Isordil and ACE inhibitorearly on because of blood pressures in the 80s. On admission ,his creatinine was 2.0 and on the next day of admission , it was2.2 with low blood pressures , at which point , we decided to starta low-dose dopamine drips at 2 mcg per hour. However , his urineoutput was only about 500 cc negative , so we further increasedthe Lasix drip from 10 mg an hour to 20 mg an hour after 200 mgIV Lasix bolus. On this combination of the Lasix drip at 20 anhour and dopamine at 2 mcg per hour , he began to have very goodand effective urine output at approximately 2-3 liters per day ,negative , also reflected in his total weight , and came in withadmission weight of around 90 kg. On each day , he diuresed aboutan half to kilo off until the day of discharge , at which point ,he was less than 86 kg. We monitored strict I's and O's , checkeddaily weight. During the course of his diuresis , his sodiumlevels were decreasing mostly secondary to the patient drinking alot of free water. The combination of free water intake in thesetting of natriuresis resulted in further worsening of hishyponatremia from an admission sodium of 128 to 124 , eventuallyto 122. We strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intaketo less than 2 liters per day , and at that point , his sodiumlevels than rebounded to 124 and also 128 on the day ofdischarge. We monitored the b.i.d. lytes. Eventually , his bloodpressures remained stable. His JVP decreased from 18 to 20 onadmission to about 10 to 12 and continued to have good urineoutput , thus we weaned off the dopamine , but continued the Lasixdrip for one more day. We then discontinued the Lasix drip andtransitioned him back over to torsemide 200 b.i.d. p.o. , whichwas his home regimen and watch him for another 24 hours. Hecontinued to diurese at this dose , but then on the day ofdischarge , his I's and O's were finally about 500 cc negative ,which is a change from about 1 to 2 liters negative per day. HisJVP was about 9 to 10 and his creatinine was stable at 1.7. Were-added his Isordil at 10 mg t.i.d. for the last 24 hours andhis blood pressures were stable in the 90s. Given his potassium ,which was always borderline low in the 33 or 35 range , we decidedto increase his Aldactone dose to 25 mg b.i.d. , but given hisunderlying renal insufficiency , we have decreased his standingK-Dur from 40 mEq a day to 20 mEq a day. An echo was done , whichshowed an ejection fraction of 20% and 4+ MR. They did notcomment on the synchrony on the preliminary report. However , heis a candidate for Bi-V pacing given his mildly widened QRScomplex stage III heart failure and having been on a very goodheart failure regimen up until this point.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:At discharge , his medical regimen consisted of digoxin 0.125 mgonce a day , torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. , Aldactone 25 mg b.i.d. ,Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and K-Dur 20 mEq. We also added folate 5mg to his regimen because he had an elevated homocystine level.He also takes Ambien at night p.r.n. for insomnia.DISPOSITION:He is being discharged to home with plan to follow up with Dr.Grassi in her Thyroid Clinic on 3/1/05 .  He has been again urgedto stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because heis a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , heis not listed given the aforementioned reasons. Overall , Mr.Plagmann states that his symptoms have drastically improved. Heno longer has orthopnea. He is able to exert himself much morewithout symptoms of shortness of breath or lightheadedness , andhe is eager to go homeeScription document: 1-0474396 EMSSten TelDictated By: BURK , MARIANOAttending: MIRICLE , BRENDANDictation ID 5597826D: 6/19/04T: 6/19/04

In 1992 he had unstableangina , and catheterization showed that the distal grafts weretotally occluded. He had a redo coronary artery bypass graft withsaphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and theleft circumflex , his postoperative course being complicated byatrial fibrillation. In 1996 , he had a non-Q wave myocardialinfarction with a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ofthe saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one , and saphenous veingraft to the posterior descending artery. In 1997 , he had a repeatpercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with an saphenousvein graft to the diagonal one , and an saphenous vein graft to theposterior descending artery. Most recently he was admitted inOctober of 1999 with an exercise tolerance test mibi , for whichexercise for four minutes and seven seconds he had inferolateralischemia. Echocardiogram showed an left ventricular ejectionfraction of 50 percent , anterior inferior posterior hypokinesis , 1to 2+ mitral regurgitation , pulmonary artery systolic pressure of42.0 millimeters of mercury plus right atrial pressure of 6.Catheterization showed 100 percent occlusion of his saphenous veingraft to the diagonal one , which was stented. His right coronaryartery and diagonal one were totally occluded. His left anteriordescending artery was 95 percent. His left circumflex was clear.At that time he was randomized to the Airssylv Medical Center trial. At baseline ,Mr. Dodwell denies exertional chest pain or any angina. He does getshort of breath with one flight of stairs , or going uphill for oneblock. He gets claudication after walking three house lots.He was in his usual state of health until one day prior toadmission when he noted the onset of 4/10 aching chest , shoulder ,and left arm pain while watching television , and it was associatedwith shortness of breath.

He is a retired machinist andlives with his wife of 53 years.FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of a myocardial infarction at 77.His sister had a coronary artery bypass graft at 70. He has manybrother , one of whom is 71 who had a myocardial infarction at 44 ,and one who had a coronary artery bypass graft at 70.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination in general , he is apleasant elderly man in no apparent distress. His vital signs , hisheart rate was 96 , blood pressure 174/64 , saturating 95 percent onroom air. He had carotid bruits bilaterally. His lungs wereclear. His jugular venous pressure was less than 5.0 centimeters.His PMI was nonpalpable. He had a regular rate with a 1/6 systolicejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without radiation.Extremities , he had a left femoral thrill and bilateral femoralbruits. He had 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. Hisextremities were warm without edema. His neurologic examinationwas non-focal.LABORATORY DATA: His labs on admission were significant for a BUNand creatinine of 49 and 1.3 , hematocrit of 40.5. His urinalysiswas normal. Electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia at 53 , leftaxis deviation , right bundle branch block , no hypertrophy , no Q ,new T wave inversion in V4 through V6. Chest x-ray was clear. HisTroponin was 0.45 , CK was 197 , his myoglobin was 159 , his INR was1.5.HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 73-year-old man withextensive coronary artery disease , who presents with one day of histypical anginal pain , multiple bruits , new lateral T waveinversions , admitted for a rule out myocardial infarction. Hishospital course by issue:1. Cardiovascular: Mr. Jinkerson was catheterized on the evening ofadmission , and he was found to have the following. He was found tohave a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one was 100 percentoccluded. Saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending arterywas open. His left main was 30 percent occluded. His leftanterior descending artery was 99 percent occluded. His diagonalone was 100 percent occluded. His left circumflex was 80 percentoccluded. His left subclavian which was supplying his leftinternal mammary artery was 100 percent occluded. He was takenback to the Catheterization Laboratory the next day with Dr.Devincenzo who performed a left subclavian artery stent and also aleft brachial artery angioplasty. Mr. Maheu tolerated thisprocedure well. He had no return of his chest pain after theprocedure , and his pulses remained normal , he had no groinhematoma. He was placed on Plavix. He also continued his aspirin ,and his Coumadin was restarted after the heparin and intravenousTNG which were originally put on board to prevent arterial spasmafter the procedure , were discontinued. His next cardiovascularissue was his blood pressure. He was originally on atenolol 25milligrams q.d. , we added back Cozaar 25 milligrams q.d. which hehad been on before admission and had been stopped a month priorbecause he had low blood pressure with a systolic in the 80s.However , his first day here , his systolic pressure was 120 to 130 ,and restarted it. He had no problems with that. His bloodpressure a few days after admission was in the 150 to 160 systolicover 70 , and amlodipine was added to his regimen. He was continuedon his outpatient doses of Lasix 160 milligrams q.a.m. andmitozalone 5 q.d. He ruled out for a myocardial infarction.2. Renal: After the first catheterization , Mr. Ong creatininewent from 1.3 to 1.8. However , it went back to 1.3 the next day.After the second catheterization it went up to a peak of 4.3.However , his urine output remained at 100 to 150 cc an hour withLasix 100 milligrams intravenous p.r.n. , in addition to his morningdose of 160 milligrams q.a.m. , and he was given normal salineintravenous fluids to equalize his ins and outs. He did not haveany signs of cholesterol emboli , no levator reticularis , noeosinophilia , no blue toes.3. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: He had a low potassium on themorning of admission with a potassium of 2.7 because he had missedhis outpatient K-Dur of 60 mEq q.d. He had no symptoms , he had noelectrocardiogram changes. He was repleted throughout admissionand was kept on his outpatient dose of K-Dur and had no problemsfurther with potassium. In addition , he was discharged on astanding dose of magnesium because his magnesium was routinely lowthroughout admission , on the order of 1.5 to 1.8.4. Hematology: On the day after his catheterization , hishematocrit dropped from 33.0 to 28.0. He was transfused two unitswith an appropriate bump back to 33.0. He tolerated this withoutany problems.5. Diabetes: He was maintained on his outpatient regimen of NPH30/10 and 4 regular q.p.m. , and Rezulin. His blood sugars weremaintained throughout admission.6. Genitourinary: He was maintained on his finasteride for benignprostatic hypertrophy. In addition , he had a biopsy prior toadmission which had shown chronic prostatitis. His outpatienturologist had recommended ciprofloxacin 500 milligrams b.i.d. forthirty days. Since the hospital does not carry ciprofloxacin , weput him on Levofloxacin 500 milligrams q.d.

He had awhite count of 14.2 with a hematocrit of 42.9 and platelets of 222.His triglycerides were elevated at 303 , and his cholesterol waselevated at 265 with an HDL fraction of 32 and an LDL fraction of172. His prothrombin time was 11.3 , partial thromboplastin time28.4 , and INR 0.85. Urinalysis was negative. An electrocardiogramwas performed at the time of admission which showed resolution ofthe ST elevations. He had T wave inversions in V2 through V4 , andflat T waves in V5 through V6.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Myocardial Infarction: He wascontinued on a heparin drip , Lopressor , and lisinopril. Hisdigoxin was discontinued at the time of admission. Nitroglycerinwas given only p.r.n. He remained symptom-free throughout hishospitalization. His elevated cholesterol was treated. Heunderwent cardiac catheterization on July , 1998 which showed 50percent left main obstruction and 90 percent complex mid leftanterior descending. His right coronary artery was occluded. Thepatient did well both during and after the catheterization. Thepatient underwent a stress mibi test with a viability study on January , 1998 which showed ischemia during his exercise tolerance test.The mibi showed severe ischemia in 11/25 segments , as well as aninfarct on the apical septum , apex , and base of the inferior wall.Options were considered including coronary artery bypass graftingand angioplasty. After a long discussion with the CardiologyService , Cardiac Surgery , the Renal Service and the patient , thedecision was made to proceed with angioplasty. On July , 1998 ,the patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronaryangioplasty of his right coronary artery with zero percent residualblockage. He also had two stents into his left anterior descendingwith zero percent residual blockage. The patient tolerated theprocedure well.2. Renal: The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma forwhich he underwent a nephrectomy in 1994. He also has chronicrenal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy. As surgery was beingconsidered for his cardiac disease , a Renal consultation wasobtained to evaluate his renal status. He underwent a renalultrasound showing an exophytic mass in his solitary kidney. Thiswas very concerning for recurrence of carcinoma. He then underwentan MRI study which showed a nonenhancing mass in the kidney whichwas most consistent with a hyperdense , proteinaceous cyst. Thiswas reassuring , though cancer could not be ruled out 100 percent.The patient's renal function remained stable throughout hishospitalization.3. Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient wasplaced on an insulin sliding scale during his hospitalization. Hewas instructed to continue with his Glyburide , and to follow-up asusual with his outpatient provider.The patient was discharged to home on October , 1998 , one dayfollowing his second catheterization procedure. The patient didvery well following the procedure , and had remained pain anddyspnea-free.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mgp.o. q.d. 2. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Lopressor 12.5 mgp.o. three times per day. 4. Nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingualtablets , one sublingually every five minutes x three as needed forchest pain. 5. Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6. Lipitor 10 mg p.o.q.h.s. 7. Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8. Ticlid 250 mg p.o.b.i.d.FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with hisprimary care physician , and to call the office to schedule anappointment. The necessary follow-up with Cardiology and with thenephrologist will be scheduled as an outpatient.Dictated By: CEDRIC BONGERS , M.D. TT96Attending: TY O.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.3. URINARY TRACT INFECTION.4. DIABETES MELLITUS.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70-year-old woman whowas followed in cardiology byDr. Pikula who has presumed diastolic dysfunction , who was in herusual state of health until 1/23 , when she was admitted to the Dobubay Naicent University Of Medical Center with a flare of Crohn's ileitis.At the time of her discharge , she was not restarted on her Lasixand subsequently developed fluid retention with gradual worsening ,shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. The patient noted a20 lb weight gain during this period , as well as increasingorthopnea and increasing dyspnea on exertion when getting dressedor doing any different movements. She was seen in cardiologyclinic on 8/3/02 and found to be in much worse congestive heartfailure with new atrial fibrillation. She was transferred then tothe emergency department here at the Peresvillee Nawvine University Of Hospitals And Clinics .Her most recent echocardiogram on 4/29/01 revealed mild tomoderate left ventricular hypertrophy without any regional wallmotion abnormalities. Her systolic ejection fraction was estimatedto be 60% suggesting a diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction and heartfailure. She was admitted with volume overload for diuresis.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The review of symptoms was notable for chesttightness with occasional palpitations. Sheexperienced no dizziness , no syncope and no recent diarrhea , noabdominal pain , no nausea or vomiting. She did report chronicarthritis.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Significant for congestive heart failuredue to diastolic dysfunction , ( 2 ) Crohn'scolitis diagnosed in 1963 , ( 3 ) Right breast carcinoma stage IIpreviously treated , not currently active , ( 4 ) Diabetes mellitus ,( 5 ) Obstructive sleep apnea , ( 6 ) Gastroesophageal reflux disease ,( 7 ) Hypercholesterolemia , ( 8 ) Osteoarthritis.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a prior tobacco smoker , havingsmoked two packs per day for 38 years , but hasquit. She does not drink alcohol and does not use any recreationaldrugs. The patient lives in Di with a friend and is a retiredx-ray technician.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.ALLERGIES: The patient's medical allergies include penicillin ,which causes a rash , Demerol and Dilaudid causingnausea , and Macrodantin.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Included a temperature of 97 ,heart rate 76 , blood pressure 90/60 ,respiratory rate 28 , and a saturation of 97% on room air. Thepatient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation. GENERAL: Physicalexamination showed that the patient was alert and oriented x3 , inno acute distress , having shortness of breath while sitting up inbed. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , andreactive , extraocular movements were intact. NECK: Showed jugularvenous distention to at least 20 cm. CHEST: Showed cracklesposteriorly approximately half of the way up. CARDIOVASCULAR:Showed an irregular rhythm and a systolic ejection murmurconsistent with the prior diagnosis of aortic stenosis. ABDOMEN:Showed profound obesity. EXTREMITIES: Showed significant pittingedema bilaterally over the calves.LABORATORY DATA: Showed a white blood cell count of 7 , hematocrit31 , platelets of 148. Sodium was 142 , potassium3.9 , BUN 56 , creatinine 1.3 , with a glucose of 75. Liver functiontests were normal. CK was 44 and troponin was 0.02. A chest x-rayshowed mild pulmonary vascular congestion without any evidence ofinfiltrates. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 72 ,otherwise no abnormalities beside some nonspecific ST-T wavechanges. Urinalysis showed evidence of an urinary tract infectionwith 20-30 white blood cells and was leukocyte esterase positive.Urine culture was sent at that time.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Congestive heart failure - The patient wasstarted on IV Lasix along with Zaroxolyn andresponded with a brisk diuresis over the course of the admission.The patient's weight declined by approximately 5.2 kg. It wasestimated that the total volume of fluid removed was approximately15 liters. The patient was reported great improvement in hersymptoms , was able to ambulate without requiring supplementaloxygen. The patient was switched to oral Lasix and continued herdiuresis. The day prior to discharge , the patient was switched tooral torsemide , and she will be discharged on that medication.2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient was noted to have new onsetof atrial fibrillation while being seen in cardiology clinic on8/3/02 . Since it was not known how long the atrial fibrillationhad been going on , a decision was made to anticoagulate thepatient. She was initially started on intravenous unfractionatedheparin while starting anticoagulation with Coumadin. The patientreached a therapeutic INR of 2.5 within approximately 4-5 days andthe IV heparin was discontinued. At the time of discharge , thepatient INR was 3.2. She will have INR follow up through herprimary cardiologist , Dr. Janousek . Currently , the decision tocardiovert the patient is left in the hands of her outpatientcardiologist.3. Urinary tract infection - The patient's initial urinalysisindicated a bacterial urinary tract infection. Subsequent urineculture grew out E. coli , which was subsequently determined to beresistant to levofloxacin. Initially , the patient had been startedon IV levofloxacin , which was subsequently changed to p.o.cefixime. The patient completed a five-day course of p.o. cefiximewhile here in the hospital and was discharged on that medicine tocomplete a 10-day course.

He was brought up onepinephrine , milrinone , dopamine , vasopressin , insulin , andpropofol drips.ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Neuro: The patient was extubated early on postop day 1 andpropofol was turned off on arrival to the ICU. The patient wasgiven Dilaudid IV initially for pain , converted to p.o. Dilaudid.He was also started on Zoloft on postop day 2 at 75 mg p.o.daily for his anxiety. He is relatively anxious but his pain hasbeen well controlled with Dilaudid. He will leave the ICU onDilaudid p.o. p.r.n. pain.2. Cardiovascular: The patient was brought up from theoperating room on epinephrine , milrinone , dopamine , andvasopressin drips. All drips were continued from postop day 1 topostop day 2. The patient's cardiac output and index were stableand his next venous saturations were stable in the 70s on thiscombination. Epinephrine was weaned slowly from postop days 2-3.It was off by postop day 4. Dopamine and vasopressin were alsoweaned from postop day 4-5. Hemodynamics remained stable.Milrinone was decreased to 0.4 from 0.5 on postop day 6. Thepatient will leave the ICU on postop day 6 and milrinone per Dr.Kridler will be weaned at 0.1 per day. The patient has beenhemodynamically stable from a cardiovascular standpoint sincearrival from the operating room. He was started on aspirin 81daily. Swan was removed prior to discharge from the intensivecare unit on postop day 5 , 11/4/05 .3. Pulmonary: The patient was extubated early on postop day 1without complications. The patient remained very wet secondaryto the amount of fluid and products he received in the operatingroom. The patient was started on a Lasix drip on postop day 1 ,which was continued for a goal urine output of 200 to 300 cc anhours. Patient with negative 3-4 liters in 24 hours over thepostop days 2-5. Lasix was discontinued on postop day 5 prior totransfer from the ICU as patient had been diuresing a largeamount and creatinine had risen slightly up to 2.1 from 1.5preoperatively. Urine output will continue to be monitored witha goal of negative overall fluid balance , as patient remains weton chest x-ray.4. GI: The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated. He iscurrently eating a regular low-fat , low-cholesterol diet and ison Nexium. He also remains on vitamins , folate , Colace , andlactulose. He has still not had a bowel movement prior todischarge from the intensive care unit.5. Renal: The patient was aggressively diuresed beginning onpostop day 1 with a Lasix drip. The Lasix drip was adjusted fora goal urine output of 200 to 300 cc an hour for several days.Drip was turned off on postop day 4 for a short period and againon postop day 5 as urine output remained stable at greater than200 an hour. Lasix drip is off on postop day 5 prior to transferfrom the intensive care unit. The patient will continue to needdiuresis since he is still wet on chest x-ray. The patient'screatine has bumped , however , from 1.5 to 2.1 at this point.6. Endocrine: The patient was weaned from his insulin drip onpostop day 5. He was continued on the Portland protocol duringhis time in the ICU as sugars were greater than 150. The patientwas started on postop day 2 on prednisone 35 p.o. b.i.d. , Neoral75 mg p.o. b.i.d. , which was since increased to 100. At the timeof discharge , patient remained on prednisone 35 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,Neoral 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and CellCept 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. perthe transplant team. Cyclosporin levels were followed and doseswere adjusted as needed.7. Heme: The patient was started on aspirin beginning on postopday 1. Aspirin is 81 mg p.o. daily.8. ID: The patient received vancomycin for his chest tubeprophylaxis. Chest tubes removed on 7/18/05 , postop day 4.Vanco was discontinued after this. Bactrim was also started onpostop day 1 for PCP prophylaxis and Valcyte was started severaldays later as the donor heart was CMV positive.Additional discharge medications and instructions will bedictated by the PA on the floor when the patient is dischargehome.eScription document: 3-7012582 VFFocus transcriptionistsDictated By: ILIFFE , VINCEAttending: BRECKENRIDGE , VERNON ANGELODictation ID 4117723D: 5/24/05T: 5/24/05

He has a history of medical nonadherence ,noncompliance. The patient presented four days prior to admissionon 10 of February to his primary care physician Dr. Dubrey with a coughchills , but no fever , myalgias , pleuritic chest pain and weightloss of 9 lb , from 167 to 158 in three months with increasedparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient had not been taking hiscongestive heart failure/cardiac medications for at least one week.A chest x-ray at that time was negative for pneumonia but wassuggestive congestive heart failure. He was also diagnosed with aprobably URI. His congestive heart failure medications wererefilled. A PPD was placed at that time. The patient was notgetting antibiotics.The patient developed progressive malaise , anorexia , was unable toget out of bed , poor p.o. He denied any increased alcohol abuse atthat time. There was no abdominal pain per the patient'sgirlfriend but there were complaints that the patient's mentalstatus was worsening. He was more lethargic and was found mumblingby his girlfriend with increased shortness of breath and EMTs werecalled who found the patient to be somewhat somnolent but arousablewith a blood glucose of 483 , blood pressure 110 /palp.

The patient lives with hisgirlfriend and "step-daughter" in Montesonnixcape Broke SonpoFAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease and alsopositive for diabetes mellitus in his sister andmother and his mother also "cancer".PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs - Temperature 94.0 , pulse 78 ,and regular , blood pressure 100/66 , O2 is100% saturation on 100% facemask. Respiratory rate 28. Ingeneral , the patient was responsive to voice and oriented toEn Hospital , and said 1997. Head , eyes , ears ,nose and throat exam showed that he was anicteric. Extraocularmovements are intact. Pupils are equal , round , reactive to light , 2mm. Oropharynx was dry. There was no jugular venous distentionand low lymphadenopathy. The neck was supple. Lungs - Had fewbibasilar crackles , greater on the right. Cardiovascular - Regularrate and rhythm with positive ectopy , no murmur , regurg or gallop.His abdomen was soft , diffusely tender , mildly distended withpositive bowel sounds with no liver edge palpated. He was hemenegative in the emergency room with no rebound. Extremities -Trace edema bilaterally and were somewhat cool. His skin had nopetechiae , no rash and no splinters. Neurological - He was able tomove all extremities. His reflexes were 2 in the upper and lowerextremities except for the left ankle which was 1 and his rightankle was 0. His left toe was downgoing. His right toe wasequivocal.LABORATORY DATA: Significant for a WBC of 11 , hematocrit wasnormal at 43 , platelets 160. Significant forbandemia of 14 , 81 polys , INR 1.3 , SMA-7 was significant for aserum sodium of 129 , potassium 7.6 , chloride of 91 , bicarb of 11 ,BUN of 178 creatinine of 7.5 , glucose of 1800. His CK was 126 ,troponion-I was 0. Lipase was 22 , 610 , amylase was 2840. Liverfunction tests were within normal limits , ALT of 11 , AST of 10 , LDH174 , alk phos of 11 , T-bili of 0.4 , albumin of 3.5 , calcium 9.3.Phos was elevated at 12.8 , magnesium was elevated at 5.2. UA was19.5.ACETEST was positive. A betahydroxybutyrate was 1.66. Digoxinlevel was 0.8 , tox screen was negative. UA - had 0-1 wbcs , SG of1.023.EKG showed ventricular pacing at a rate of 77.Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrates or effusions.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical IntensiveCare Unit for further treatment evaluation of hissevere metabolic abnormalities. He also by labs he had asignificant severe pancreatitis and was felt to be either a DKA orHHNKA. An endocrine consult was obtained and they felt that thepatient was likely not in DKA as the patient's level ofbetahydroxybutyrate of 1.66 was not enought to explain thepatient's gap or all his metabolic disturbances. The endocrineservice that more likely the patient had hyperglycemic ,hyperosmolar , nonketotic acidosis and also severe pancreatitis.Initial screens for the cause of pancreatitis were negativeincluding stones. The patient has significant alcohol history andhas been drinking alcohol which is the most likely cause of hissevere pancreatic insufficiency. The patient was aggressivelyhydrated with IV fluids and his metabolic abnormalities began tocorrect. He was also noted by labs to be in acute renal failureand a renal consult was obtained. The patient's nonoliguric renalfailure was in the setting of severe dehydration secondary tohyperosmolar state and ACE inhibitors were felt most likely due toATN. A renal ultrasound performed on 1 of July showed no evidence ofgallstones or biliary duct dilatation.An abdominal CT performed on 7 of July showed grade I pancreatitis withno evidence of a pseudocyst. The patient's clinical course wascomplicated by rhabdomyolysis which was felt to be due to ahypophosphatemic state , but this was not completely clear as thepatient's CKs began to rise while the patient's phosphate was stillsecondary to the acute renal failure. The patient's CKs peakedaround 10 , 000 and then began to fall steadily and the patient'srenal function with continued hydration improved steadily as hiscreatinine and BUN returned to normal. However , in the night of20 of June the patient's abdominal pain worsened and there was aquestion of peritoneal signs which prompted an emergent exploratorylaparotomy to rule out abdominal ischemia. However , the findingswere not consistent with ischemic bowel , but only severepancreatitis was noted. On 25 of July and 20 of June the patient did very wellpostoperatively back in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. He wasstarted on TPN and with a slow wean of his of dextrose , his bloodsugars normalized. On 20 of June the patient's renal function had alsonormalized. The patient by 5 of September had marked decreased abdominalpain , normalized electrolytes and his renal function was at hisbaseline with a creatinine of 1.0.The patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unitto our service on 8 of May on TPN and the following medications:1. Digoxin 0.375 mg q.d.2. Carafate one gram b.i.d.3. Albuterol two puffs t.i.d.4. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.He is also on TPN , but was being advanced to a clear liquid dietand seemed to be tolerating it well. He also continued to requirea large amount of insulin through his TPN and also through hissliding scale. The patient did well and was able to tolerate aclear liquid diet and was advanced in the next two days to a soft ,solid diet with very low fat.I will dictate the rest of the patient's events , assessment andplan by problem list as follows:1. GI:I. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient was able to be advancedto a soft solid diet for the past few days. She has abdominal painwhich had almost resolved and then resumed and the patientdeveloped a watery diarrhea. It was felt that this could be due topancreatic insufficiency versus C. diff colitis and therefore C.diff samples were sent and the patient was presumptively started onFlagyl and Pancrease 12 , 000 units t.i.d. 1/2 hour before meals.The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea persisted. This promptedus to make the patient n.p.o. once more and another abdominal CTwas obtained. An abdominal CT performed on 30 of March showedprogression of pancreatitis with increase inflammatory changes.There was no necrosis or pseudocyst formation noted. Also notedwas some significant small bowel dilatation without any evidence ofobstruction. Therefore , the patient was continued to be keptn.p.o. and TPN was restarted on 25 of April .  The patient has toleratedthis well and at this time has no longer had any abdominal paineither subjectively or on exam. It does occasionally have mild lowback pain which is thought to actually be due to his pancreatitisas opposed to any musculoskeletal cause.II. DIARRHEA: The patient also had diarrhea as noted above.He has been worked up extensively. His diarrhea has now resolved.He was C. diff negative , but was treated presumptively with Flagylfor seven days. All stool studies including Shigella , Salmonella ,Campylobacter , ova and parasites , Microsporidia have been negative.His stool has been sent for quantitative fecal fast which is stillpending on discharge. He has been repeatedly guaiac negative. Asnoted above his diarrhea has resolved.III. RESOLVED HEME POSITIVITY: The patient earlier in thecourse of his Intensive Care Unit stay had some stools that wereheme positive. They were thought to be due to gastritis. He hasnow been on initially , after that has been on Prilosec and nowchanged over to ranitidine in his TPN and has had multiple guaiacnegative stools in the past ten days.IV. SMALL PERIANAL ULCER: The patient was noted to have asmall perianal ulcer. It is felt to be secondary to pressure fromlying in bed and also secondary to his multiple episodes ofdiarrhea which had been going on for days. It is felt that thisshould resolve. If it does not , it is suggested that the ulcer beswabbed and sent for HSV.2. ENDOCRINE:I. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS: Due to the patient'spancreatic insufficiency , the patient will be a life long diabetic.The patient has been followed by the endocrine service and is nowreceiving 45 units of insulin per liter through his TPN. He isalso on a sliding scale regular regimen with finger stick q6h. Itis felt that this should be a relatively stable regimen for him atthis time. As the patient is weaned off his TPN and starts to takep.o. again , he should be switched over to NPH b.i.d. with regularinsulin checks on a sliding scale before his meals. The patientalso has a follow-up appointment with the diabetes clinic in threeweeks as noted below.3. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient does have a history of congestiveheart failure and has had mild bi-basilar crackles throughout hisstay here. This has not limited him in any way. He has had a goodoxygen saturations. The patient continues to take 40 mg of Lasixp.o. q.d. On the day of discharge , he received an extra 20 mg IVas he has been I&Os positive for the last few days and we noted aslightly more crackles on his exam. Of note , the patient has along history of having paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but had beendoing relatively well here. His current medical regimen includesIsordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. Both ofthese can be titrated upwards as his blood pressure allows. He hashad some labile blood pressures ranging anywhere from the systolicsof 80s to 130s while in the hospital and he has never beensymptomatic and even when he has been , he has had blood pressuresin the 80s and has tolerated this well. He is also maintained ondigoxin 0.375 mg q.d. He is also taking aspirin for his cardiacregimen.4. PULMONARY: The patient had good O2 saturations and usuallyranging from 95 to 97% on room air and has had no pulmonaryproblems. He has had bibasilar crackles on exam which is felt tobe due to some mild congestive heart failure for which he is takingLasix. He may need some extra doses of Lasix per your directionsthe next few days.5. HEME: The patient's hematocrit has been low in the high 20s ontwo occasions. In both cases always drifting down slowly thoughtto be due to delutional effects plus repeat a phlebotomy. He hasbeen transfused a total of three units while he has been in thehospital here. Otherwise is hematocrit has been stable formultiple days so has his platelets. Also of note the patient hasbeen heme negative from below for more than ten days.6. RENAL: The patient says his baseline creatinine in which hisacute renal failure has resolved.7. RHABDOMYOLYSIS: This has also resolved with the patient's CKshaving normalized over a week ago.8. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The patient has remained afebrile , normalwhite count for many days. While here he was also presumptivelytreated for C. diff which was actually found to be negative on hisstool examinations with no fecal leukocytes. The patient'stemperature curve should be followed given that the patientcontinues to have pancreatitis and is at risk for developing aphlegmon.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:1. SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient continues to be on TPN. APICC line has been placed and a triple lumen catheter will beremoved prior to transfer of the patient. It is our feeling thatthe patient should remain on TPN for the next two days and then asper your directions , the patient could be slowly advanced on a p.o.diet as tolerated. We feel that the patient deserves another trialto see if he can tolerate p.o. before any long term decisions ismade regarding his nutrition and perhaps placement of a J-tube forlong term feeding. The patient's amylase and lipase on the day ofdischarge are 47 for amylase and 166 for lipase. These valuescontinue to remain low even when the patient was having abdominalpain. This is felt to be due to a relatively burnt out pancreas.A GI consult was also obtained which agrees with this assessment.It is felt that when the patient does start taking p.o. again heshould have pancreas at least 8 to 12 , 000 units t.i.d. half hourbefore meals due to his pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Alsothe patient should be followed clinically very closely includinghis white count , fever curve and his abdominal exam for any signsand symptoms of development of an infection or phlegmon orpseudocyst because of his pancreatitis. The patient's TPN shouldbe continued as noted below.2. ENDOCRINE INSUFFICIENCY: The patient , as noted above , willrequire insulin , both through is TPN and his fingersticks should bechecked every six hours. As noted when the patient is switchedover to a p.o. regimen , we suggest per endocrine recommendationsthat NPH be given b.i.d. and the patient should be covered with aninsulin sliding scale at bedtime.The patient is being transferred to Redist Nalereamer Memorial Hospital on2 of April in good condition. The patient today denies any abdominalpain , nausea or vomiting , but occasionally continues to have mildback pain. His diarrhea has resolved. He is afebrile with a bloodpressure of 120/70 , pulse is 69 , respiratory rate 16 , sat 97 onroom air , with a weight of 69.0 kg. He is comfortable and has hadbibasilar crackles of 1/4 the way up. His abdomen is soft ,nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds. Hisextremities are without edema.On the day of discharge his white count is 8.8 , hematocrit is 36 ,ADDplatelets of 348. His SMA-7 was within normal limits with acreatinine of 0.6. His amylase is 47 and his lipase is 160.DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged in good conditionto Lakesfic Hospital Medical Center .  His primary carephysician Dr. Littmann is aware of the patient's discharge and willcontinue to follow with his care. The patient also has anappointment with Dr. Sanislo in the Diabetes Clinic at Longa Ent No on 7 of January at 11 a.m.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.2. Albuterol inhalers two puffs q.i.d.3. Digoxin 0.375 mg q.d.4. Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.5. Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.6. Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.7. Magnesium and potassium sliding scale through IVs while beinghere.DIET: The patient should remain n.p.o. for the next two days. HisTPN orders upon discharge should be as follows: He willhave a total of 2 liters per day at a rate of 83.3 ml per hourconstantly. He has a modified central solution of 5% aminoacid ,18% Dextrose , 400 lipids K-calories per day. His aminoacid shouldbe through a Novamine solution. His acetate is 0% His sodiumshould be 30 mEq per liter , magnesium should be 10 mEq per liter ,potassium 50 mEq per liter , phosphate 10 millimoles per liter.Trace elements 1 millimoles per day , vitamin K 10 mg q. Mondays ,MVI 10 ml per day , calcium 94 mg per liter. His insulin in the TPNshould be 45 units per liter of TPN. There should also beranitidine 150 mg per liter of TPN.

MAULDING , M.D.ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: 1. CARDIOMYOPATHY OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY.2. RETROSTERNAL CHEST PAIN FOR RULE OUTMYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.3. NONINSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.4. HISTORY OF PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS.CHIEF COMPLAINT: Mrs. Troy Burrus is a 54-year-old woman from Ston Chandseu Sa with a background history of idiopathiccardiomyopathy and noninsulin-dependent diabetes , and pulmonarytuberculosis who presented with an 20 minute episode of chest painand dyspnea for a rule out myocardial infarction.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is remarkable for 1 ) Acardiomyopathy of 10 years' duration ofunknown etiology. The patient denies alcohol abuse. There is nohistory of rheumatic fevers in childhood. There is no valvulardefects , and has no known risk factors for coronary artery disease ,aside from her noninsulin-dependent diabetes. The etiology at thispoint is thought to be viral. The patient experiences intermittentepisodes of mild chest pain and chest pressure with exertionapproximately one episode every 2-3 months and is not currently onsublingual nitrates. She has no known coronary artery disease andhas not had a myocardial infarction. 2 ) Noninsulin-dependentdiabetes times three years , well controlled on Glucotrol 10 mg p.o.b.i.d. and diabetic diet. She has no known diabetic retinopathy ,nephropathy or peripheral neuropathy. 3 ) The patient has a historyof tuberculosis approximately 20 years ago , diagnosed from a lymphnode biopsy of the left neck. She was treated for one year with acombination of medications. She currently experiences no nightsweats , loss or weight , loss of appetite or hemoptysis. She does ,however , admit to a dry cough especially at night which has beenincreasing over the last six months. Her BCG status is unknown.Past surgical history is remarkable for: 1 ) Status post cesareansection times one. 2 ) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy ,right salpingo-oophorectomy for metromenorrhagia approximately1991. The patient currently denies any post or perimenopausalsymptoms. 3 ) Status post lymph node biopsy of the left neckapproximately 20 years ago for tuberculosis. The patient has noknown drug allergies. Family history is remarkable for diabetesmellitus ( father ). The patient is a nonsmoker , denies alcohol abuseor intravenous drug abuse. Medications on admission includeDigoxin 0.1 mg p.o. q a.m. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10mg p.o. b.i.d. , K-Dur 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d. and Capoten 37.5mg p.o. q.i.d.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has noted increasingdyspnea and worsening exercisetolerance over the past six months. She was admitted to Namen's General Hospital under the care of Dr. Devera in April of 1992 forcongestive heart failure which resolved with diuresis. Since thenher baseline exercise tolerance is that she is unable to do a fullload of laundry without getting tired , unable to climb a fullflight of steps without getting tired , but does not experiencechest pain. However , today while walking in her sister-in-law'shouse she experienced severe retrosternal chest pain radiating toher left shoulder and back , which is as great as 10 out of 10 forseverity and lasted for approximately one minute. It was associatedwith dyspnea , sweating and nausea but no vomiting. She alsoexperienced some palpitations. Therefore , she had persistent chestpressure and dyspnea on arrival at the Amar Portraim HospitalEmergency Room approximately 20 minutes later , at which time thepressure and dyspnea were relieved with two sublingual nitrates.Review of systems is remarkable also for chronic cough increasingover the last five months , especially since her Capoten dose wasincreased. She denies fever , chills , previous episodes ofpneumonia. Of note she was ruled out for active pulmonarytuberculosis during her admission in Soba Medical Center in September 1992.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination on admission , she is apleasant , elderly woman. Her vital signsreveal a temperature of 97.4 orally , heart rate of 80 regular ,respiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 108/80 supine with noorthostatic hypertension. O2 saturation was 99% on 4 liters. Headand neck examination were unremarkable with no evidence ofadenopathy and a normal thyroid gland. Respiratory system showedscattered bibasilar crackles but no focal pathology. Cardiovascularsystem showed a heart rate of 80 which was regular at full volumewith occasional ectopic beats. There was no evidence of paradoxicalalternates. Jugular venous pressure was elevated to 10 cm abovethe angle of Louis' and had a prominent CV wave. All pulses werepresent and equal. The cardiac apex was in the sixth leftintercostal space. Midaxillary line was volume overloaded incharacter. No thrills or rubs were appreciated , however , there wasdullness to percussion beyond the apex and an S3 gallop was heardthroughout the precordium. The patient had a soft S1 , a III/VIpansystolic murmur heard best at the apex and radiating through tothe left axilla. There was also I/VI MVM which could be brought onwith exercise and lying in the left lateral position. A PI murmurwas also heart similar in character to the MI murmur but heard beston the left sternal border and radiating up the neck. There wasalso an ejection systolic murmur at the left sternal border II/VIin intensity and radiating poorly increased with expiration.Abdominal examination was soft , nontender , nondistended. There wasa 12 cm hepar which was soft and nonpulsatile. No spring waspalpable. No masses were appreciated. Bowel sounds were present ,and there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. A well healedsubumbilical midline scar was evident. Rectal examination showedno masses , guaiac negative brown stool. Bimanual examination wasdeferred at this time. Central nervous system examination wasgrossly intact. Extremities showed pulses to be presentbilaterally and equal. There was no evidence of deep venousthrombosis and no pedal edema or sacral edema were appreciated.LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory examinations on admission showed asodium of 136 , potassium 3.4 , blood urea nitrogen16 , creatinine 0.8 , and a glucose of 136. White count was 8.2 witha normal differential. Hematocrit was 41.2 and platelets 247. PTand PTT were 13.4 and 29.4 respectively. Digoxin level was 2.1.Chest X ray showed significant cardiomegaly with dilatation of bothleft and right ventricles but minimal congestive heart failure. Theelectrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats per minutewith a complete left bundle branch block and no evidence of acuteischemia. There was no change as compared with electrocardiogramsfrom 2/10 .  The initial CPK was 44.HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary then the patient is a 54-year-old womanwith cardiomyopathy , noninsulin-dependentdiabetes , who presented now with an episode of chest pain anddyspnea for rule out myocardial infarction and further evaluation.Actively she is in hospital where it as follows: 1 ) Cardiomegaly ofunclear etiology: last echo done was in 25 of November by Dr. Pernin whichshowed an ejection fraction of 25-30% with global left and rightventricular dilatation. 2 ) Chest pressure and substernal chest painand dyspnea: The patient was placed on the telemetry floor , wasmonitored for 24 hours and a rule out protocol was performed. TheCK were 44 , 37 , and 34 respectively and there was no evidence ofelectrocardiogram changes on serial electrocardiogram. She did haveone run of 4-beat ventricular tachycardia the first 24 hours ofadmission. Potassium was replaced in view of the potassium level of3.4. Initial Digoxin level was 2.1 and Digoxin was held for aperiod of 72 hours. She was continued on her Lasix , Captopril anda sliding scale Nitropaste and was started on one aspirin a day.3 ) Noninsulin-dependent diabetes was well controlled on diet andGlucotrol and her sugars remained between 100 and 200 throughoutthis admission. 4 ) Status post tuberculosis: In view of herprevious tuberculosis status , a PPD was not performed and thepatient was not ruled out for tuberculosis.On review of Mrs. Ekis 's history and following a rule out for arecent myocardial infarct , it became apparent that her exercisetolerance had diminished dramatically over the past three monthsand that she was already on optimal medications. It was thoughtthat she would benefit from a cardiac transplant evaluation at thispoint and Dr. Gerathy was kind enough to consult. A transthoracicechocardiogram performed on 2 of May showed once again a dilatedcardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. There was 2+ ofmitral regurgitation with a pulmonary arterial pressure ofapproximately 60. There was also 3+ or PR and evidence ofsignificant left atrial hypertrophy. No ventricular clicks orthrombosis were seen. However , in view of the dilatedcardiomyopathy , the patient was started on Coumadin therapy. An ETTO2 uptake test was performed on 2 of May and the patient performedfor 3.38 minutes on a cycle ergometer. She experienced on chestpain and there were no obvious electrocardiogram changes. The testwas stopped because of shortness of breath. Her O2 uptake wascalculated at 11.4 per kick per minute. In addition her Capotentherapy was changed from 37.5 q.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. At this pointit became apparent that Mrs. Stuesse had a significant degree ofcardiac dysfunction. A right-sided catheterization performed on5 of August showed a right atrial pressure of 26 and a pulmonary wedgepressure of 36. It was decided that she would be an excellentcandidate for cardiac transplantation , and a full cardiactransplant workup was initiated. The following tests were sent off ,the results of many of which are still pending: 1 ) One chest X raydetailed above; 2 ) electrocardiogram as detailed; 3 ) urinalysis andsediment which are unremarkable; 4 ) SMA-7 with CPK , complete withdifferential , PT , PTT , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , reticulocytecount and bleeding time; 5 ) HLA typing and antibody screen whichare pending; 6 ) blood typing; 7 ) dental consult; 8 ) physiotherapyconsult; 9 ) Social Service consult; 10 ) nutrition consult; 11 )Gynecology appointment made as an outpatient and a booking forbilateral mammography was made; 12 ) pulmonary function tests wereperformed; 13 ) noninvasive carotid Doppler studies and peripheralarterial noninvasive studies were performed the results of whichare pending; 14 ) echocardiogram as detailed above; 15 ) exercisetest with O2 as detailed above; 16 ) 24-hour urine for creatinineand protein; 17 ) HIV antibody test; 18 ) fasting glucose serumprotein , electrophoresis , cholesterol , triglycerides ,immunoglobulins , hepatitis B and C serology , as well as bloodcultures , sputum cultures and urine cultures were sent; 19 )psychiatric consults , has not been obtained at this point and willbe done as an outpatient; 20 ) virology titers for cytomegalovirus ,Ebstein-Barr virus , toxoid , measles and varicella zoster were sent;21 ) TFT and hemoglobin A1C were sent; and 22 ) right heartcatheterization as detailed above; 23 ) abdominal ultrasound to ruleout gallstones , aortic aneurysm and renal abnormalities were doneand were within normal limits.DISPOSITION: At this point the patient will be discharged home in astable but guarded condition. She will be followed bythe Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Departments at the Chapstone Hospital .  Her primary attending Dr. Mondelli from Sontriad University Hospitals( telephone number 990 062-8307 ) will be updated as to her program.Outstanding consults were be sorted on an outpatient basis and shewill be listed for a cardiac transplant. Her discharge medicationsinclude Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d , K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5mg p.o. t.i.d. She will also be sent home on home O2 as required.Digoxin will be started at 0.1 mg p.o. q d. PT and PTT levels willbe checked q weekly and the patient's doses changed accordingly.Dictated By: RASHAD F. HAMLETTE , M.D. GB7Attending: PASQUALE R.

Pt reports one day of crampy abdominal pain with associatedbilious vomiting. These symptoms are consistent with her previousangiodedema flares.Normally , patient manages her symptoms by increasing her danazol doseat home , but this time the increase was not enough to stabilizeher symptoms. Thus , she came to the ED to get FFP , which helps withflares by repleting the missing complement factors.Pt's first attack was when she was 10. Pt has had multiple flares thispast year including 6 admissions. She has had 3 tracheostomies inthe past for flares threatening her respiratory system. Her GIcomplications include multiple scarring/strictures - is scheduled for adilitation with GI next month. She has also had surgery in the past( 1994 )She thinks her trigger this admission is multiple stressors involvingthe health of many of her family members.GI doctor: Rapin Rheum/All: Andrea BilbroPMHx: HTN , Diverticulitis , Atrial Fib ( no coumadin , rate controlled )Hypothyroid , DVT , HAEMeds: atenolol , danazol , synthroid , allegra , ecasa , zantac , digoxinALL: sulfa , pcn , levo , ? iv contrastFHx: 2 grandkids with hereditary angioedemaVS: 97.9 152/84 114 14 97%RA irreg irreg , +s4 , cta b , +bs , distended ,mild diffuse tenderness , no pedal edemaLabs: wbc 10.3 ( with bandemia 10% ) , hct 49.6 plt 304 cr 1.3 , lipase 65CT: no obstruction , old stricture descending colonHospital Course and Plan82 year old woman with hereditary angioedema admitted with abdominalflare of her HAE , most likely triggered by stress.1.

Right knee osteoarthritis.PROCEDURE: Total knee replacement.PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64 year old female whohas worsening pain in her right kneeover many years. X-rays reveal osteoarthritis of the right knee.She is now admitted for right total knee replacement.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. Seizure disorder.3. Gout. 4. CVA in 1987. Surgery:Ovarian cyst , benign breast mass removed times two. Medications:Dyazide; Ecotrin; Allopurinol 300 mg p.o.q. day; Propranolol;Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o.b.i.d.; Sulindac 150 mg p.o.b.i.d.;Dilantin 100 mg two tabs t.i.d.; Ventolin inhaler two puffsq.i.d.p.r.n.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smokes approximately twopacks per week and denies alcohol.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: HEENT: Unremarkable. LUNGS: Clear.CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm ,without murmur , rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES:Mild valgus deformity of the right knee with 2+ crepitus , medialand lateral joint line tenderness.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to theOrthopedic Service and underwent righttotal knee replacement with Kinemax system. She was transferredto the floor in stable condition. Postoperatively she had a dropin blood pressure to a systolic of 70 with the epidural in place.With fluid bolus , her pressure then stabilized.On the first postoperative night the patient spiked to 103.9 witha temperature of 99 the following morning. The epidural wasdiscontinued and a urine culture was sent. The urine revealed 1+bacteria with 2+ squamous cells and 10 to 15 white blood cells.Therefore , the Foley was discontinued and the patient given onedose of gentamicin. A repeat white count revealed white bloodcell count of 12.9. Blood cultures , urine and epidural culturesremained negative. She was started on CPM and this was continuedpsotoperatively with the physical therapist.On postoperative day three she again spiked to 102.4 and wascomplaining of frequent urination and incontinence. Therefore ,she was started on an empiric course of Bactrim times 48 hours.Again , blood cultures were performed and these remained negativeat the time of discharge. The patient continued to do fairlywell with physical therapy though her progress was slow. Onpostoperative day five her temperature had remained less than100 degrees for 24 hours and her cultures remained negative. Herwound remained clean and nonerythematous without discharge. Shehad no complaints of shortness of breath or sputum production.She remained hemodynamically stable.It was therefore felt she was stable for discharge to the RehabCenter on 20 of October .  She will require aggressive physical therapyto increase her range of motion and her ambulation.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. Diet: Regular. Medications:Same as admission with Percocet one to two p.o.q. 4 to 6 hoursp.r.n. pain. She will also receive one additional day oftreatment with Bactrim.Followup: The patient will followup with Dr. Eugenio Faries .Dictated By: PASQUALE IORIO , M.D. QD00  ZH029/1667HERB RAUL ESTY , M.D. RL3 D: 10/7/92T: 10/7/92Batch: E637 Report: DO269H88 T:

Third and fifth toe amputation with wounddebridement.2. Lower extremity angiogram.3. Right transmetatarsal amputation.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45 year oldgentleman with a history of severeperipheral vascular disease who is status post aorto-bifemoral andbilateral femoral-popliteal bypass grafting , who originallypresented in August of this year with an ischemic right foot andgangrenous right great toe and fourth toe. Arteriogram revealed apopliteal stenosis below his bypass with very poor runoff. Thepopliteal artery was angioplastied with good results andrestoration of palpable anterior tibial pulses at the mid calf.The patient only had moderate perfusion of the right foot , however ,and presented in August of this year for wound debridement andfourth toe amputation. The patient re-presents with a poorlyhealing fourth toe amputation site and wound cellulitis.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has poorly controlled insulin dependentdiabetes. He is status post myocardialinfarction in 1993 , 1996 and 1997. He has severe peripheralvascular disease. He is status post bilateral femoral-poplitealand bypass graft. He is status post aorto-bifemoral. He has ahistory of coronary artery disease. He is status post coronaryartery bypass graft x three vessel. He has a history of congestiveheart failure , history of osteoarthritis.MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.day , Lasix 120 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Zestril 50 mg p.o. q.day , aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.day , insulin NPH 10 units q.a.m. , q.p.m. and insulin Regularsliding scale.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient is afebrile. Temperature was 98.2 ,blood pressure 100/80 , pulse 85 ,respirations 16. He had saturation of 98% on room air. Ingeneral , he is a white male in no acute distress. HEENT wasnormocephalic , atraumatic. Pupils were equally reactive to lightand accommodation. Extraocular muscles were intact. Sclerae wereanicteric. There was no lymphadenopathy. Lungs were clear toauscultation. Cardiac exam was regular rate and rhythm. Abdomenwas soft , nontender , nondistended , with normal active bowel sounds.Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Extremities were without clubbing ,cyanosis or edema. On vascular exam , patient had 3+ bilateralfemoral pulses , 2+ bilateral popliteal pulses. He had biphasicdopplerable bilateral posterior tibial pulses and a monophasicdopplerable right dorsalis pedis pulse and no dopplerable leftdorsalis pedis pulse. His right great toe had a black eschar onthe tip. His fourth toe amputation site was with purulentdrainage. His third toe was erythematous and tender to palpation.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the vascular servicefor wound debridement and IV antibiotics. He wasinitially evaluated by the cardiology service and endocrineservice. Patient was cleared by cardiology for the procedure andwas considered well managed medically in regard to his coronaryartery disease. In regard to patient's diabetes , he was initiallyextremely brittle and requiring extensive fine tuning by theendocrine service who , at the time of discharge , had his bloodsugars repeatedly under 200 , with easily achieved insulin regimen.The patient was taken to the operating room initially on the 13 of June ofApril where he underwent a right third and fifth toe amputationwith wound debridement. At the time of operation , purulentdrainage with necrotic regions of the bases of the third and fifthtoes were found. The wound was left open with packing , withfurther plans for more formal TMA after adequate drainage of thefoot. The patient , from the beginning of the hospital course , wasstarted on IV vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl which hecontinued throughout his hospital course. The patient toleratedthis initial wound debridement and toe amputation without incident.Please see dictated operative report for further details. Thepatient underwent an arteriogram on the 30 of August of April whichrevealed one vessel runoff via peroneal artery to an irregularappearing posterior tibial artery. The tibial peroneal trunk andthe proximal peroneal artery were found to have high gradestenoses. There were numerous collateral vessels to a dorsalispedis artery at the level of the ankle. Based on this arteriogramresult and his wound , patient was preop'd for a transmetatarsalamputation on the 2 of June of April . It was recommended by thevascular staff that transmetatarsal amputation was the only optionfor proximal limb salvage. He was not found to have anyappropriate anatomy for further reconstruction from an arterialstandpoint. The patient was taken to the operating room on the2 of June of April where he underwent a formal right transmetatarsalamputation. The patient's wound was debrided back to the viabletissue and was closed in a primary fashion. Please see dictatedoperative report for further details. Patient tolerated theprocedure well without complications and was transported back tothe PACU and the floor in stable condition. Postoperatively , thepatient has required wound packing to a small portion of the woundwhich was left open for drainage. Initially , the wound waserythematous with minimal to moderate drainage. At the time ofdischarge , the wound has become far less erythematous , far lesspainful and without any drainage. It is thought at this time thatpatient now had three weeks of IV antibiotics and is stable enoughto go home on a p.o. regimen. Patient will be discharged on p.o.levofloxacin and clindamycin with b.i.d. wound packing by VNAservice. Patient is discharged to home in stable condition withfollowup to be early this week with Dr. Deandrade .

APLASTIC ANEMIA. 2. HEMOCHROMATOSIS.CHIEF COMPLAINT/IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 34 year-old womanwith a 22 year history of aplasticanemia , transfusion dependent for 13 years , complicated byhemochromatosis , now with gram negative rod bacteremia.HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 34 year-old womandiagnosed with aplastic anemia 22years ago. The patient never had a potential donor for transplantand was immediately treated with immunosuppressive therapy foraplastic anemia using steroids without efficacy. The patientsuffered complications from steroid use , including avascularnecrosis , resulting in bilateral hip replacements as well aschronic bony damage to her shoulders for which she uses painmedications. For the past 13 year , the patient has remainedtransfusion dependent and requires a few units on packed red bloodcells on an every two week basis and platelet transfusions whenevershe develops epistaxis. In September of 1998 , the patient developeddiabetes mellitus. The patient had already been known to have anelevated ferratin due to blood transfusions from years previously.However , when she had been started on Desferal in the past , shedeveloped a port-a-cath infection and ultimately leakage ofDesferal to the surrounding skin , which resulted in extrusion ofher port-a-cath through her skin. She was therefore off Desferalfor a number of years. The patient presented in mid September of 1998with a blood glucose in the 500 to 600 range , associated withpolyuria , polydipsia , and a 19 pound weight loss. An abdominal CTscan was performed at that time , which was consistent with ironoverload. The patient's ferratin was noted to be the 7 , 000 range.The patient was begun on Insulin therapy and Desferal 24 hours aday. A port-a-cath was placed in the patient's left upper chest.The patient's Desferal was given at 2 grams per 24 hours. She hada gradual decrease in her Insulin requirements by 50%. In April of1998 , the patient went on vacation to Wark for two weeks.Toward the end of her stay , she developed an infected port-a-cathand was readmitted to the Jera Counta in earlyApril with a port-a-cath infection. At that time , four out of fourblood cultures grew out Staphylococcus aureus. Because of concernof the long term sequelae of Staphylococcus aureus infection , thepatient was treated with Nafcillin for six weeks. The patient didwell on Nafcillin with resolution of her fevers. The patient wasreadmitted to the Biehay Sciencesmot Hospital on October , 1998 toJuly , 1998 for a two day history of fevers to 101 associatedwith the development of a painful perirectal abscess. The abscesswas assessed and required surgical drainage after a platelettransfusion to increase the patient's platelets to 42 , 000. Thepatient underwent an incision through the Imount Sheo Bona Medical Center .  ByJuly , 1998 , the cultures from her abscess grew gram negativeenteric rods , sensitive to Cipro. All of the patient's bloodcultures were negative. Speciation of the gram negative rodsrevealed Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient was discharged home onCiprofloxacin , which she took for an additional ten days afterdischarge. Since September , 1998 , the patient had been off allantibiotics and the plan was for Licausi to have another set of bloodcultures drawn to document resolution of all infection prior to theconsideration of putting in a new central access , such as aHickman. The patient was seen at the H Care Healthon the day prior to admission and reported that she had beenentirely afebrile without chills. The patient also noted that herblood sugar was well controlled on a stable regimen of Insulin inthe 24 hours after she was seen in the clinic. Two out of fourblood cultures that were drawn in the clinic revealed gram negativerods. The patient was therefore asked to return to the Do County Hospital for treatment of gram negative rod bacteremia.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Aplastic anemia. 2. Hemochromatosis.3. Diabetes mellitus. 4.

She was afebrile without symptoms until daynine of ATGAM when a rash became apparent starting on her rightforearm with a rectangular red erythematous maculopapular patchwhich later extended over her entire body and it was pruritic. Noinvolvement of her orpharynx and no respiratory compromise wereever noted. This may have been partly secondary either to herATGAM being turned up on the night of 6 of March by the patient byaccident or also may have been due to Ceftaz and Vanco which wasstarted on 6 of March for a febrile episode on the eighth day ofATGAM. She was also noted during the episode of fever to have anerythematous eardrum , a couple of posterior cervical nodes onemeasuring about 1 cm x 2 cm which was tender to palpation , alsosome erythema of the right side of her oropharynx. Strep wasnegative. The patient was treated with Ceftaz and Vanc forpossible otitis. This was later changed to Augmentin when rash wasthought to be possibly secondary to Ceftaz and then this again waschanged later to po Cipro when she was no longer neutropenic andher symptoms appeared to be resolving. During the episode of therash her urine also changed to a dark coke-colored urine whichcontained red blood cells , no casts were noted , however , it wasfelt to be consistent with serum sickness and so the patient waschanged from the 40 mg prednisone started for the ATGAM so that shewould be afebrile and to minimize reaction of the ATGAM to IV SoluMedrol. She responded well to this with urine changing rapidly toyellow color still with some RBCs on discharge , however , she willbe discharged on 16 mg prednisone po bid and followed up inHematology to make sure the rash continues to fade and that herurine continues to improve. During hospitalization the patientrequired periodic transfusions for platelets and packed red bloodcells. She tolerated the packed red blood cell transfusion well ,however , in general she noted her usual reaction to platelets withrigors and chills and was given hydrocortisone 100 mg IV at thesame time. Also while using Solu Medrol one night prior toadmission she was given one bag of platelets for which shedeveloped a little bit of an increased rash which faded rapidly onstopping the platelets and a platelet blood transfusion reactionworkup was done. The labs on discharge are sodium 135 , potassium4.8 , BUN 20 , creatinine 1 , LDH 327 , alk phos 263 , magnesium 2.1 ,calcium 9.4 , white blood cell count 2.4 with 36 polys , 1 band , 55lymphs , and 8 monos , Hct 27.6 , and platelet count 7000 prior to onebag of platelets , MCV 88.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Nystatin 5 cc po qid prn , 60mg prednisone po bid , 1 gm Carafate po qid , calciumcarbonate 2500 mg po tid , Ciprofloxacin 750 mg po bid for 10 days ,chlorhexadine glucose 15 cc po bid , Benadryl 25 mg po qid prn ,Monistat cream for question of monoliasis , and Tylenol prn.

She was evaluated andPipelle biopsy was unsuccessful and fractional dilation andcurettage revealed scant inactive endometrial tissue. This was inJanuary of 1994. She had a follow-up endometrial biopsy which showedquantity not sufficient and there was no further follow-up. All ofthis was done outside of our offices. She saw Dr. Lamoreux forevaluation initially of an irregular cervix on her initial intakeinto the Ard Onhill Hospital Medical Center system and this historywas reviewed. She had always had normal Pap smears. Colposcopicbiopsy and endocervical curettage were all negative. She had notat that point had postmenopausal bleeding for a couple of years.Her uterus was felt to be overly enlarged and ultrasound showed a1.9 cm irregular stripe. Pipelle was not possible , due perhaps tostenosis of the internal os. Therefore she was brought forfractional dilation and curettage and diagnostic hysteroscopy as aninpatient because of her history of Coumadin therapy for chronicatrial fibrillation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for rheumatic heart disease withmitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation , aswell as aortic insufficiency and mild tricuspid insufficiency.

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.2. DIABETES MELLITUS.3. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Dersch is a 75 year old malewith a history of myocardialinfarction x2 , status post CABG x3 in 1993 , who was admitted with arecent event of stable ventricular tachycardia. The patient'scoronary risk factors include age , male gender , positive familyhistory , history of myocardial infarction , diabetes mellitus , andhypercholesterolemia. The patient has no history of hypertensionor tobacco use. The patient's history actually began in 1988 whenhe had chest pain and ruled in for an anteroseptal myocardialinfarction. In 9/16 , he presented to the emergency room with widecomplex tachycardia requiring electrical cardioversion at theJoadi Community Hospital .  During the admission in 1998 , thepatient had a catheterization which revealed proximal LADocclusion , an occluded proximal descending artery off his rightcoronary artery , normal hemodynamics , anteroseptal hypokinesis ,inferior hypokinesis , apical thrombus , and aneurysm with an EF of50%. An EP study revealed 27 and 22 beat runs of nonsustainedV-tach with left bundle branch block inducible after threeventricular extra stimuli during ventricular drive pacing at 400msec. The ventricular tachycardia was initially suppressed withquinidine , but the patient subsequently developed nausea andvomiting , and the quinidine was switched to aconine. Thepatient did well on this regimen until 3/13 , when he developeddyspnea on exertion , no chest pain , PND , and orthopnea. In 1/16 ,the patient had an exercise tolerance test , which she failedsecondary to fatigue. During this ETT , his blood pressure actuallyfell from 125 to 85 systolic and his EKG revealed 1 mm STdepression in the limb leads. Therefore , on 8/5/93 , he wasadmitted to the Eredrens Recraw University Of Medical Center and underwent cardiaccatheterization , which revealed 100% LAD and RCA occlusion , 60%proximal ramus stenosis , and left ventriculogram revealed anteriorhypokinesis , inferior hypokinesis , and apical dyskinesis with anejection fraction of 48%. The decision was then made during his1/16 admission to proceed with surgical revascularization. Duringhis admission , he underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypassgraft with LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the rightcoronary artery and proximal descending artery , with endarterectomyto the proximal descending artery. The patient also underwent anEP study , and it was found that his sustained ventricular was nolonger inducible either at baseline or during isoproterenolinfusion. Since 1993 , the patient has been doing well up until theday of admission on 3/1 .On the day of admission , the patient developed light-headedness andpalpitations while using the toilet. The patient denied any chestpain , dyspnea , nausea or vomiting at the time. EMS was notified ,and the patient was found to be in V-tach. The patient was takento an outside hospital and cardioverted at 100 joules after failingattempted pharmacologic conversion with Lidocaine , adenosine , andamiodarone. The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and wastransferred to the Villecam Medical Center for further evaluationand possible placement of AICD.On his admission , the patient was without complaints except forsome mild lower abdominal pain , which the patient attributed to hisknown constipation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: CABG in 1993 , details noted above.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies use of tobacco , alcohol , ordrugs.

Patient was in her usual stateof health while in vascular clinic , awaiting to discuss the resultsof arterial studies with her vascular surgeon , when she noted toslump over in the chair in the waiting room for about 1-2 minutes.She was unresponsive at the time. A code blue was called. By thetime the code team arrived to the scene , the patient was awake andalert , with a regular pulse. Her blood pressure was noted to be inthe 140s. The patient did not recall an aura or a prodrome. Shedenied any incontinence and aura or postictal confusion. She wastaken to the Emergency Department for evaluation , where she wasafebrile , with a heart rate of 96.1 , heart rate of 100 , a pressureof 178/82 , with oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She wasthen transferred to the floor for further evaluation andmanagement.Her past medical history is as follows: 1. Coronary arterydisease , status post multiple catheterizations in the past. Hermost recent catheterization was in October of 2000 , which showed aproximal RCA stenosis of 100% and a distal LAD lesion of 40-50%.She was also noted to have luminal irregularities at the OM-1 at asite of previous stenting. 2. Peripheral vascular disease ,history of chronic ulcers , status post a left femoral to anteriortibial bypass graft; also , status post a patch angioplasty in theleft groin. 3. Diabetes mellitus. Hemoglobin A1C of 9% in Octoberof 2002. 4. Hypertension. 5. Blindness , legally blind in botheyes.Medications on admission included enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.q. day , captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.day , Isordil 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , NPH 15U q.a.m. regular 5 U q.a.m. , Hytrin 5 mg p.o. q. day , Procardia XL60 mg p.o. q. day , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q. day , Niferex 150 mg p.o.b.i.d. , and Naprosyn 325 mg p.o. q. day. The patient has no knowndrug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in Arbafontpringsalb O Land near her daughter. Shespends most of her time at home. She does notsmoke and does not drink alcohol.PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: She was afebrile. Heart rate was 50and regular. Blood pressure was140/80. Respiratory rate was 20 , saturation of 98% on room air.She was a pleasant African American woman lying in bed. She hasher right eye closed. She had a surgical right pupil , with a leftcataract. Her oropharynx was benign , her mucous membranes weremoist. She had no jugular venous distention. There was a questionof soft bilateral carotid bruits. The lungs revealed decreasedbreath sound at the left apex , but otherwise was clear toauscultation. Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate andrhythm , there were no murmurs appreciated in the EmergencyDepartment. The abdomen was soft , without hepatosplenomegaly. Inthe extremities , there are incisional scars at the medial calves onboth legs , with 1+ DP pulses bilaterally , her legs were warm , andthere was no edema. On neuro exam , she was alert and oriented x 3 ,cranial nerves III-XII were grossly normal , and her motor exam waswithout focal deficits.LABORATORIES OF NOTE: Her potassium was 3.8 , her BUN was 39 , andher creatinine was 1.9 , her baselinecreatinine being anywhere between 1.7 and 2.0. Glucose was 122.Her troponin on admission was 0.32 , and of note , back in Octobershe had also been admitted and was noted to have a troponin in the.3 range. Her CK on this admission was 308 , with an MB fraction of3.9. Calcium was 9.2 , magnesium was 2.7 , white blood cell count6.1 , hematocrit 36 , platelets 238. Her UA was negative. Her EKGshowed normal sinus rhythm at 85 , with left axis deviation ,evidence of LVH , left atrial enlargement , and some T waveflattening in V4 through 6 and T wave inversion in 1 and L. Herchest x-ray was without infiltrate or pulmonary arterialcongestion.In summary , this is a 65-year-old woman with vasculopathy andextensive coronary artery disease , who presented with suddensyncope x 1-2 minutes. Given the history , the story was veryconcerning for a malignant arrhythmia. She was admitted forfurther workup of ischemic or malignant arrhythmia causes of hersyncope.Her hospital course is summarized by systems: 1. CARDIOVASCULAR:The patient was placed on the monitor and no definitye symptomatic arrhythmiaswere observed. However , because of her demonstrated asymetricallyhypertrophied left ventricle and ergions of inferoposterior scar ,electrophysiology study was recommended ( see below and addendum ).The patient was initially admitted with a troponin of0.32 , which on repeat examination was 0.87. It wasthought to be consistent with a very small non-Q-wave MI. She wasstarted on heparin for 48 hours. On 10/30/2002 , the patient had anadenosine MIBI , which showed a moderate size lesion ofinferolateral and a small apical region of reversible ischemic.She had a cardiac catheterization on 1/9/2002 , which revealed an80% proximal circumflex lesion which was stented to 0%. She had anechocardiogram performed on 3/10/2002 , which showed a left atrium of 2.9 cm.She had asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy , with preserved overallsystolic function and an ejection fraction estimated to be 60%. This wasthought to be a potential source of focus for ventricular arrhythmias , andfurther supported the decision to go to electrophysiology study.2. PULMONARY: One of the considerations entertained to explainthe patient's syncope was a potential pulmonary embolus. Thoughshe had not been hypoxic on presentation , the sudden nature of theevent , as well as her tachycardia , was felt to warrant furtherworkup for a PE. She had a D-dimer sent , which came back at >1000.She later had a VQ scan which was read as low probability. Lowerextremity noninvasive ultrasounds of both legs revealed nothrombus.3. ENDOCRINE: The patient has insulin dependent diabetesmellitus. We continued her morning NPH dose and covered her withregular insulin sliding scale for the remainder of herhospitalization. Her sugars were relatively well controlledthroughout.4. SOCIAL/PSYCH: The patient has a known difficult homesituation , with previous known problems with her son and otherfamily members. Social Services was involved. They interviewedthe patient and involved a consult to Crest Medical .  At thetime of this dictation , that evaluation is still pending.The final disposition of the patient is still pending at this time.I will complete this dictation at the time of discharge , includingthe patient's disposition and disposition medications.Dictated By: GARRY PLAINY , M.D. WX53Attending: DARIUS JEZ , M.D. NI60  UA233/329907Batch: 72289 Index No. OLXVJ982EG D: 7/22/02T: 7/22/02

Chest x-ray revealedquestion of a right lower lobe infiltrate. This was alsoconsistent with a mild pulmonary edema.HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Sartoris , in the Emergency Department , wastreated with IV cefuroxime. She was subsequentlybrought to the floor , and the Medical Team's assessment decided totreat her empirically for a right lower lobe pneumonia withlevofloxacin. It was not all that clear that Ms. Bartlett had apneumonia , but she was treated for this anyway. She also had aurine Legionella antigen , which was checked , as well as sputumcultures which were unremarkable.From a cardiovascular perspective , Ms. Cheesman ruled out for amyocardial infarction , but received some Lasix for mild CHF.During her hospital course , it was noted that her hematocritdropped from 33.3 to 28.4. This was mildly concerning given herhistory of an infrarenal AAA. It was decided that she should havean abdominal CT. This was done , and the abdominal aortic aneurysmhas not changed in size or did not reveal any evidence of leaking.Ms. Villenas quickly improved after being treated with nebulizers.She was then switched from nebulizers to inhalers and it wasdecided that she was well enough to go home. Of note , her rightfinger joints were mildly swollen and possibly consistent with agouty flare. She was treated initially with Indocin , but thenthere was the concern that she could potentially have a GI bleed.Thus , she was quickly taken off of the Indocin.Ms. Peteet was discharged in stable condition to follow-up with herprimary care physician.

The patient was pale , ill appearing with anNG tube in place. Her cardiac exam revealed an S3 gallop. PMIwas displaced and sustained. Heart rate was regular in rate andrhythm. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Abdomen was distendedand tender , no rebound or guarding. The left lower quadranthernia was approximately 15 cm in size and reducible. The ostomywas without any output. Neurological exam revealed no focaldeficits or facial droops.OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: None.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:1. GI: The patient presented with a small-bowel obstruction.The point of transition was thought to be in the pelvis by thesecond Radiology opinion , she was kept n.p.o. , NG tube tosuction. SBO resolved on 4/4/05 . Her abdominal exam improved.Her pain improved. At the time of discharge , her ostomy wasputting out green stool. Lactate levels were followed , with apeak of 1.4 and then back down to 0.8. The patient was kept onan IV proton pump inhibitor , then switched to p.o. At the timeof discharge , her diet was being advanced as tolerated. She wastolerating a mechanical soft diet.2. Cardiovascular: The patient has CHF with an EF of 15 to 20%.She was gently hydrated during the small-bowel obstruction. Herdigoxin was continued. Her beta-blocker was switched toLopressor. Her diuretics were held. Her hydralazine and Isordilwere held as well as her aspirin in the event that she should goto the operating room. These were added back. At the time ofdischarge , she was on Coreg , hydralazine , Isordil , digoxin , andaspirin at her home doses. Diuretic can be added back fordiuresis , once the patient is taking improved p.o.'s. Thepatient had several runs of V-TAC and frequent PVCs on themonitor. Her electrolytes were corrected for a potassium of 4and magnesium of 2. She was asymptomatic with these rhythms.Her heart rate was in the 90s. Her blood pressure was in the110s/50s-70s at the time of discharge.3. Endocrine: The patient was continued on 15 units of NPHq.a.m. , 7 units of NPH q.p.m. , as well as a Regular Insulinsliding scale for very strict glucose control. This regimenresulted in occasional episodes of hypoglycemia to 33 and 44respectively. The patient was symptomatic with a blood sugar of33. She received an amp of D50 and her blood sugar improved. Herregimen was adjusted at the time of discharge , she was on NPH 8units subcu q.a.m. and a Regular Insulin sliding scale. Her NPHshould be titrated as her oral intake improves. The patient ison chronic prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis. She was switchedto hydrocortisone 10 mg IV q.8h. She did not require a stresseddose. She was switched back to her oral dose of prednisone.4. Renal: The patient's phenol on presentation was 0.25. Hercreatinine was 2.8 , which was elevated from her baseline afterdischarge at Ketchwo of 2.4. Her creatinine rose to 3.3 andthen began to trend down. Her creatinine was 2.4 and then 2.3 onthe day of discharge. Her acute on chronic renal failure wasthought to represent dehydration as well as poor forward flow dueto third spacing and decreased intravascular volumes. Her bloodpressures tended to be on the low side when she was firstadmitted. These improved with rehydration to the point where herhome blood pressure medications could be restarted.5. ID: The patient was started on levofloxacin 500 mg IVq.4-8h. and Flagyl 500 mg IV q.8h. for an elevated white count onadmission of 14.65 with 87.3% neutrophils. Her blood culturesfrom 6/12/05 were positive , two out of four bottles in 24 hoursfor Gram-positive cocci identified as MRSA. She was started onvancomycin 1 gm IV q.48h. This will need to be continued for atotal of two weeks , start day 6/20/05 , stop day 8/7/06 .Levofloxacin and Flagyl were started on 7/11/05 , stop date4/16/06 . The patient remained afebrile and her bands trendeddown from a peak of 39 to 3 the day prior to discharge.6. Rheumatologic: The patient was continued on steroids forrheumatoid arthritis and chronic steroid dependence.7. Neuro: The patient had episodes of disorientation , likelydue to sundowning two days prior to placement. She required 0.5mg of IV Haldol for extreme agitation. She also requiredtrazodone 100 mg p.o. q.h.s. for sleep.8. Physical therapy: The patient was out of bed to chair. Shetypically walks with a walker. She will require rehabilitationfor improved coordination and strength.9.

He was in his usual state ofhealth until November , 2006 , when he had a sudden loss of functionof his lower upper extremity and lower right extremity. He wasadmitted to Lihiltcat Medical Center Neurology Service , wherean MRI revealed a right internal capsule lacunar stroke. He wasout of the TPA window. As a result , he was treated with aspirinand statin. An echo showed a normal EF and no evidence ofthrombosis. There was no evidence of a-fib. His hospitalcourse , however , was complicated with Foley trauma and hematuriafor which he required continuous bladder irrigation. The patientalso developed a UTI by UA , but not a positive culture data. Thepatient was seen briefly by Urology , who recommended continuedbladder irrigation and followup. He was then treated withceftazidime x3 and the patient was discharged to rehab on Novemberwith a chronic bladder irrigation and urology followup for a UTurogram.The patient did fairly well in rehab until the day prior toadmission , which was on November , 2006 , after one day of beingdischarged from rehab when , during a physical therapy session ,the patient accidentally manipulated the Foley catheter causingincreased pain and worsening hematuria. So , then the patientcame to the ED the next day after the patient was alreadydischarged. The patient came to the ED on November , 2006. Thepatient was hemodynamically stable but complained of severepelvic pain and received 10 mg of IV morphine , Dilaudid ,Percocet , Valium and Ativan. The patient then becameincreasingly sedated and developed an O2 requirement , and waseventually on lung non-rebreather. By the time he was admittedto the medicine floor , the patient was very sedated and difficultto arouse. ABGs showed a 7.25/71/90 and he received 0.04 mg ofNarcan. He immediately awoke; however , then continued to becomesedated within 30 minutes. As a result , the patient was sent toICU on May , 2006. The patient had systolic blood pressure inthe 60s and was given Narcan and IV fluids. However , thesystolic pressure only responded to 90s. The patient alsocomplained of diffuse abdominal pain. However , KUB showed anonspecific bowel gas pattern. The patient was required tocontinue Narcan boluses and his ABG started to show improvement.It was 7.33/56/113 on 100% non-rebreather. During the overnightICU stay , the patient did very well. Eventually , the patient washemodynamically stable with systolic pressure maintaining verywell over 100 with a JVP over 10. The patient was more awake thenext day after admission to ICU overnight.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMCardiovascular: As a result , the patient was hypotensive on thefloor at the beginning due to being over-narcotized in the ED.Systolic pressure dropped to the lowest in the 60s. However ,after the ICU stay , as well as boluses with Narcan IV fluids , thepatient's blood pressure returned to be stable , with systolicblood pressure above 100. The patient's echo was also normal theweek before and there were no signs of systolic dysfunction. Thepatient was continued on aspirin and statin and , after the ICUstay , the patient was transferred back to the floor and thepatient's cardiovascular was stable and the patient'santihypertensive regimen was resumed. The patient's heart ratewas usually maintained between 50 to 67. At times , the patient'sLopressor has to be held due to the low heart rate. As a result ,Lopressor was titrated down from 25 mg to 12.5 mg b.i.d. Thishappened during the hospital stay. The patient also resumed backon his captopril 6.25 mg t.i.d. The patient was admitted to thefloor on telemetry and throughout the 3-4 days prior todischarge , the patient was stable on the floor and remainedcardiovascularly and hemodynamically stable. The patient wascontinued on statin and aspirin.Pulmonary: The patient has weaned off the non-rebreather afterthe stay from ICU and has been satting well between 96-97% on 3-4liters. The patient's lungs have remained cleared and thepatient's Lasix has resumed at 20 mg daily due to the patienthaving a negative Lasix of 40 mg daily. The patient was resumedback to his original regimen upon discharge. The patient has hadminimal crackles during his stay here in the hospital.Infectious disease: The patient was given vancomycin andceftazidime in the setting of hypotension and concern forpossible sepsis at the beginning. However , due to no growth todate with the blood cultures , the infectious etiology ofhypotension is unlikely. As a result , antibiotics were notcontinued when the patient was transferred back to the floor.Urology: The patient continued to have hematuria upon admissionto the MICU , likely secondary to Foley trauma. The patientcontinued to have chronic continued bladder irrigation for thefollowing two days after discharge from the MICU. Under theevaluation by the urologist , the patient does not need chronicbladder irrigation anymore. The urologist suggested that thebladder has actually stopped bleeding with clear urine drained.Of note , the patient was very agitated at one point on the secondday upon discharge from the MICU and pulled the Foley out , whichcreated a trauma to the bladder neck. However , the bleedingstopped very quickly and the urologist placed a second Foley intothe bladder without any complications. Urology recommended thatthe patient be followed by Dr. Anderson Veley as an outpatient. Intheir opinion , the patient does not have any urological symptoms ,and the patient should have the Foley for the following 4-5weeks. Per Urology , the patient may not be able to control hisbladder due to the stroke that the patient had the week before ,so the patient will need chronic Foley for the next 4-5 weeksuntil followup with the urologist in the office.

However , the patient'screatinine recovered dramatically from 1.5 to 0.7 upon discharge.The patient also had an obstruction in which the patient wasunable to void , which created a postrenal azotemia at one time ,but both prerenal and postrenal azotemia have resolved upondischarge.Neuro: Mental status intact. The patient has been doing verythroughout the two days prior to discharge. The patient wasalert and oriented x3. However , the patient occasionallycomplained about the leg pain from the side in which the patienthas lost motor function. The patient remained to have lefthemiparesis and required 100 mg Neurontin t.i.d. for pain controlregimen. Otherwise , the patient was evaluated by both , will befollowed by Neurology on April , 2006.Diet: The patient had normal cardiac diet and the patient willcontinue on the diet when the patient is discharged to rehab.Prophylaxis: The patient should resume his Lovenox 40 mg dailyand the patient should have aspirin and Nexium for prophylaxis.Psychiatry: The patient was given Ambien 10 mg p.o. at bedtimefor sleep and he responded very well with the regimen. Thepatient was also given Seroquel for anti-anxiety medication.MEDICATIONS:1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.2. Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. daily.3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.4.

BRADYARRHYTHMIA.SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1. SYNCOPE.PROCEDURES: Pacemaker insertion , 24 of November .IDENTIFICATION: Sixty year old black female who has a chiefcomplaint of dizziness and syncope. The source ofhistory was the patient , who was a moderate historian and the oldchart. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: According to the patient , shefirst presented to the medical system in 1989. At that time shewas walking at home and became dizzy. She was taken to Meeville Valley Health in Rhode Island She was told that she had a heartattack and was placed on a monitor when she was noted to have anepisode of asystole on the monitor. This led to emergent pacerinsertion. After pacer placement , the dizziness never recurreduntil a few months ago. This led to hospitalization on May , 1994at Xas*tu Hospital Medical Center .  She was seen by the pacer servicewho interrogated her pacer and found it functioning normally.However , the pacer lead type ( MECHRONIC 4012 ) is felt to have ahigh failure rate , necessitating a new pacer insertion.Unfortunately , the patient left AMA before the procedure could beperformed.Today , the patient got out of bed and preceded to the bathroom ,where she had a normal bowel movement without any symptoms. Shegot up from the toilet and while walking back to bed became dizzyagain. She subsequently passed out for an undetermined time.After waking up she knew exactly where she was and had nopost-ictal symptoms. She fell to the floor , but denies any trauma.She also denied urinary/fecal incontinence during this episode.She adamantly denies chest pain , shortness of breath or significantpalpitations. She presented today to the ER for evaluation.Medications on admission - None. No known drug allergies. PASTMEDICAL HISTORY: None. HABITS: No tobacco , no alcohol. SOCIALHISTORY: Unemployed , divorced , mother of six children. FAMILYHISTORY: Positive for hypertension. No seizure disorder in thefamily and her mother and two aunts have pacemakers inserted.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Morbidly obese black female inno acute distress without complaintspresently. T 98.3 , blood pressure lying down 120/80 , sitting up133/82 , heart rate lying down 72 , heart rate sitting up 80 ,respiratory rate is 16 , O2 sat is 98% on room air. HEENT -Anicteric. Clear oropharynx. Neck is supple. Lungs are clear.Back - Without spinal or cvat. Cardiovascular - Regular rate andrhythm. No jugular venous distention. Normal S1 and S2 , no S3 orS4 , no murmurs. Carotids with normal upstrokes and no bruits.Abdomen - Positive bowel sounds , obese , soft , nontender , noorganomegaly. Extremities - No pitting edema. 2+ radial and DPpulses bilaterally. Neuro - Alert and oriented times three.Cranial nerves III-XII are tested and are intact. Sensation isgrossly intact. Motor strength - Normal gait , not tested.Reflexes are 1-2+ patella and biceps reflexes , symmetrically.LABORATORY DATA: K 3.9 , mag 2.1 , Hematocrit 38.9. Chest x-rayis negative. Costophrenic angles were notvisualized well secondary to her large habitus. EKG showed normalsinus rhythm at 72 , first degree AV block , PR interval of 0.30 ,left ventricular hypertrophy.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the unit. Her storywas most consistent with an arrhythmia inducedsyncope. Considering her history , it was felt that she certainlyhad a symptomatic bradycardic episode. Because her currentpacemaker had a very high failure rate , we recommended changing thepacemaker and the patient agreed. She was placed on the cardiacmonitor without any event over her hospital stay.As part of her prepacer work-up , she had a right upper extremityvenogram which showed patent vessels on that side. The patient hada pacemaker insertedon 24 of November in the OR without any complications.The reason it was done in the OR was because of her large size andthe strength of the table. After pacer insertion , the patient didvery well without any further symptoms of dizziness or syncope. Shewas discharged to home the following day in good condition.DISPOSITION: Discharge medications - Keflex 500 mg q8h for ninedoses , Percocet 1-2 p.o. q6h p.r.n. pain.

No vomiting , diarrhea , cough , or dysuria. Onpresentation , the patient was found to be hypotensive , in septicshock , with bacteremia in urinary tract infection and admitted tothe Medical ICU for pressure support.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for heart rate of 94 ,blood pressure of 80-90/50. Notable for heart exam with regularrate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , with 3/6 systolic crescendomurmur and decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal borderradiating to the clavicles and carotids , and 3/6 holosystolicmurmur at the apex radiating to the axilla , and an apical heave.JVP flat. Chest with crackles in the right middle lung fields andleg basilar crackles. Abdominal exam was benign. Guaiacnegative. Extremities with no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.RELEVANT STUDIES AND TESTS: Blood culture on 10/13Streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC0.19. Urine culture on 10/13 Greater than 100 , 000 Klebsiellapneumoniae , ampicillin resistant , gentamicin sensitive , andlevofloxacin sensitive. TEE on 10/17 Severe mitralregurgitation , posterior leaflet with mitral calcifications andlinear density concerning for endocarditis.HOSPITAL COURSE:IMPRESSION: A 76-year-old female with mitral regurgitation ,history of CHF , history of recurrent UTI , who presented withnausea and chills , had hypotension requiring a medical ICU stay x2 days , with Streptococcus viridans bacteremia and mitralcalcifications in linear density concerning for endocarditis plusKlebsiella UTI.1. Infectious disease: The patient presented with chills andhypotension and was admitted to the MICU from the ED fortreatment of septic shock. Her mean arterial pressures were keptabove 65 with Levophed. She initially was treated withlevofloxacin and vancomycin to treat Gram-positive coccibacteremia and UTI. Blood culture from 5/15 , grew outStreptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin MIC0.19. Urine culture was positive for Klebsiella , ampicillinresistant , gentamicin and levofloxacin sensitive. On 1/11 ,antibiotics were changed to penicillin 3 million units IV q.4h.and gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. ATEE on 5/29 showed severe mitralregurgitation with posterior leaflet calcifications and lineardensity concerning for endocarditis. Therefore , a PICC line wasplaced on 10/11 for continuation of a six-week course ofpenicillin 3 million units IV q.4h. until 1/3 and two-weekcourse of gentamicin 50 mg IV q.8h. until 9/12 .  She will followup in the Infectious Disease Clinic with Dr. Ramiro Halcom on1/5/05 at 8 a.m.2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was maintained onaspirin. Lipitor was initially helped for an initialtransaminitis presumed to be secondary to shock liver , that atthe time of discharge her liver enzymes had normalized and shewas restarted on her Lipitor. Pump: The patient has a historyof congestive heart failure , with an ejection fraction 60% in6/8 .  She had hypotension , requiring Levophed until 2/5 .  Shehad an episode of flash pulmonary edema on 6/16 in the settingof fluid bolus and one unit of packed red blood cells. She has avery attenuatus balance between preload dependence and overload.Her Lasix and ACE-I were held while she was hypotensive. Becauseher systolic blood pressure continued to be low in the 90s andlow 100s , attempt was not made to re-add the ACE while in thehospital. It is anticipated that her cardiologist and outpatientphysicians will attempt to add the ACE back onto her medicalregimen for better afterload reduction as her blood pressuretolerates. The patient also has a very severe mitralregurgitation , which would be one of the reasons that an ACE onher medication regimen would be beneficial. Rhythm: The patientwas maintained on telemetry , and was found to be a normal sinusrhythm with ectopy , including short once of nonsustainedventricular tachycardia. She was started on Lopressor 12.5 mgt.i.d. on 1/11 , and this was increased to 25 mg b.i.d. atdischarge , with her heart rates continuing to be between the 70sand the 90s , however , with less episodes of ectopy. Herelectrolytes were also well repleted.3. Gastrointestinal: The patient had evidence of shock liver( 4/10 with an ALT of 135 , AST of 177 , alkaline phosphatase of251 , and T bili of 1.7 ) that is now resolving. Lipitor was held ,and was started as a transaminitis resolved. Non-contrast CT ofthe abdomen showed biliary sludge and gallstones , no evidence ofacute cholecystitis. Right upper quadrant ultrasound confirmedthe CT findings. Colon cancer is a concern with the patient'sanemia being new since 5/8 .  Her last colonoscopy was in 2000 ,and she will benefit from repeat colonoscopy as an outpatient.She was continued on Nexium for prophylaxis. Heme: The patienthad guaiac positive stools in the medical ICU , her hematocrit wasstable around 33%. She has a microcytic anemia with an MCV of79 , her iron studies ( iron of 10 , TIBC of 191 , ferritin is 744 )suggesting anemia of chronic disease with possibly overlying irondeficiency.4. Endocrine: The patient had a normal random cortisol level of35.3. She had an uncertain diagnosis of diabetes and was on thePortland protocol in the medical ICU. Hemoglobin A1c , however ,was 6.5. Therefore , she was maintained thereafter only oninsulin sliding scale and rarely required any coverage.5. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on Lovenox and Protonix.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , iron sulfate 325 mgdaily , gentamicin sulfate 50 mg IV q.8h. until 9/12 for atwo-week course , penicillin G potassium 3 million units IV q.4h.until 1/3 for a six-week course , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. ,Caltrate plus D2 tablets p.o. daily , Lipitor 10 mg daily , andProtonix 40 mg daily. The patient has not been restarted on herhome Lasix and lisinopril secondary to persistently low bloodpressures between the 90s and 100s. It is anticipated thatespecially her Lisinopril and her Lasix will be added back on toher medical regimen as her blood pressure tolerates. Given thatshe was no longer on Lasix , she was also taken potassiumchloride.DISPOSITION: The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitationat Acanmingpeerra Virg Tantblu Medical Center in order to be able to get her antibiotictherapy. She was discharged on stable condition.PHYSICIANS FOLLOW-UP: The patient has been following follow-upappointments:1. Stress test in 2/6/05 at 3 p.m.2. Dr. Gale Montante ( general cardiology ) on 7/10/05 at 10 a.m.3. Dr. Ed Storti 3/22/05 at 12 p.m.4. Dr. Stacey Koers ( infectious disease ) 1/5/05 at 8 a.m.The patient will follow up regarding the success of herantibiotic therapy.

Heebsh MD , PHD.PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , status postmyocardial infarction; diabetes mellitus; hypertension;hypothyroidism; and anxiety.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , this is an 82-year-old malewith a history of CHF with an EF 10% to 15% who is status postMI , history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , andhypothyroidism. There is also a question of a history of atrialfibrillation as well.In the past 2 months , the patient had complaints of increasingdyspnea on exertion with being unable to walk from one end of theroom to the other without becoming short of breath; a mild weightgain of 3 pounds as well; and a stable , 2-pillow orthopnea.On August , 2005 , the patient awakened from sleep with a suddenonset of shortness of breath and chest pressure associated withnausea and vomiting. The patient presented to an outsidehospital emergency department where his blood pressure wasstable , and he was saturating 94% on room air. He was treatedwith IV Lopressor and nitroglycerin , sublingual and topical. Hewas admitted at that hospital , and Cardiology was consulted whodiagnosed him with a mild CHF by his physical examination. Achest x-ray was with bibasilar opacities that were more likelyatelectasis. The patient was ruled out for an MI at thathospital and treated with Lasix at the home doses of Lasix 40 mgp.o. b.i.d. with stable systolic blood pressures of 100s to 110s.His course at that hospital was complicated by a nonsustainedventricular tachycardia through which he was asymptomatic. Hewas started on Lovenox b.i.d. for a low EF.The patient was transferred to the Laismode Hospitalon May , 2005 , for elective placement of an AICD.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Atrial fibrillation , anxiety , CHF with anEF of 10% to 15% , MI , diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,hypothyroidism , status post cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis ,and a history of probable prostate ??___??.MEDICATIONS: The patient's home medications had included Lasix40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl 10 mEq q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. ,Levoxyl 150 mcg q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , digoxin 0.125 mgq.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. ,trazodone 50 mg to 100 mg q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , and Ativan 0.5mg p.r.n.Transfer medications include digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , levothyroxine150 mcg q.d. , glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 20mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,atenelol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , KCl 10 mEqp.o. q.d. , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Ativan 0.5 mg p.o.q.h.s. , and there is a question whether the patient was currentlyon Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously b.i.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is an ex-smoker and quit smokinggreater than 20 years ago. He lives with his wife.FAMILY HSITORY: Both the parents of the patient are with a CADin their 70s.PHYSICAL EXAMIANTION: The patient's vital signs upon arriving onthe floor; temperature was 94.5 , pulse was 64 , blood pressure was120/60 , respirations were 20 , and he was saturating 98% on roomair. Examination was remarkable for JVP at his jaw and moistmucous membranes. Heart had a regular rate and rhythm withfrequent ectopy and S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4. The lungs were with afaint left bibasilar crackles. Abdomen was benign. Theextremities were with no pitting edema but slightly coolbilaterally. Neurological examination is nonfocal.ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for a creatinine of 0.9.CBC was unremarkable. BNP was 2035. INR was 1.3 , and PTT was37.4.Of note , an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital onJuly , 2005 , showed an EF of 10% to 15% , moderate left atrialenlargement , right atrial enlargement , mild to moderate aorticregurgitation , mild MR and mild TR , and pulmonary arterypressures of 45.An ETT myoview performed at the outside hospital showed a largefixed defect inferiorly and inferolaterally as well as a mildischemia in the lateral wall.EKG at the outside hospital performed on July , 2005 , was withsinus rhythm; right bundle-branch block with T wave inversion inV1 through V4; Q waves in II , III , and aVF; first-degree AVblock; and a question of a left anterior fascicular block.A chest x-ray at the outside hospital on August , 2005 , was withbibasilar opacities with a question of atelectasis versuspneumonia.Admission EKG here on May , 2005 , was unchanged from theoutside hospital.Admission chest x-ray on done on May , 2005 , showedcardiomegaly and mild bilateral costophrenic angle blunting.HOSPITAL COURSE: Subjectively , this is an 82-year-old male witha history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fractionof 10% to 15% status post myocardial infarction , hypertension ,diabetes mellitus , and hypothyroidism who was transferred to theLas Health Network for an elective automaticimplantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient had no activeischemia. He does have a history of a myocardial infarction ,which was inferior in area. His ETT-MIBI was with mild lateralwall ischemia with a large fixed inferior and inferolateraldefect. The patient was continued on aspirin , ACE inhibitor , andstatin and restarted on his beta-blocker. A catheterization wasperformed on May , 2005 , which demonstrated a left dominantsystem and no significant left main or left anterior descendingartery lesions. A left posterior descending artery had an 80%lesion in the mid posterior descending artery. Ejection fractionwas estimated at 15% with global hypokinesis and dilated leftatrium and dilated left ventricle. The patient had elevatedwedge pressure of 42 and 2+ mitral regurgitation.2. Pump: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy.On admission , he was volume overloaded with a BNP of 2035. Onadmission , the patient was treated with Lasix , Isordil , ACEinhibitor , and digoxin. Hydralazine was added. Acatheterization on May , 2005 , demonstrated elevated leftheart-filling pressures. The patient was diuresed subsequentlywith more than 4 liters and was euvolemic upon discharge. Thepatient is currently euvolemic on p.o. Lasix to being slightlydry. Given increased CO2 but a normal BUN and creatinine , wehave changed the patient's Lasix dose to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 40mg p.o. q.p.m. upon discharge. Given the systolic bloodpressures in the 90s and 100s , the patient's lisinopril waschanged to 20 mg p.o. q.d. The patient is to be followed by VNAat home to monitor blood pressure.3. Rhythm: The patient was followed by EP. His admissionelectrocardiogram showed a right bundle-branch block with aquestion of left anterior fascicular block and a first-degreearteriovenous block. On October , 2005 , the patient becamesuddenly bradycardic to the 30s and 40s with nonsustainedventricular tachycardia x30 beats and a new second-degreearteriovenous block type 1. The patient was asymptomaticthroughout this. Zoll pads were placed , and atropine was put atthe bedside. On August , 2005 , the patient appeared to be back innormal sinus rhythm. On August , 2005 , a pacemaker with automaticimplantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed with cardiacresynchronization therapy as well. This was interrogated on June , 2005 , and the ??___?? were confined. The patient will followup with Dr. Valko in EP on July , 2005 , at 10:20 a.m. Thepatient is to avoid vigorous activity.4. Endocrine: The patient is with diabetes mellitus and wascovered with regular insulin sliding scale here. He was advisedto restart on his home dose of glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. upondischarge. The patients' history of hypothyroidism and thyroidfunction test is consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome. He wascontinued on levothyroxine at his home dose.5. Psychiatry: The patient is given trazodone and Ativan q.h.s.p.r.n. The patient's mental status was somewhat decreased on thenight of August , 2005 , status post automatic implantablecardioverter-defibrillator placement. He was not oriented totime. This later resolved by the evening of September , 2005.6. Genitourinary: The patient was noted to have bloody urineafter receiving heparin during the catheterization thoughtsecondary to Foley trauma. There were no clots; however , givensignificant hematuria , ??___?? Foley was placed and bladderirrigation was started. Urinalysis was negative. Urine was pinkcolored by the night of September , 2005. The Foley was discontinueddue to a leakage. This was not replaced given good urine output ,continued pink-colored urine , and no clots. The patient'shematocrit was stable throughout this.7. Prophylaxis: The patient was given pneumoboots given the newautomatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement andhematuria.8.

Total bypass time was 119 minutes , totalcrossclamp time was 69 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patientwas cannulated via the right axillary artery and left femoralvein. A sternotomy was performed while on coronary pulmonarybypass without incident. He was found to have a trileafletcalcified aortic valve , which was excised after transverseaortotomy. The patient did well intraoperatively , came offbypass without incident , was brought up to the Intensive CareUnit in normal sinus rhythm and stable condition.Postoperatively , the patient did very well. He was extubated andtransferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #1. He didreceive transfusion of 2 units packed red blood cells forpostoperative anemia. His Plavix , aspirin and Coumadin wasrestarted for his atrial fibrillation. Heath Uren was also foundto have an air leak from his chest tube and also did begin tohave some postoperative confusion on postoperative day #2. Hisnarcotics were discontinued. His chest tube air leak resolved ,and the chest tubes were removed without incident. Post-pullchest x-ray showed no pneumothorax. On postoperative day #3 , thepatient continued with his confusion requiring a sitter.Psychiatry was consulted and recommended to restart hispreoperative benzodiazepine and Haldol in the evening. He wasalso seen by the Infectious Disease Service for shingles andwas started on a seven-day course of acyclovir forpost-herpetic neuralgia. He required vigorous diuresis andpulmonary toilet with Mucomyst and vigorous chest physicaltherapy. The patient's mental status cleared. He no longerrequired a sitter.

Cardiovascular:A. Pump: The patient initially was in significant decompensatedheart failure. As a result , the patient was immediately startedon diuretics with torsemide IV 100 mg twice a day with a goal of-1 to -2 liters daily. Daily weights and strict I & Os weremonitored daily. The patient was also placed on 1 liter freewater restriction and 2 liters fluid restriction. Digoxin levelswere shown to be in normal range. The patient was continued ondigoxin , Isordil , and thiazides were held secondary to patient'shyponatremia. Over the hospital course , the patient'shyponatremia improved significantly and gradually back up in tothe 130s. The patient continued to diurese well initially with aweight of 83.5 kilograms. At the time of discharge , thepatient's weight was approximately 273 kilograms. The patientalso continued to show much improvement in terms of energy level.Subjectively , the patient felt better. Zestril was also slowlyadded to patient's CHF regimen. At the time of discharge ,Zestril 10 mg per day was added. A beta-blocker was also added ,specifically Coreg at 3.125 mg twice daily , Aldactone 25 mg oncedaily was also added to the regimen. In terms of diuresisinitially , the patient was on 100 mg b.i.d. p.o. torsemide and atone point was switched to Lasix drip as the patient was notresponding to diuretics. Eventually the patient was transitionedback to an oral regimen with torsemide ultimately at 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.Echocardiogram was also performed which showed significant mitralregurgitation with reversal of flow in the pulmonary venoussystem. As a result , there was consideration and discussionabout mitral valve replacement. The patient is amenable toprocedure performed by Dr. Mcgrue This will be discussed andcoordinated by his office and him. This will be a percutaneousprocedure possibly.The patient's electrolytes were monitored twice daily as thepatient was actively being diuresed. Electrolytes were repletedp.r.n.B. Rhythm: The patient has no active arrhythmias. However , thepatient's ICD and biventricular pacemaker was found to be towardsend of life and required replacement. As a result , although noturgent during this admission , ICD/biventricular pacer wasreplaced by Dr. Neuse on 4/20/05. The patient tolerated theprocedure very well with no complications. The patient's ICDpocket was checked for any signs of pocket hematoma or othercomplications. The patient is stable and new ICD/pacer isfunctioning properly. No signs of bleeding or infection.C. Ischemia: There are no active issues. EKGs demonstrated nosigns of cardiac ischemia. The patient was chest pain freethroughout the hospitalization.2. Endocrine: The patient's home regimen was held and thepatient was continued only on a insulin sliding scale after mealsand at bedtime. Fingersticks demonstrated good sugar control.Fingersticks were managed mostly between 100 and 120.3. FEN: The patient was on diabetic diet. The patient was alsochecked twice daily for electrolytes and repleted for magnesiumand potassium scale. Sodium was also monitored as the patientwas initially admitted for hyponatremia. As a result , allthiazides were held.4. Hematology: The patient had a home dose of Coumadin 5 mgMonday , Wednesday , Friday. The patient's regimen was continuedas inpatient and was slightly modified eventually toapproximately 2 to 2.5 mg once daily. INR was maintainedtherapeutic throughout the hospitalization. ICD replacementprocedure per Dr. Bjella The patient was continued with thefoal INR between 2.0 to 2.5.5. Psyche/Neuro: Continued patient's home regimen of Xanax ,Neurontin and pain medication to control chronic back pain.6. Prophylaxis: For DVT prophylaxis , the patient was on Coumadinwith therapeutic INR. For GI prophylaxis , the patient was placedon Nexium.Physical therapy consult was also called to evaluate thepatient's functional status. The patient also underwent regularphysical therapy sessions inhouse to improve functional status.ID: The patient's UA demonstrated possible evidence for urinarytract infection. This may also have contributed to patient'sdecompensated heart failure and also initial complaints offeeling weak. Urine culture demonstrated that the patient hadcitrobacter that was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. As a result ,the patient was started on a course of ciprofloxacin. Thepatient was also placed in isolation as the strain was resistantto gentamicin. The patient after treatment was taken off contactisolation. The patient was afebrile. Vital signs were stablewith no complaints of dysuria , chills , or fevers throughouthospitalization. Subsequent UA demonstrated evidence thaturinary tract infection was adequately treated.DISPOSITION:The patient to follow up with home cardiologist within one to twoweeks. After discharge , the patient will also follow up with Dr.Iturbe to discuss further treatment of mitral valveregurgitation. After Coumadin follow up and INR blood draws , thepatient will follow up with primary care doctor.eScription document: 4-9365056 EMSSten TelDictated By: ROSI , ALANAttending: STROBLE , WAYLON HERIBERTODictation ID 2453819D: 1/13/05T: 1/13/05

The patient denieschest pain , fevers or chills but does say that she has had sorethroat and a cough for approximately one week. The cough isproductive of clear frothy sputum. The patient reportscompliance with most of her medicines but states that she is nottaking Synthroid and lisinopril because these medications makeher feel bad. She also reports eating submarine sandwiches forthe past week secondary to difficulty shopping and doing hercooking at home. She does not measure her daily weights. Shestates that in addition to the Synthroid and lisinopril , she isunsure of her other medical regimen as she has run out of some ofher medicines at home.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:As above.ALLERGIES:Ampicillin causes a rash.SOCIAL HISTORY:The patient has two adult children at home and reports that shedrinks approximately 1/2-1 pint of ethanol over 2-3 days andbinges that occur approximately two times per month.ADMISSION DATA:Vital signs: Temperature 97 , pulse 76 , blood pressure 150s/80s.note that one read with a small cuff read a blood pressure of200/100 , this was believed to be secondary to inefficient cuffsize. Oxygen saturation 94% on room air. In general , thepatient is morbidly obese , in no acute distress , slowlyresponsive to questions with frequent staring episodes. HEENTexam was significant for mild pharyngeal erythema withoutexudates. Neck exam was significant for no lymphadenopathy.Jugular venous pressure was elevated although it is difficult toassess secondary to body habitus. Lungs showed clear breathsounds although a few crackles were present at the left base.Abdomen was morbidly obese but did have active bowel sounds andwas nontender. Extremities showed significant subcutaneous fattytissue , however , there was no pitting edema. Extremities werewarm throughout. Dermatologic exam was significant for dry skinand thin eyebrows. Neuro exam revealed 3+ biceps reflexesbilaterally. There was a question of slow relaxation phase.Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary redistribution. EKG wasunchanged from prior , and showed normal sinus rhythm with a firstdegree AV block , left axis deviation , left ventricularhypertrophy with poor R-wave progression and nonspecific T-waveabnormalities.Laboratory values on admission was significant for creatinine of0.8 , D-dimer was negative at 306 , BNP 2. White blood cell 6.9 ,hematocrit 43.6 , platelets 170 , 000 , magnesium 1.7 , potassium 3.2 ,INR 0.9 , PTT 29.3.INITIAL IMPRESSION:This is a 58-year-old woman with morbid obesity , dilatedcardiomyopathy and hypothyroidism in the setting of poor medicalcompliance , admitted with likely multifactorial dyspnea onexertion and mild congestive heart failure and decompensation.SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular:Pump: The patient presented with an elevated JVP in the settingof a negative BNP. However the clinical exam was more consistentwith mild failure and the patient was diuresed with 80 mg of IVLasix. She responded to this dose with good urine output andstable renal function test. However , secondary to stressincontinence and difficulty measuring JVP , the patient wasslightly over diuresed while inhouse resulting in an increasingBUN to creatinine ratio. On her final day of herhospitalization , all diuretics were held and the patient wasdischarged on her usual regimen of diuretics including Lasix 80mg once per day. The patient had been noncompliant with herlisinopril secondary to throat symptoms and reportedly somelightheadedness. Therefore she was changed to Cozaar 50 mg atthe time of discharge. The patient's discharge weight was 141.5kg and this was estimated to be dry weight for the patient atthis time.Rhythm: The patient had first degree AV block that was stablefrom old EKGs. She was monitored on telemetry throughout herhospital stay. There were no significant events on telemetryduring this hospitalization.Ischemia: Rule out MI protocol was initiated in the ED secondaryto vague symptoms. This was continued and the patient ruled outwith serial negative cardiac enzymes x 3. there was nosuggestion of ischemic by ECG criteria as well.2. Endocrine: The patient has a long history of noncompliancewith her thyroid hormone replacement and was clearly hypothyroidon this admission. However , secondary to difficulty with blooddraws , thyroid function tests that were ordered were not obtainedon this admission and should be obtained as an outpatient in thenear future. the patient was encouraged to continue taking herthyroid medicine as this may help improve her overall functionalstatus in addition to her cardiomyopathy.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. , potassium chloride20 mEq p.o. q.d. , Prozac 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ventolin 2 puffsaerosol as needed , levothyroxine 225 mcg p.o. q.d. , multivitamin tabletp.o. q.d. , Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mgp.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Flonase 1-2 puffs in thenose twice a day , Advair Diskus one puff twice a day , Aldactoneone tablet p.o. q.d. , atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.FOLLOWUP PLANS:The patient will have a followup in SNOWEST HOSPITAL clinic with her primarycare provider , the day following discharge , since Wednesday8/6/05. at this time , routine chem-7 can be obtained toevaluate for improvement in renal function and electrolytestatus.

Hypertension.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:Mr. Barriger is a 73-year-old gentleman who is a restrained driverin a single car motor vehicle collision , in which the car wentoff the road at a moderate rate of speed ( approximately 45 milesan hour ) , and struck a telephone pole. There are no skin marksnoted at the scene. There was airbag deployment , and the patientwas wearing a seatbelt. The patient reports feeling "fine" priorto the motor vehicle collision. However , he has no recollectionof the motor vehicle collision itself , and the next thing heremembers is waking up and finding the airbag is deployed , andbeing in severe pain. He does remember EMS arriving.Upon arrival of the EMS , he was found to have a heart rate of 30in a third-degree AV block. The patient denies any chest pain ,shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting before the motor vehiclecollision. He also denies any fevers , chills , night sweats ,shortness of breath , headaches or visual changes either before orafter. He had no recent changes in any doses of his medications.He was also complaining of knee pain.ED COURSE: In the Emergency Department , he was seen by theTrauma Team. A full dictation of the Emergency Departmentcourses has been completed. Please see the computer for furtherdetails of this dictation. However , in brief , he had numerousCAT scans performed while in the Emergency Department. Theseincluded a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis , head , and chest.There was also a CT of the cervicothoracic and lumbar spine , withreconstructions performed. As well as plain x-rays films of thelower extremity as well a pelvis , C-spine , and chest. Ofsignificance , the plain films of the knee were negative. The CATscan of the chest demonstrated a right frontal periventricularhypodensity , which was thought to represent a subacute infarct.He was subsequently admitted to the Cardiac Step-Down Floor. Hewas seen by the Neurology Service ( Dr. Orban , who is theNeurology resident ) , who initially saw him.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Significant for myocardial infarction , eight years ago.

General appearance: He is a well-developed , well-nourished ,and well-hydrated male , in mildly acute distress. HEENT:Normocephalic and atraumatic. Extraocular motions are intact.Pupils are equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodationat 4 mm. The conjunctivae are pink and the sclera is anicteric.The oropharynx is significant for a slight bite mark on thetongue , without any active bleeding. There are moist mucosalmembranes. The neck is supple , and there is no midlinetenderness. There is no JVD. The chest is clear toauscultation. There is tenderness over the right ribs , as wellas mild sternal tenderness. The heart is regular rhythm ,although markedly bradycardiac. The abdomen is soft , nontender ,and nondistended. There are good bowel sounds in all fourquadrants. There is no CVA tenderness. The pelvis is stable torock. Extremities: There is tenderness in the abrasions overthe left knee. The left knee is in an immobilizer , at the timeof admission to the floor. He has full range of motion inankles , shoulders , and elbows bilaterally. There is decreasedrange of motion in the left knee. There is no bony tendernessalong any of the long bones of the upper or lower extremities ,with exception of the knee. Peripheral vascular , dorsalis pedis ,posterior , tibial , and radial pulses are all equal bilaterally.Neuro exam: He is awake , alert , and oriented x3. Cranial nervesII-XII are intact. Motor is 5/5 in the upper and lowerextremities bilaterally. Sensation is equal bilaterally , in theupper extremities , lower extremities , and face. There is nodysmetria or dysarthria. Finger-to-nose is fast and accuratebilaterally. There is no drift. Skin is warm , dry , andwell-perfused.LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:CT C-spine negative. CT head shows a right frontal subacuteinfarct. CT chest shows anterior fifth rib fracturesbilaterally. There was also some supraclavicular stranding alongthe left side , without any evidence of vessel injury. CT of theabdomen and pelvis is negative , except for a ruptured renal cyst.He was also incidentally noted to show diverticulosis , withoutany diverticulitis. The CT of the thoracic and lumbar spinesalso demonstrated no fractures , although there were incidentallynoted to be anterior osteophytes in numerous levels. CT of thechest demonstrated the rib fractures , but was otherwise negative.Laboratory , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate25 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 185 , and anion gap is 10 , ASTand ALT are 20 and 25 respectively. Alkaline phosphatase is 80.Lipase is 51. Calcium is 8.8 , the albumin is 4.6 , the CK is 89 ,CKMB is 3.6 , and troponin was less than assay. His serumtoxicology screen was negative for aspirin , Tylenol ,benzodiazepine , barbiturates , and tricyclics. Urine drug screenis also negative. PT , PTT , and INR were 13 , 25.8 , and 0.9respectively. CBC was significant for white count of 12.0 ,hemoglobin and hematocrit were 14.6 and 42.2 , and platelets are250. Urinalysis was negative.Review of the prehospital EKG demonstrated a complete( third-degree ) heart block. However , EKG done immediately uponadmission to the Trauma Bay demonstrated a bifascicular block ,with a rate in the 40s.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular: He was admitted to the Cardiac Step-DownUnit. He had Zoll pacer pads were placed upon his chest , andatropine remained at his bedside. He also had an additional Zollpacer pads , as well as the pacemaker standby at the bedside ,however , these were not needed , as he has completed asymptomaticwith his bifascicular block. He had serial enzymes , which wereperformed , he was ruled out for myocardial infarction. He wentto the Cardiac Cath Lab , which demonstrated some coronary arterydisease. Please see the dictated cardiology reports for thefindings of the Cath Lab. It was felt , however , this wasunchanged from prior studies. He also went to theElectrophysiology Lab. They were unable to induce anyventricular tachycardia or other dysrhythmias during theprolonged EP studies. He had a pacemaker inserted. Thepacemaker was followed by the Electrophysiology Service , and wasfound to be working adequately. The attending was Dr. Matt Duropan ,with the Electrophysiology Service. Dr. Caires with theCardiology Service saw him and was attending on record.2. Neurology: He was seen by the Neurology Service. So , thiswas under Dr. Edgardo Mccorison , the attending neurologist on thecase. He had an MRI/MRA performed of his head and neck. Thediffusion-weighted images demonstrated no evidence of anyabnormality. There was a region of increase signal intensity onthe T2 and FLAIR images , involving the vasoganglion , extendingthe corona radiata. Therefore , given the fact that signal wasseen on the T2 and FLAIR , not on the diffusion-weighted , it wasfelt that this was at least 10 days old. Therefore , this was notfelt to be either the cause nor an affect of the motor vehiclecollision. It was most likely represented an old CVA , which wasnot previously detected. Given the fact that the patientremained asymptomatic , and had a normal neurological exam , andradiographic data demonstrated that this infarct was more than 10days old , and this was not further addressed. An MRA of his headand neck demonstrated tortuous vertebrobasilar system. TheMRI/MRA of the neck was essentially normal , however , the leftbifurcation was thought to be without any significant stenosis.The right bifurcation is probably without significant stenosis ,however , could not be completed excluded. Given artifact , thiscould be further followed up with an outpatient venous duplex ofthe carotid arteries.3. Musculoskeletal: He was seen by the Orthopedic Service inthe Emergency Department at the time of the trauma , he ultimatelyhad an MRI that was performed of his knee. This showed tears ofthe medial and lateral menisci. There was no evidence offracture. He remained in a knee immobilizer. He saw PhysicalTherapy , which felt that further therapy would be indicated.With the impression of the Orthopedic Service that no acuteintervention was needed , and that he should follow-up with SportsMedicine or Orthopedics in approximately 3-4 weeks. In addition ,he was noted to have several rib fractures. The rib fractureswere felt to be the source of his pain , he continue to complainof some inspiratory pain throughout his chest. However , headamantly denied any pain throughout his chest wall uponinspiring. It was therefore felt that given the negative enzymesand the negative Cath , and the known rib fractures that the chestpain was strictly a result of a musculoskeletal pain. This painwas well controlled with the combination of Dilaudid andoxycodone. He was encouraged to take several deep breaths perhour to reduce the risk of atelectasis or pneumonia.4. Infectious Disease: There was no evidence of any acuteinfection. Of note , his white count was trending upwards , on thelast two days of admission. It was felt that this probablyrepresented stress , given all the recent procedures that weredone , including the catheterization and the electrophysiologystudies , rather than A2 infection. The chest x-ray was performedon the 25th , which demonstrated no infiltrate. This was reviewedwith an attending radiologist who reported low lung volumes.Otherwise , it was essentially negative. In addition , a repeaturinalysis was performed. The results are pending at the time ofdictation , however , will be followed up prior to the patient'sdischarge from the hospital. The patient appears well , andstates that he is feeling at his best since the accident.However , further workup for his white count is not performed atthe present time , however , the patient is informed , as the No Hospital and the discharge summary , which show that the patientseem to develop any evidence of infection that he should bereevaluated by a physician.5. Nutrition: The patient is able to eat without anydifficulty. He was eating regular house diabetic/cardiac diet.6. Hypercholesterolemia: He was continued on his Zocorthroughout the hospitalization.7. Prophylaxis: He was initially treated with Lovenox 40 mgsub-Q. q. day for a prophylaxis against DVTs. He is also onaspirin and Plavix for secondary cardiac and neurologicalprophylaxis. The Lovenox is discontinued , at the request of theElectrophysiology Service on the 24th.8. Endocrine: Given the numerous contrast studies , initiallyhis metformin was held. However , he was later restarted on this.In addition , he was continued on his glyburide and covered withsliding scale insulin. His blood sugar was never any significantproblem during his hospitalization.9. Disposition: The patient will be going to Missp Medical Center , instable condition. At the Rehab , he will continue to get physicaltherapy , which he has received in the hospital. It was felt thata short course of rehab would benefit the patient to allow him togo back living independently again. He will be discharged to theRehab in stable condition.MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE:1.

He hasappointments with Dr. Jc Rizzo , with Sports Medicine , Dr.Mac Gladwin in 10-14 days , and Dr. Aldo Helger in oneweek. Appointment with Dr. Mittman is in 3 weeks.ADDENDUM:Mr. Flentge had this pacemaker placed and was recoveringuneventfully. However , it was noted that he started havingincreasing white count. It was felt this was perhaps due to amild urine infection and was started on Levaquin. However , hestarted the next day complaining increasing pain in his knee. Atthis time , his white count had risen to 23 , 000. The knee wasobviously a concern for possible infection. His knee was warm ,was tender and was erythematous , compared to the contralateralside. As a result , the Orthopedic Service was again consulted.An arthrocentesis was performed on his left knee , this was a drytap; no fluid was able to be obtained. The subsequent day , hewas complaining of increasing pain , and the sed rate returned inthe 99 with a CRP of 190. The EP Service again evaluated thepatient , and felt that there was no evidence of any clearinfection from the pacer site. He continued to have no erythemaor tenderness around the pacer site. His chest x-ray wasessentially unremarkable. The next day ( 10/9/05 ) , he was seenby the Rheumatology Service , under Dr. Burris who also felt thiswas most likely to be prepatellar bursitis , probably septic innature , with a hematoma. He was asked to seen by the InfectiousDisease Service , under Dr. Ferlic and Lou MarzinskeHe was started on Ancef 1 gm q.8h. A PICC line will be placedlater today on the 5/15/05 and he will be discharged to rehab.Of note , he has been afebrile for more than 48 hours while on theAncef , and his white count has improved dramatically , into theapproximately 10000 range. He will continue to get IV Ancefq.8h. for an additional 12 days. New consultants on the case ,again Dr. Hempe and Dr. Bradford Mcguigan with InfectiousDisease , Dr Borde and Dr. Frances Thackston with Orthopedics and Dr.Gangwer with Rheumatology.eScription document: 5-5244513 ISCC: Claudio Shreve M.D.Ynealwell Healthcare MedicineCC: Fredrick Paciorek MDOH AthensphCC: Jonathan Counterman M.D.StockfayCC: Michel Patera MDLa AVer ColnCC: Brian Vecellio MDCardiac Arrhythmia Service Statesson Rankwarmchusetts Burg MedicalAndvirg E HaSon St. , Ette Villelau Jack , Indiana 51422CC: Thomas Skelly MDEtteADictated By: SHANDS , WILSONAttending: RAISBECK , CONRADDictation ID 6501655D: 5/2/05T: 10/1/05

Echocardiogram 7/7/2005: Ejection fraction 65-70% , mildconcentric left ventricular hypertrophy , aortic valve wasthickened , stenotic , peak gradient 58 ( mean 33 ) , AVA 0.74 , mildmitral regurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation( regurgitant velocity 3.2 m/s , pulmonary artery systolic pressure40+ right atrial pressure ) , trace-to-mild pulmonic regurgitation.2. Pulmonary function test 2/8/2006: FVC 31% , FEV1 23percent , FEV1/FVC 77%.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:On admission , 5/25/2006 , the patient's weight on admission was130 kg. Her vital signs are as follows , temperature 95.8 , pulse67 in atrial fibrillation , blood pressure 126/Doppler , thepatient had respiratory rate of 20 and an O2 saturation 95% on 4liters. In general , the patient was in no acute distress ,speaking in full sentences. Examination of the neck revealed JVPto the ear , weak/weight carotid upstrokes , no bruits.Cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rhythm with anS1 and weak S2. A 4/6 crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur washeard best at the right upper sternal border radiating to thecarotids. Lung examination revealed crackles that heard at theway up bilaterally with decreased breath sounds throughout. Thepatient's abdomen was obese , but soft and nontender. Examinationof her extremities revealed a parvus at tardus. Lower extremitypulses could not be palpated due to edema. The patient had 4+lower extremity edema. Examination of the left shin showederythema , pain , swelling with a 2 x 2 cm ulcer on the leftanterior shin. The ulcer appeared clean , dry and intact with nodrainage.STUDIES AT OUAH:1. EKG on 5/25/2006 showed atrial fibrillation at 63 beats perminute with a normal axis and poor R-wave progression.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. The patient presented in gross volume overload: We attemptedto diurese the patient with intravenous torsemide. Gradually ,the dose of torsemide was increased from 100 twice a day to 200twice a day. At the time of this dictation; however , thepatient's weight had decreased only to 124.6 kg. Her admissionweight on 7/15/2006 was 130 kg. However , this weight wasrecorded in the bed ( not standing ). Her first standing weightwas recorded on 8/19/2006 at 125 kg. Her lower extremity edemaonly mildly improved , however , at the time of this dictation , thepatient was able to put her shoes on , which she was unable to doprior to admission. During this diuresis , the patient'spotassium was repleted twice a day. She was also maintained onAldactone and acetazolamide ( for elevated CO2 levels ). Thepatient's lipid profile was measured during this hospitalizationand she had an LDL of 64. She was maintained on Zocor. Aspirincannot be administered due to the patient's drug allergy profile.From a rhythm standpoint , the patient remained in atrialfibrillation during this hospitalization through 5/18/2006. Shewas not anticoagulation , given her history of HIT and history ofgastrointestinal bleed on Coumadin.2. Pulmonary: The patient was maintained on BiPAP and Flonasethroughout her hospitalization. Her mental status was monitoredclosely given her previous MICU stay during her last admissionfor an elevated pCO2. However , the patient was alert andoriented x3 during her hospitalization.3. Renal: The patient's creatinine was stable at approximately1.1 during her diuresis through 10/30/2006.4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was maintained on Nexiumduring her hospitalization. Her hematocrit remained stable atapproximately 32.4.5. Endocrinology: The patient was maintained on Levoxyl and herhome NPH regimen.6. Infectious disease: The patient was given vancomycin forcellulitis on her left shin , which appeared to be improving asthe erythematous area was decreasing from 5/4/206 to10/30/2006. She was also started on gentamicin on 10/11/2006 forasymptomatic bacteriuria. The patient's urine culture on8/19/2006 greater than 100 , 000 colonies of pseudomonas.CODE STATUS: During this hospitalization , the patient reiteratedthat she is a full code. It was discussed with her that she isdifficult and in fact possibly and possible intubation. She wasone time intubated nasally. In any event , she wants all lifesaving measures performed.

She hadgastrointestinal surgery earlier this year , complicated by needfor wound infection with revision and debridement.Before her surgery , she could walk 20 minutes every morning , andwas very active. Over the last month , she has been limited byshortness of breath , substernal chest pressure , and an overalldecrease in exercise tolerance. She cannot walk across the roomwithout difficulty now. The pressure in her chest isnonradiating , is like a pressure rather than sharp , comesunpredictably with exertion , and is relieved by rest. Theshortness of breath accompanies the pain. The symptoms have beenbecoming more severe , and last night , she had rest shortness ofbreath and chest pain. This morning she came to the emergencydepartment because her visiting nurse for her wound care told hershe looked worse and more short of breath and that she shouldcome to the hospital. She has never had chest pain or shortnessof breath until a little over a month ago , but does takebeta-blockers for a few isolated episodes of nonsustainedventricular tachycardia that she had during her surgeryadmission. She sleeps on two pillows every night , which ischronic but does not get short of breath when flat. She deniesPND , palpitations , weight gain , swelling , or syncopal episodes.She is a nonsmoker , nondiabetic without high cholesterol that sheknows of. Her chest pain is 2/10 upon admission to the emergencydepartment and is now 0/10 with nitroglycerin. In the emergencyroom , she was given heparin , Plavix , aspirin , beta-blocker ,Plavix 300 , and oxygen.REVIEW OF SYSTEM:She does not have any gastrointestinal symptoms. Her pain isunrelated to eating. She has no cough , sputum production , and nohistory of blood clots. She does not have calf pain , and she hasno neurologic symptoms.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Status post bowel resection for diverticulitis , status postileostomy take down in 7/21 , status post closure of wound8/19/04 , and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during lasthospitalization.FAMILY HISTORY:Brother with angina at age less than 55.SOCIAL HISTORY:No tobacco.

Troponins upon admission: CK-MB1.4 , CK 63 , and troponin less than 0.10 , d-dimer 1408 , which ishigh , PT , PTT , and INR: PT was 17.1 and INR 29.1. ECG normalsinus rhythm. No ST changes. No Q waves. Chest x-ray: Noevidence of infiltrate. No evidence of congestive heart failuresuch as hilar prominence or effusion. Cardiac axilla wasslightly enlarged which is unchanged from her 10/29 films.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular:Ischemia: The patient was thought to have acute coronarysyndrome and was sent to have a left heart catheterization. Atcatheterization , she was found to have a large dyskinetic heart andsevere mitral regurgitation but no angiographically significantcoronary artery disease.Cardiovascular/pump: Echocardiogram on hospital day 2 showed mild tomoderate left ventricular enlargement with moderate mitralregurgitation and left atrial enlargement. There was only mildstructural mitral valve disease with MAC and leaflet thickening. Leftventricular systolic function was moderately to severely impaired.Management for congestive heart failure was pursued with the intention toreassess LV size , function and MR after optimizing medical therapy. Webegan diuresis at this time with 40 mg of IV Lasix. The patient came inat 64 kilograms and discharge weight and dry weight is 58.0 kilograms.The patient was also started on ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker as well asq.d. p.o. Lasix.Rhythm: The patient developed atrial fibrillation and atrialflutter during this hospitalization with rapid ventricularresponse. Heart rate was often into the 150s-160s. We were ableto eventually obtain control with Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,diltiazem p.o. 30 mg t.i.d. , which was then converted to 45 mgb.i.d. for an outpatient dosing. The patient was also started onCoumadin while in hospital. She will follow up in CoumadinClinic. The day after discharge , she will have labs drawn tocheck her INR. She will be on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.until INR becomes therapeutic.2.

She was noted to have a 2/6systolic murmur at the apex. Lungs were clear bilaterally.Pulse exam showed no palpable femoral pulses and biphasicdopplerable pulses bilaterally , DP and PT. Extremities showedbilateral mottling of all toes and an open 0.5 cm ulceration atthe base of the left fourth toe. All toes are exquisitely tenderto palpation. Sensation is decreased but equal bilaterally.HOSPITAL COURSE: This 75-year-old female vasculopath wasadmitted for further evaluation of her peripheral vasculardisease which was suspected to be contributing to her newulcerations and progressively worsening wrist pain as anexacerbating factor to likely atheroembolic phenomenon , statuspost coronary catheterizations earlier in the year. She wasplaced on broad-spectrum antibiotics and plan was made for an MRAto evaluate her anatomy. Unfortunately , the patient was unableto tolerate the MR and did experience some mental status changesthat prevented further noninvasive imaging , when she receivedsome narcotic following her hemodialysis round. Over the ensuingdays she required rather significant doses of Zyprexa and Haldolto contain agitation and delirium , as the patient would also getphysical and violent. This appeared to sedate her sufficientlyand over the following days , she did manage to calm significantlyand returned to her baseline mental status. She did appear veryemotionally labile throughout the rest of her stay and incrediblyremorseful for previous events. On 6/28/2006 , she was offeredan angiogram to delineate aortic and bilateral lower extremityrunoff anatomy. She did tolerate this well under simple IVconscious sedation. This showed chronic disease withcollateralization and very poor inflow to the bilateral feet withessentially one vessel run off on either side. After extensivediscussions with the patient and the patient's family , thepatient did agree to a left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypassgraft which was performed on 9/22/2006 without complication.Please see the operative note for further details. The patientdid tolerate the procedure well. By time of discharge , she wastolerating a regular diet and ambulating at baseline with herrolling walker. The pain was well controlled with minimalanalgesics that were not narcotic based. Cardiology wasconsulted during this time to optimize her prior to the OR. Herprimary cardiologist , Dr. Fugle did make some recommendationsincluding an echocardiogram that showed preserved ejectionfraction and no wall motion abnormalities. Her beta blockade wastitrated up and she was instructed to follow up with cardiology.She did tolerate hemodialysis throughout this time without unduedifficulty. She did on one occasion experience dyspnea followinghemodialysis that resolved of its own accord , no cardiac eventsor in evidence by EKG or by following cardiac enzymes. As thepatient was in stable condition and back to her baseline level ofactivity with very strong support at home , she was discharged tohome with services for wound checks and home safety evaluation.She was instructed to follow up with Dr. Sedlachek in one to twoweeks.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:1. Touchdown weightbearing on the left heel. The patient shouldnot keep legs in dependent position for more than 10 minutes at atime. She was to use the walker and a cane as instructed byphysical therapy.2. Legs are to be elevated as much as possible while sitting orlying down.3. All home medications were to be resumed except for Lopressor ,the dose of which had been changed by Dr. Huggins to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.4.

The patient's history of ccoronary artery disease began in 20 of June , when he developed substernalchest pain and underwent cardiac catheterization showing a 100%right coronary artery occlusion and 80% left anterior descendingocclusion , 70% proximal mid-left anterior descending lesion.Angioplasty was attempted , but was unsuccessful. In 1 of January , thepatient underwent a 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr.Melsheimer at Largdon Tar County Health with a left internal mammaryartery graft to the left anterior descending and right internalmammary artery graft to the posterior descending artery. However ,the patient had persistent incisional-type pain after his coronaryartery bypass grafting , but reported absence of his angina painpost-CABG. The patient underwent an echocardiogram post-CABGshowing normal left ventricular function with no regional wallmotion abnormalities , moderate effusion and mild left atrialenlargement 4.8 centimeters. The patient did well for 2 yearspost-CABG and underwent an exercise tolerance test in 15 of September ,exercising for 10 minutes and 0 seconds , maximum blood pressure170/100 , without chest pain or electrocardiogram changes ,considered to be a negative test. Since then , the patient has onlyhad sharp incisional pain not related to exertion , and he suffersno exertional angina and has no exercise limitation. Over the pastseveral months , the patient has gradually developed increasingexertional chest pain , increasing in both intensity and frequency ,to the point where it was occurring daily 1 week prior toadmission. The patient had been tried on multiple medications asan outpatient , however , because of issues ofnoncompliance/alternative belief system , it was unclear as to whatmedications the patient was actually taking. On the day ofadmission at 1:30 pm , the patient experienced severe 8 out of 10substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm with numbness andneck tightness , associated with dizziness and numbness on thescalp. The patient had no nausea , vomiting or shortness of breath ,but did suffer pleuritic pain in addition. The pain lasted 30minutes and was somewhat alleviated with rest and sitting in thesupine position on the way to the emergency room. At the Line Sumharca Center emergency room , the patient had worsening ofthe severity of his pain and was treated with sublingualnitroglycerin without relief , then morphine sulfate 4 milligramstimes 2 , Lopressor 5 milligrams times 1 , Nitro-Paste 1 inch withcomplete relief. An electrocardiogram on admission showed normalsinus rhythm , rate 80 , axis normal , no ST or T-wave abnormalities ,no Q-waves. The patient was admitted to the Prorouge En No Team.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was notable for albinism , he denies ulcers orgastrointestinal bleeds , he has a history of gout. HABITS includedformer heavy alcohol use , however , he denies use in the last 6months. The patient smoked cigarettes until 5 years ago.ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY wasnegative. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient is an appliancetechnician , he is married with 3 children. MEDICATIONS ONADMISSION revealed that the patient reported using Nifedipine-XL 30milligrams by mouth each day , enteric-coated aspirin 1 per day ,occasional Indocin and colchicine. His Inca Medical Center prescription also included Lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouthper day , and Isordil 20 milligrams by mouth 3 times , but thepatient denied taking these.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was mildly diaphoretic in noapparent distress. Temperature was 97 ,heart rate 78 , blood pressure 140/90 , respiratory rate 20 on 2liters of oxygen with 97% saturation. Skin was pale with red hair.Oropharynx was clear , extraocular movements were intact , pupilswere equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation. Carotidswere II+ bilaterally , there was a sternotomy scar on the chest , noevidence of infection. Lungs were clear to auscultation andpercussion without rales. Cardiac examination showed a soft S2 , S1was normal , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Abdomen was soft ,nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal examination showed normaltone , normal prostate , guaiac negative. Femoral pulses were I+bilaterally without bruits. Extremities showed II+ pulses in thedorsalis pedis , no edema , the deep tendon reflexes were normal.Neurologic examination was nonfocal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest x-ray showed clear lungs and nopneumonia or congestive heart failure.The electrocardiogram was as noted above. Sodium was 141 ,potassium 4.7 , chloride 112 , bicarbonate 24 , blood urea nitrogen26 , creatinine 1.8 , of note his baseline is 1.4 in 5-90 , glucose85 , white blood cell count 3.59 , platelets 125 , 000 , hematocrit44.5 , prothrombin time 12.7 , partial thromboplastin time 33.9 ,creatinine kinase 1 , 010 with 20 myocardial bands , LDH 222.Urinalysis was notable for 4+ proteinuria , no white cells , no redcells , 1 to 2 hyaline casts.HOSPITAL COURSE: The initial impression was the patient hadprobable coronary disease and probable unstableangina. He was admitted for intensive cardiac monitoring andcardiac catheterization. The patient was started on heparin at1 , 000 units per hour after bolus and sliding scale Nitro-Paste ,aspirin and Lopressor , and continued on Nifedipine. On the firstday of admission , the patient suffered 2 episodes of substernalchest pain and he was taken somewhat emergently to cardiaccatheterization which revealed a patent left internal mammaryartery graft to the left anterior descending , a patent rightinternal mammary artery graft except for small vessel disease inthe graft , and an essentially occluded posterior descending artery.The native coronary arteries showed occluded left anteriordescending proximally with filling from the left anteriordescending , circumflex showed a long 70% proximal lesion at thesecond obtuse marginal branch with 90% distal lesion. The rightcoronary artery was occluded proximally with right-to-rightcollaterals and left-to-right collaterals from the left anteriordescending. The patient was planned for a 2-step angioplasty andwas returned to the floor for stabilization while awaiting hisangioplasty. However , the patient suffered 2 episodes ofsubsternal chest pain despite being on intravenous heparin andintravenous nitroglycerin was initiated and the patient wastransferred to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit. The patientremained pain-free until he underwent angioplasty of the rightcoronary artery lesions with a result of 20% residual stenosis. Ofnote , the patient's creatinine kinase levels continued to trenddownward with the initial creatinine kinase being 1 , 010 being hismaximal value. The patient had no further chest pain after hisangioplasty , except for the baseline incisional pain which wasunrelated to exertion. The patient was monitored closely for 2days after angioplasty. Nitroglycerin was tapered off and thepatient was discharged on 9 of January Of note , the 4+ proteinuriawas unresolved at the time of discharge , because of his unstablecourse and transfers between the Intensive Care Unit and the floor ,we were unable to complete a 24-hour urine collection. This issuewill be addressed further.DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. MEDICATIONSON DISCHARGE were aspirin 325 milligrams by moutheach day , Lopressor 100 milligrams by mouth twice a day. CONDITIONON DISCHARGE was stable.

Her cardiac history began in 20 of April , when shepresented with new substernal chest pain. She ruled in for anon-Q-wave myocardial infarction , was treated with medical therapyand did well , until 5 of October , when she had progressive exertional chestheaviness and shortness of breath. An exercise tolerance test waspositive at that time , and echocardiogram showed good leftventricular function. She had a cardiac catheterization whichshowed a 90% left anterior descending , 75% first diagonal , 75%second diagonal. The cardiac catheterization was complicated byfoot cellulitis , sepsis and deep vein thrombosis and she was in andout of the hospital for several months recovering. Given this , shewas hesitant to undergo further procedures and was treated withmedical therapy. The patient did fairly well with stable anginaand shortness of breath , until 1 year prior to admission when shehad slowly progressive increase in her chest heaviness andshortness of breath , limiting her activities. Her anginal patternhas not changed recently in a significant manner , but over the lastseveral months her pain has been extremely limiting to heractivities , and thus she presented for cardiac catheterization anda question of revascularization. The patient has stable 2-pilloworthopnea , she has claudication with a 10-minute walk relieved withrest. The patient denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Her chestpain is not associated with diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting ,radiation , or syncope. It is associated with upper chestheaviness , shortness of breath and warmth in the chest and neck.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant for coronary artery disease asabove , diabetes times 20 years on insulin for the last 10 years ,complicated by neuropathy and retinopathy , hypertension ,hypercholesterolemia , breast cancer status post left mastectomy andradiation therapy in 1979 , peripheral vascular disease ,musculoskeletal pain syndrome , she had a positive ANA previously onwork-up , but her symptoms are fluctuant and easily controlled.History also included deep vein thrombosis during her previouscardiac catheterization , cataracts , status post cholecystectomy andappendectomy. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Nifedipine-XL 60milligrams each day , Inderal 20 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day ,insulin 45 units of NPH each morning , sublingual trinitroglycerinas needed. FAMILY HISTORY was negative for coronary artery diseaseand diabetes. ALLERGIES were no known drug allergies. SOCIALHISTORY revealed the patient lives with her daughter in Cu I , she does not smoke nor drink.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , she was in no apparentdistress. Vital signs were within normallimits. Head and neck examination was unremarkable. Lungs wereclear to auscultation. Cardiac examination revealed regular rateand rhythm with a I/VI systolic ejection murmur , no S3 , no S4 , nojugular venous distension. Abdominal examination was nontender ,nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly , normoactive bowel sounds , nomasses. Extremities showed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema.Neurologic examination was within normal limits.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , platelets were 318 , 000 ,hematocrit 41.7 , white count within normallimits , prothrombin time 11.2 , partial thromboplastin time 31.1 ,electrolytes were unremarkable. Chest x-ray showed no infiltratesor effusions. The electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm at 70with axis 0 , intervals within normal limits , left atrialenlargement , T-wave inversion in III , but no acute ST-T wavechanges.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and underwent cardiaccatheterization which showed a 90% proximal leftanterior descending stenosis , 70% mid-left anterior descending , 90%first diagonal , 70% second diagonal and 100% obtuse marginal branchstenosis. The right coronary artery was not cannulated , but lookednormal with what dye could be injected. A percutaneoustransluminal coronary angioplasty was planned the following day fordilatation of her serial left anterior descending lesions , however ,the patient had significant bleeding the night before , when arisingafter her cardiac catheterization and the decision was made to waituntil over the weekend to do the percutaneous transluminal coronaryangioplasty. On Monday , the patient underwent percutaneoustransluminal coronary angioplasty with successful dilatation of theserial left anterior descending lesions , both down to 30% , and didwell. Sheaths were removed the next day and the patient wasdischarged.DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. CONDITION ONDISCHARGE was stable. The patient is to FOLLOW-UPwith her Egele Hospital cardiologist. MEDICATIONSON DISCHARGE were the same as her admission medications.Dictated By: DENIS J.

He was admitted for transplantwork-up , right heart catheterization and optimization of hismedical treatment. He initially developed symptoms approximatelysix years prior to admission with complaints of dyspnea andorthopnea. His chest x-ray at that time demonstrated cardiomegalyand ultimately an echocardiogram demonstrated dilatedcardiomyopathy. In 1992 , a catheterization was performed withclean coronary arteries by report. In February of 1994 , he had a"cerebrovascular accident". He was on Coumadin at that time. Hissymptoms included right hand and face anesthesia and hemiplegiawhich lasted only a few seconds and were self resolved. A CT wasnegative by report. He was started on Coumadin subsequently. InFebruary of 1994 , he had an echocardiogram which demonstrated aleft ventricular end diastolic diameter of 6.2 cm and ejectionfraction of 20%. There was no thrombus seen. There was 2+ mitralregurgitation. There were no regional wall motion abnormalities.He was doing fairly well at home with medical management withoutany admissions for congestive heart failure until earlier thisyear. He began to have worsening symptoms following a viralillness in October of 1997. At that time an echocardiogram inOctober of 1997 demonstrated a probably left ventricular thrombusand ejection fraction of 12%. His Lasix dose was increased and hisAtenolol dose was decreased. He improved and in October of 1997 , hewas able to participate in activities such as sledding and skatingwith only occasional chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion. InOctober of 1997 , an exercise tolerance test was performed which hewent 11 minutes. Maximum heart rate was 148. His rate pressureproduct was 18 , 000 and the peak oxygen consumption was 20.4. Atthe time nitrates were added to his regimen. His Atenolol wasincreased. However , nitrates were discontinued because of headacheand insomnia. Now , over the prior one to two months , proceedingadmission , he has had worsening symptoms with orthopnea , dyspnea onminimal exertion with less than one flight of stairs , decreasedappetite. His weight is stable , but it is felt to be a decrease inthe body amount with an increase in fluid weight. He has nocturnalshortness of breath and dyspnea. There is no syncope. He was seenby Dr. Parker Willy and was felt to be at that time a class fouron the Thyna 1 , Cuse , Nebraska 41604 . His Lasix was increased and hewas referred for admission.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for orthopnea as well as paroxysmalnocturnal dyspnea four out of seven nights.There is no nocturia. His exercise tolerance is approximately oneflight of stairs with moderate shortness of breath. He complainsof nausea and anorexia without vomiting. He also has insomnia anderectile difficulties. He has a 6 lb. weight loss over the weekprior to admission following an increase in outpatient diureticuse. His baseline weight was 175 lbs. One month ago , it was 165lbs. and the day of admission , it is 155 lbs.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for cardiomyopathy as above , gunshotwound to his chest and head at the age of 14and motor vehicle accident , Hepatitis B. He has had fourcolonoscopies in the past and has had no polyps.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for appendectomy and a ganglioncyst in his right wrist.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 )Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5 )Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) Kay Ciel 10 mg p.o. q. day. 7 )Multivitamins one p.o. q. day.ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a sales representative for a food broker.He lives with his wife and three daughters inY He was a former smoker who quit in 1984. Previously , hehad smoked one to two packs per day for twelve years. He continuesto use alcohol and drinks approximately six beers per week.FAMILY HISTORY: His father is 70 years old. His mother is 68. Hehas a sister with colon polyps and a brother whois healthy. His family history is otherwise notable for familialcolon cancer and polyposis.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Weight 72 kg , afebrile , heartrate 78 , blood pressure 95/71 , respiratoryrate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. HEENT isnormocephalic , atraumatic. Oropharynx revealed multiple fillings ,but there is no abnormality. His neck is supple with nothyromegaly , carotid bruits or jugular venous distension. Hisjugular venous pressure is 6 cm. His chest is clear. His cardiacexamination is regular rate and rhythm with an S3 as well as rightventricular impulse palpable and audible. His abdomen was soft ,non-tender with normal active bowel sounds. He had no bruits. Hisliver is 12-14 cm and 1 cm below the right costal margin. Thereare no masses. His extremities were warm and well perfused.Neurological examination revealed a mild right facial asymmetry ,but otherwise , his neurological examination is non-focal.LABORATORY: Laboratory evaluation on admission was notable for asodium of 133 , creatinine 1.2. Liver function testsare notable for a bilirubin of 1.7 and 0.7. His complete bloodcount is unremarkable. His INR was 1.4. His urinalysis wasunremarkable. Pulmonary function tests on admission included anFVC of 81% of predicted and FEV1 of 78% of predicted and anFEV1/FVC ratio of 97% of predicted. His DLCO is 90% of predicted.EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm at 80 with first degreeatrioventricular block. His PR interval is 0.226. His QRSinterval is 0.10 and his QTC is 0.401. There was a left anteriorhemi-block. His axis is -49 degrees. There was left atrialenlargement. There was poor R-wave progression. There wereflipped T-waves across the precordium. There was an increase inleft atrial size since October of 1997 , otherwise no acute changes.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 42 year-old gentleman with idiopathicdilated cardiomyopathy now presented withworsening functional status over the past few months as well asrecent fluid overload necessitating increase in Lasix. There was aquestion of patient non-compliance especially given his currentalcohol use which raises the question of psychologic readiness forcardiac transplant at this time. Following admission , the patientunderwent a right heart catheterization which demonstrated rightatrial pressure of 7 , right ventricular pressure of 55/12 , PApressures of 58/32 , mean wedge pressure of 30 , arterial pressure atthe time was 113/74 with a mean of 90. Additionally , by Fick , hiscardiac output was 2.85 with a cardiac index of 1.49 , pulmonaryvenous resistance of 280 and a systemic venous resistance of 2 , 330.Because of this markedly high SVR and a borderline PVR , he wasstarted on intravenous nitrates with intravenous Nitroprusside witha significant decrease in his SVR as well as his PA pressures.This was felt to be a significant enough reduction in his pressuresto suggest that he would be a successful transplant candidate.Therefore , he was transitioned to oral nitrates and started onIsordil by mouth. However , he developed intolerance to nitrateswith severe headaches and ultimately all nitrates werediscontinued. He was subsequently managed only on afterloadreduction. His Analopril was held and he was started on Captoprilwhich was titrated up with good maintenance of his decrease inpressure. Additionally , he was started on Losartan for furtherafterload reduction which he tolerated well without orthostaticsymptoms. His Lasix was gradually increased and he continued tohave quite a significant improvement symptomatically with nofurther orthopnea in the hospital. Further parts of the cardiactransplant work-up were undertaken including PPD and controls whichwere placed. There was no reaction to either PPDs or controls at72 hours. He had a B12 and folate level drawn which were withinnormal limits. His thyroid function test demonstrated a TSH of 1.9and all other parameters were within normal limits. Digoxin levelon discharge was maintained in a therapeutic range. Hepatitispanel was sent and he was negative for Hepatitis B antigen orantibody as well as Hepatitis C antibodies. 24 hour urinecollection was obtained for creatinine and his creatinine clearancewas at 88 at 24 hours. Pulmonary function tests were as notedabove. He was seen by Dental Consult and was felt to have a fewminor restorative needs which could be taken care of by hisoutpatient dentist , but he was dentally cleared otherwise for atransplant. Subsequent to his medical changes and his transplantwork-up , he was restarted on his Coumadin and was discharged whenhis INR had become greater than 2 with a target range of 2 to 2.5planned. Echocardiogram was performed on October , 1997 whichdemonstrated 1+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+ mitral regurgitation ,severely dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 20%.There was diffuse severe hypokinesis and apical akinesis. Therewas evidence of echo contrast within the left ventricle suggestinga clot. There was moderate left atrial enlargement.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stablecondition. He was markedly improved froma symptomatic point of view on discharge.FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Royce Mcumber inthe Tho Medical CenterMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Captopril 75 mg p.o. q.i.d. 2 )Potassium Slow Release 10 mEq p.o. q.day. 3 ) Lasix 80 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Multivitamins one p.o. q.day. 5 ) Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day. 6 ) Losartan 15 mg p.o. q.day. 7 ) Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day on even days and 0.125 mgp.o. q. day on odd days.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.Dictated By: LAMAR HOYSOCK , M.D.Attending: KIP R.

Congestive heart failure.2. Diastolic dysfunction.3. Hypertension.4. Diabetes mellitus.5. Serratia UTI.6. Chronic renal dysfunction.7. Dyslipidemia.8. Coronary artery disease.9. Mild pulmonary hypertension.10. Mitral regurgitation.ALLERGIES:Penicillins.BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:The patient is a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who presents withshortness of breath and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea forapproximately three weeks. He has a history of coronary arterydisease with an MI in 1994 and four-vessel CABG with subsequentlyplaced five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis ,hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baselinecreatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) ,hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. Heis presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea ,and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightnesswithout radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent.He presents after coming to an outside hospital with three tofour days of these worsening symptoms. He was transferred toBaspit Hospital where he received most of hiscardiac care. The patient had these worsening heart failuresymptoms after a trip to I Hwy , Ny Vale , Michigan 34152 , some dietary indiscretion anda five-pound weight gain. He has had no syncope , palpitations ,but has had some mild nausea without emesis. At the outsidehospital when he presented , his EKG showed a baseline leftbundle-branch block and had a troponin of 0.13. He was givensome Lasix and had echocardiogram , had initially revealed anejection fraction of 35%. He was transferred to Me Ale Firstray Hospital , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as aheparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeatechocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior walldistal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction andmoderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. This is consistent withan echocardiogram that he received in 1/8 . Uponpresentation , the patient was afebrile , had a heart rate of 82 ,blood pressure of 138/64 and was sating 96% on 5 liters of nasalcanula. His jugular venous pressure was 7 cm. His lungs hadrales bilaterally , approximately half way up. He had nodullness. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the leftaxilla. He had no S3 , and no S4. His abdomen was mildlydistended. He had no fluid waves and positive bowel sounds. Hisextremities were warm. He had no pedal edema and 1+ dorsalispedis pulses bilaterally. EKG at Baneers Hospitalrevealed a dual chamber pacemaker with left bundle-branch patternand no significant ST wave changes and an occasional PVC.ADMISSION LABORATORIES:Significant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a BUN of 76 , potassium of5.3 , his hematocrit was 29.4 , and PT-T was 56 on heparin drip.BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Ischemia. The patient has an extensive history of coronaryartery disease. He is maintained on aspirin , Plavix , low dosebeta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ACE inhibitor and statin.He initially came in with a troponin of 0.13 , which was felt asdemand ischemia related to systemic hypertension and pulmonaryhypertension. His enzymes trended down and were negative afterthe initial check. Eventually , the patient received 48 hours ofintravenous heparin as well as IV nitroglycerin and was chestpain free. At this point , he received an Adenosine MIBI nuclearstudy , which revealed a known distal anterior wall scar with avery small surrounding region of reversible ischemia that wasfelt to be nonrevascularizable. He was maintained on optimummedical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterizationin this gentleman who had already had previous history of renaldysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye loadwas not warranted nor indicated at this time. By discharge , hewas ambulating halls and was chest tightness free. Coronaryartery disease was felt to be a noncontributory factor to his CHFexacerbation.2. Pump. The patient had an ejection fraction of 45% uponadmission with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. He wasinitially diuresed approximately 3 liters with a combination ofLasix and Natrecor. At this point , his pulmonary edema hadresolved and his oxygen requirement was decreased. Given thefact of his tenuous renal status , we wanted to avoid furtherdiuresis or after-load reduction until we knew exactly what hisright and left heart filling pressures were. The patient wastaken to the Cardiovascular Diagnostic Laboratory and received aright heart catheterization. His pulmonary capillary wedgepressure was determined to be 16 and his pulmonary arterypressure 56/18. His RA pressure was 8. There was some initialfalse elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cathlab , and the patient was transferred for 48 hours of tailoredtherapy to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a pulmonary arterycatheter in place. At this point , his after-load reduction wasmaximized with combination of hydralazine and Isordil with goodeffect. His creatinine decreased with after-load reduction to2.7. His symptoms improved and we were able to diurese another 2liters of the patient. By discharge , the patient was actuallybecoming hypertensive again and he was started on amlodipine , acalcium channel blocker , which he has tolerated in the past. Ofnote , the patient has been exposed to ACE inhibition in the pastand is currently not on an ACE inhibitor. In the past , he hadhad a rise in his potassium to 5.5 on ACE inhibition. On anoutpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient havea trial of ACE or ARB to optimize his after-load reduction andneurohormonal activation with his heart failure. The patient'sheart failure regimen includes standing Lasix , carvedilol ,Isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomaticimprovement.3. Rhythm. The patient has a dual-chambered pacemaker. He wasmaintained on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. Hiselectrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker.He had a few rounds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia lessthan 8 beats every time during his hospital stay. The patient isnot at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricularpacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45% , even if hisQRS interval is greater than 150 ms.4. Pulmonary. Given the fact that the patient had a normalpulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary arterypressures , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal diseasewas undertaken. He had a high resolution chest CT , which showedmild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent withpulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process. He alsohad pulmonary function tests. Pulmonary function tests revealedan FVC of 1.88 liters and an FEV1 of 1.33 liters. This gives anFEV1 to FVC percent of 71%. He has both decreased FVC and FEV1 ,but an FEV1 and FVC percent that is most consistent with a mildrestriction. His lung volumes are approximately 50% predictedsuggestive of a restrictive process and his DLCO both correctedand uncorrected are 50% predicted. His corrected DLCO is 13.5.It is unclear if the patient has underlying restrictive lungdisease given the absence of definitive interstitial process onhigh resolution chest CT. A more likely explanation for thesefindings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequatediuresis with his congestive heart failure. The patient wassating 98% on room air at the time of discharge.5. Endocrine. The patient has very difficult to controldiabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both NPH and Lisprosliding scale while in house. He was briefly hypoglycemic duringhis initial hospital course because of a urinary tract infection.This resolved after approximately 24 hours of holding hislong-acting insulin and giving him glucose replacement therapy.He was euglycemic on 15 and 10 of NPH in the a.m. and p.m.respectively as well as a Lispro scale at the time of discharge.Furthermore , the patient was found to have a TSH of 0.219 as wellas a normal T4 , this is suggestive of clinical hypothyroidism ,which is consistent with over replacement with Synthroid such asmaintenance Synthroid dose is decreased from 75 mcg to 60.5 mcgand we recommend a TSH to be checked in late February 2004.6. Renal. The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiencypresumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension. Hehas had adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with acreatinine bump to nearly 7. We wanted to avoid as much contrastdye as possible during this hospital stay because of his renalinsufficiency. We ended up re-dosing his digoxin to three timesweekly from every other day because of the dig level of 0.19.His creatinine was 2.7 and falling at the time of discharge andhis BUN was 67. He was making good urine and had no evidence ofresidual urinary tract infection.7. Infectious disease. Upon presentation , the patient after aFoley was placed became a little delirious and hypoglycemic.Urine cultures grew out greater than 100 , 000 colonies of Serratiamarcescens and he was given a 14-day course of renally dosedlevofloxacin with good resolution of his symptoms.8. Neuropsych. The patient has a history of depression and hadsome mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection ,which resolved with p.r.n. Zyprexa as well as treating of theunderlying condition. Psychiatric Service was consulted and feltlike he had a resolving medical delirium and there is noindication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at thistime. ( His mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contributedto his low mood as apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman ofthis age is not uncommon. )9. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Nexium for GIprophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.CODE STATUS:The patient is full code.The patient was consulted by both Physical Therapy andOccupational Therapy who felt that acute rehabilitation would bewarranted at this time.DISPOSITION:The patient was discharged in stable condition on room air andwas chest pain free to the Irbar Medical Center The patient's health care proxy is his wife , Mrs.Blake Maker , whose phone number is ( 158 ) 000-3426. He willbe followed by Dr. Valentine Cloer at As Medical CenterSchedule appointments with Dr. Jo ( 703 ) 219-1739. The patient's primary care physician is Dr. Arthur Widener at ( 865 ) 227-2987. The patient should be maintained on afluid-restricted diet of less than 2 liters of fluid total.

Pt satted in mid 90's on RA while awake and upright. Pulmonarythought pt likely with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea( central +/- obstructive ). Pt tried on empiric bipap ( 4/9 ) the nightprior to d/c and felt that he slept much better. Of note pt used thenasal mask in house but has the full mask at home. Tried to set up ptfor home bipap but is not eligible unless has another sleep study.Communicated this with pt's PCP who will set up repeat sleep study innear future.

OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEAPROCEDURES: SEE HOSPITAL COURSEHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old gentlemanwith a past medical historysignificant for diabetes mellitus , obesity , coronary artery diseasestatus post coronary artery bypass grafting and pacemaker placementin 1996 and 1999 respectively , who presented on 7/16/2000 with afour day history of cough , fevers , chills , myalgias and left eyepain. The patient also noted over the course of four days prior toadmission , that his p.o. intake had been decreasing. He had beenexperiencing nausea and vomiting without diarrhea and fevers to 103degrees. On the day of admission the patient noted the suddenonset of vision loss in his left eye associated with redness andpain. In the Emergency Room the patient was given Diamox , aspirinand nitropaste in response to T-wave inversions anteriorly on hiselectrocardiogram. In addition , the patient was cultured andstarted on broad spectrum antibiotics including Ceftriaxone ,azithromycin and Gentamycin.PHYSICAL EXAM: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.2 , heart rate 60 ,blood pressure 118/78 , 98% oxygen saturation on 100percent face mask. HEENT: OS with hazy , edematous cornea ,moderately dilated fixed pupil with erythema and injectedconjunctiva. NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy , no carotidbruits and no jugular venous distention. LUNGS: Bibasilar scantcrackles. CHEST: Distant heart sounds. Regular rate and rhythm.No murmurs , rubs or gallops. S3 , loud S2. EXTREMITIES: Minimaledema , no cyanosis. 2 plus peripheral pulses. ABDOMEN: Obese ,soft , nontender and nondistended. Normal bowel sounds. Difficultto assess. NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal. RECTAL: Guaiac negativebrown stool.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Chemistry panel showed BUN 74 ,creatinine 2.8 ( baseline 1.0 ) ,otherwise normal. Albumen 2.4 , liver function studies otherwisenormal. CK 169 , troponin 1.7 , CBC showed a white blood cell countof 5.5 , hematocrit 33 , platelets 51. Electrocardiogram showedpaced rate of 60 with T-wave inversions of V1-V6. Chest x-rayshowed cardiomegaly with vascular redistribution. No focalinfiltrates noted. CT of the head showed no evidence of acutebleed. Urinalysis essentially negative.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Infectious disease: The patient wasinitially treated with broad spectrum antibioticsin the Emergency Room and was rapidly noted to be hypotensive witha systolic blood pressure in the 72. The patient was hydratedaggressively and consistently pan cultured. The patient began tospike fevers from 100 to 101 range. On the second hospital day ,the patient grew 4/4 bottles of what turned out to be Group B streptococcus.The patient's antibiotics were changed to Penicillin and Gentamycin. Atransesophageal echocardiogram was performed on the day ofadmission and did not demonstrate any vegetation , however withpersistent high spiking fevers , sepsis and 4/4 blood culturebottles , repeated blood cultures growing GBS the patient had repeattransesophageal echocardiogram. This demonstrated a 1.5x1.0centimeter vegetation on the anterior annulus of the tricuspidvalve and it was also noted to be hitting the pacemaker wire thoughnot fixed to it. Of note , the bubble study on the echocardiogramwas negative for patent foramen ovale.The patient presented complaining of left eye pain and loss ofvision on the night of admission in the Emergency Room , theophthalmologist saw the patient and determined that the patient hadan elevated pressure. The elevated pressure was treated and heresponded well by the following day. At that time the patient'seye was aspirated and noted to also be infected by GBS. Thepatient was injected intraocular with Vancomycin at that time.Unfortunately the patient continued to spike fever despiteappropriate therapy for his GBS and his eye appeared to beworsening with continued erythema , conjunctival edema and apurulent exudate. It was determined that the patient would requireenucleation which he underwent on 5/10/2000.The patient also had a right lower extremity cellulitis during hishospital course. This was treated with a ten day course ofdicloxacillin and resolved without complications. The patient'scourse was complicated by persistent fevers despite appropriateantibiotic therapy and left eye enucleation. An extensive work upwas undertaken to evaluate the fevers including evaluation forpossible epidural abscess , psoas abscess and infected joints. Noneof these proved to be a source. The patient underwent multiplejoint aspirations ( see musculoskeletal section below ) without clearevidence of infection. The patient also underwent a tagged whiteblood cell scan which demonstrated increased uptake in the leftshoulder , manubrium , right knee , left ankle and mid shaft of theleft tibia. These were interpreted both on the initial views anddelayed views as consistent with acute inflammation but notdiagnostic of infection. As mentioned above the patient was alsotreated for cellulitis and underwent left eye enucleation. Thepatient's fever curve trended down throughout the hospital stay andon the day prior to admission , the patient underwent a repeattransesophageal echocardiogram to ensure that there was nomyocardial abscess. There was no evidence of any abscess and thevegetation was no longer visible. It was felt that the low gradefevers were secondary to ongoing inflammation but no acuteinfectious process at the time of discharge. The patient's lastpositive blood culture was 4/3/2000.Of note , there was concern that the patient's fever could besecondary to a drug reaction. Therefore once the infectious workup was completed , the Penicillin was changed to Vancomycin. Hisgram positive coverage will need to be continued for four weeksafter his left eye enucleation.2. Ophthalmology: As described above , the patient presented withleft eye pain and vision loss. It was felt from the time ofpresentation that the patient would not recover vision in his lefteye. The patient was treated initially for his elevated pressureand then the following day his eye was aspirated and injected withVancomycin. Ultimately the patient had left eye enucleation. Thepatient's eye healed well through the remainder of his hospitalcourse and does not appear to be a source of infection thereafter.The patient's extraocular muscles were left intact with the thoughtof placing a prosthesis at a later date.3. Cardiovascular: On admission the patient was noted to haveT-wave inversions anteriorly on his electrocardiogram. However itrapidly became clear that his pacemaker was malfunctioningdemonstrating only occasional pacing spikes. By 6/24/2000 thepacemaker was no longer capturing or sensing. As mentioned above ,the wire did not appear to be incorporated in the vegetation notedon the tricuspid valve however it did appear that the vegetationwas hitting the pacemaker wire with systole and diastole. On6/13/2000 the patient underwent pacemaker explantation withoutcomplications.The indication for pacemaker placement had been for bradycardia.There was some concern throughout the patient's hospital coursethat the patient would become bradycardic without his pacemaker inplace however this never manifested as a problem. He diddemonstrate some runs of ventricular tachycardia during the earlyphase of his hospital course but this resolved as his sepsisresolved. He did have one episode of supraventricular tachycardiathought to be 1-1 conduction of his atrial arrhythmia. HisLopressor was increased in response to this and the patient wastolerating this dose without episodes of bradycardia orhypotension.The patient as mentioned above , underwent a transesophagealechocardiogram at the time of admission which demonstrated anejection fraction of 35 percent , apical hypokinesis , moderatelydilated right ventricle with moderately depressed systolicfunction. Mild inferior vena cava dilatation consistent withelevated right heart filling pressures. The patient's cardiacfunction appeared to be stable throughout his hospitalization. hedid rule out for myocardial infarction at the time of admission.4. Musculoskeletal: One of the patient's major presentingcomplaints was significant arthralgia and myalgia. It was thoughthat along with left ophthalmitis , the patient could have septicpolyarthritis. The patient underwent several arthrocentesis by therheumatology service. Though the fluid did demonstrate elevatedwhite blood cell count it was never clear that these were acutelyinfected. There were no bacteria on gram stain or culture. Thepatient's right knee continued to be tender , erythematous and warmduring the initial part of the hospitalization. Therefore thepatient went to arthroscopic examination on 7/16/2000. Thepatient's knee was lavaged with 9 liters of sterile saline prior toclosing all of the effusion was drained. There were nocomplications. The patient continued to have symptoms of right kneeeffusion and pain and therefore returned to the operating room on10/28/2000 for repeat arthrocentesis. Since that time the rightknee has reaccumulated a moderate sized effusion but the patienthas tolerated physical therapy and has regained a moderate amountof his range of motion. It was determined that the patient shouldnot have this effusion drained again because it was no longer warmor erythematous.The left shoulder was also quite tender during the initial hospitalstay. The patient underwent multiple joint aspirations of theglenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints , both at the bed side andunder fluoroscopic examination. Again , this joint demonstratedelevated white blood cell count but never any clear evidence thatit was a septic joint.The patient after his left eye enucleation , was noted to have anelevated CK of 1522. It was thought that this was an insignificantMB fraction. It was not felt that there was enough manipulation toskeletal muscles during the enucleation to warrant this. This risein CK did coincide with increased muscle aches. It was felt thatthe patient perhaps had a mild episode of rhabdomyolysis whichresolved quickly to a CK of 177 five days later.At the time of discharge the patient is experiencing no myalgias orarthralgias with the exception of the right knee which is stillsomewhat limited in its range of motion and demonstrates aneffusion but is responding well to rehabilitation.5. Pulmonary: The patient was quite stable from a pulmonarystandpoint throughout his hospitalization. The patient wasinitially maintained in the Emergency Room on high flow oxygenhowever was quickly weaned to nasal cannula and then room air. Thepatient does have obstructive sleep apnea and used his BIPAP atnight throughout his hospitalization.6. Hematology: On admission the patient demonstrated athrombocytopenia with a nadir of 51. This has improved throughouthis hospital course and on the day of discharge his platelets werenoted to be 538.The patient was noted to have hematocrit that trended down andcorresponded to some guaiac positive stools with anticoagulation.The patient received a total of four units of packed red bloodcells. His hematocrit has remained stable with a good reticulocytecount at the time of discharge.The patient was anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillationinitially with Heparin and then ultimately with Coumadin 10 mg p.o.q HS. The patient's INR has been therapeutic in the 2-3 range forapproximately five days.7. Renal: On admission the patient was noted to have an elevatedcreatinine from his baseline of 1.0. This was thought to besecondary to dehydration and prerenal azotemia. The patient'screatinine reached a peak of 3.0 and stabilized at 1.3 at the timeof discharge. This appears to have resolved entirely withresolution of sepsis and rehydration.8. Fluids/electrolytes/nutrition: The patient was significantdehydrated at the time of admission. This responded rapidly to invitro fertilization. He also regained his appetite as his sepsisresolved. The patient is noted however to have a very pooralbumen , which is 2.3 at the time of discharge. The patient willrequire improved nutrition at rehabilitation and after dischargefrom rehabilitation. The patient's electrolytes were relativelystable throughout his hospital stay.9. Endocrine: The patient has a long standing history of type IIdiabetes mellitus. On admission , he was taking metformin 1000 mgp.o. b.i.d. , regular insulin 10 q a.m. and 10 q p.m. , NPH insulin25 q a.m. and 20 q p.m. His hemoglobin A1-C was noted to beelevated at 8.1 in 11/15 The patient's metformin was heldthroughout his hospital stay with the anticipation of possibleinvasive procedures. He is maintained and NPH insulin as well assliding scale insulin. The patient was restarted on his metforminprior to discharge and increased dose of NPH insulin. This willlikely need to be adjusted as the patient recovers further.10. Gastrointestinal: The patient did develop guaiac positivestools during his anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. Thiswill need to be followed up as an outpatient once the patient hasmade a full recovery from the acute event. Also the patient diddemonstrate a mild transaminitis during his hospital stay and thisappears to have resolved with the transition from Penicillin toVancomycin for his antibiotic regimen.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ilotycin0.5% topical t.i.d. over left eyelid ,Lasix 160 mg p.o. b.i.d.

History of diverticulitis.2. History of questionable inflammatory bowel disease.3. GERD.4. Depression and chronic pain.5. History of breast cancer.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:1. Sigmoid colectomy in 2003.2. Right breast lumpectomy in 1998.3. Multiple Port-a-Cath placements.4. Right axillary lymph node dissection in 1998.5. History of endoscopy.HOSPITAL COURSE:This is a 41-year-old female with a history of diverticulitis andquestionable inflammatory bowel disease with a known colonicstricture since 4/5 The patient has had attempted to dilatationwithout success. The patient has also recent historyof ribbon like stools and complains of difficulty with bladderfunction as well as a sense of urgency to urinate. Her pastmedical history is significant for diverticulitis , questionableinflammatory bowel disease , GERD , depression , chronic pain , andhistory of breast cancer. Her surgical history is significantfor sigmoid colectomy in 2003 , right breast lumpectomy , axillarylymph node dissection in 1998 , as well as multiple Port-a-Cathplacements , and endoscopic treatment. She was admitted on7/20/04 and taken to the OR for a sigmoid colectomy; the procedurewas complicated by a left ureteral injury for which Urology wasconsulted intraoperatively. Urology placed a left ureteral stentintraoperatively and made recommendations to maintain stent for atotal of six weeks after which time it would be removed on anoutpatient basis ( Dr. Mahaffy will be following this case ). Inaddition , they recommended maintaining Foley for five days. TheEBL during the case was 2500 cc necessitating transfusion of 4units of packed red blood cells. She was extubated and taken tothe PACU in stable condition with an epidural in place onperioperative antibiotics of clindamycin and with NG tube inplace. Onpostoperative day #1 , it was noted that the patient wasincreasingly becoming confused and anxious as well as remainedtachycardic despite what was thought to be adequate volumeresuscitation and she was transferred to the unit at this point.More specifically , in addition to being tachycardic later thatday on postoperative day #1 , she became tachypneic with notedhypoxemia and mental status changes in need of intubation. Ofnote , the patient was saturating at 96% on 100% oxygen viafacemask. It is also notable that the patient in the 24-hourperioperative window received 14-liter of fluid resuscitation.The night of postoperative day #1 , as mentioned earlier , thepatient was increasingly agitated before she was transferred tothe unit and although discontinued her NG tube it was thought atthis time that she may have aspirated. She also removed hersupplemental oxygen and was noted to have saturations in the 85%range with tachycardia in the 140 range. A PE protocol CT wasobtained that was negative for emboli or DVT but was positive forright upper lobe posterior segment consolidation that wasconsistent with an aspiration event. She was subsequentlytransferred on the night of postoperative day #1 to the ICU ,intubated , and had a right IJ central line placed. Overnight ,between postoperative day #1 and postoperative day #2 , her bloodpressure would drop requiring multiple fluid boluses in additionto the administration of an additional unit of packed red bloodcells for a hematocrit of 23. She also received albumin. Ofnote , the CT also did not reveal any evidence of acute bleed;however , this was a noncontrast study. She was placed on Versedand propofol , intubated in the unit with a fentanyl patch ,remained tachycardic , the origin of which was unclear. It wasthought initially that there was some type of narcotic controlthat may be responsible for this tachycardia. However , it wasalso speculated that she may be bleeding from an unknown source.She was intubated , NPO , NG tube in place with IV fluidresuscitation , Foley in place per Urology as noted above , on subqheparin with close monitoring of the hematocrit with transfusionsto be given as necessary placed on a triple regimen ofclindamycin , levo , and Flagyl. On postoperative day #3 , thepatient in the unit with hypertension , anemia , tachycardia , thepatient's hematocrit was still 23 and she received 2 additionalunits of red blood cells and hematocrit rose to 30 at this time.She was poorly responsive on postoperative day #3 and it wasthought that she had better be weaned off of Versed whichhappened to be replaced with haloperidol. In addition , clonidinewas added to her regimen as well as Lopressor secondary to hertachycardia. There was close examination of her mental statusduring this time. On postoperative day #4 , the patient was stillpersistently tachycardic and hypertensive. JP was discontinuedon the day and , in addition , as noted above , Haldol and clonidinewere added to her regimen. She continued to be agitated andthere was a question raised then that there was an unclearhistory that was not previously diagnosed of alcoholism and thismay have been an alcohol withdrawal phenomenon. So , her Versedactually was increased then for a questionable alcohol withdrawaland she was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate and inaddition for her hypertension Lopressor 5 q.4 was continued. Shewas still intubated with goals of weaning off ventilation , NPO ,NG tube to low suction , the question of TPN was raised , levo andFlagyl for aspiration pneumonia which would be continued for10-14 days. By postoperative day #5 , it was clear that this wasa problem of drug or alcohol withdrawal at least that was whatwas thought. Her neuro regimen was changing at this time withvarious measures using Versed , then using Ativan , and Apresodexto changing her fentanyl regimen as well as adding morphine toher regimen p.r.n. all with goals of increasing the generalrelaxation. Psych was consulted on postoperative day #5 andconcluded that this woman had a history of polysubstance abuse ,alcohol and likely opiates , and chronic abdominal pain due tostricture which probably was related to her opioid abuse; Ibelieve the delirium was likely multifactorial in etiology ,postoperative delirium that was notable for significant fluidshifts , there was the question of aspiration pneumonia inaddition to possible opiate and alcohol withdrawal. Theyrecommended starting with Zyprexa if the patient was sedated inthe a.m. with a DC a.m. dose of Zyprexa and just use it in theevening and agreed to taper off the Versed minimizing the use ofopiates as tolerated by the patient and encouraged the family toreorient the patient to keep her awake during the day. Onpostoperative day #6 , her mental status was gradually clearing.Patient goal was to wean off sedation for a possible extubation.Her blood pressure as well as heart rate were stabilizing andtube feeds were also started at this point with multivitamins andmineral replacement. In addition , urine output continued to begood. Her hematocrit was stable. Her cultures were at thispoint negative , but the antibiotic Flagyl-levo regimen wascontinued. Of note , her stoma would gradually start to producefluid and her incision during this leg of her course remainedclean , dry , and intact. On postoperative day #6 , she was alsoconsulted by Addiction Psychiatry who concluded similar resultsto recommendations concluded earlier. They would agree with theZyprexa and also recommended restarting Ativan , as I said ,additionally agreeing with the taper off of the Versed with theuse of Ativan only for cases of agitation and additionallyrecommended to the discontinue the Celexa and BuSpar the patientwas on until the delirium cleared to avoid a polypharmacy. Ofnote , Psyche was able to speak with the husband who confirmed thepatient's longstanding history of alcohol dependence that likelypredated the 10 years that he had known her. It is important tonote that the patient was consuming approximately a quart ofVodka a day as well as Peppermint Schnapps daily up until hersurgery last April . After that procedure , she continued todrink presumably about 3 beers a day. However , the husband sincehe was working so much was unable to really adequately guage justhow much alcohol she was drinking. In addition , she was noted tohave , this is per the husband , undergone multiple detoxes attreatment facilities for alcohol dependence and believed that shehad experience withdrawal seizures in the past. On postoperativeday #7 , the patient's mental status was gradually improving withweaning off of her Versed with IV Ativan and low doses astolerated and p.r.n. She , in addition , this day was toleratingher tube feeds; however , she did pull her NG tube again. Her Foleywas taken out at this time. The ureteral injury believed to beresolved at this point , continued on her levo and Flagyl withquestion of whether or not to stop her antibiotic regimen. Onpostoperative day #8 , mental status continued to improve and shewas started on sips which she tolerated well. Her IV was heplocked and she was seen fit to be transferred to the floor. Ofnote , also on postoperative day #8 , the patient had some lowblood pressure which was treated with volume resuscitation in theform of normal saline boluses that stabilized right after hertransfer to the floor. On postoperative day #9 , it was notedthat the patient had some red stool in the ostomy bag. Thepatient was hemodynamically stable this was afternoon ofpostoperative day #9. Her labs were checked , CBC , and found tobe within normal limits and her ibuprofen which she was takingwas discontinued. On postoperative day #10 , with mental statusimproving greatly , the patient had her central line discontinued.Over the last couple of days , she had made attempts to walk andwas walking with PT. Her diet over the last couple of days hadbeen advanced without any problems and she was converted to ahouse diet on postoperative day #10. On postoperative day #11 ,her mental status seemingly completely resolved on regular diet ,out of bed. It was noted though that she had some erythema ofthe mid portion of her wound , three staples were removed fromthis portion of the wound and serosanguinous exudate wasexpressed , minimal amount of fluid. The wound was explored andthere was found to be no fascial defect. Cultures were taken atthis time and the wound was packed with wet-to-dry dressing withinstructions given to the patient and nursing for wet-to-drydressing changes t.i.d. On postoperative day #11 , the patientwas seen fit to be discharged home. Her mental status hadcompletely resolved. She was afebrile and hemodynamicallystable , tolerating a regular diet , and fully ambulatory. She wasto be discharged home with VNA Services. Medicine Team that hadbeen seeing her did agree that she needed to contact herpsychiatrist to provide an update of the current admission toupdate her on her medical regimen inhouse and she is to schedulean appointment to follow up with her psychiatrist. The MedicineTeam also recommended continuing her psyche medications she wastaking prior to admission that includes Celexa 4 mg q.d. , BuSpar10 mg t.i.d. , nortriptyline will be started by her psychiatrist.Also recommended to continue Ativan taper as followed with 1 mgt.i.d. today , 1 mg b.i.d. the next day which would have been5/29 , and then 1 mg q.a.m. on Wednesday 6/26, and then stoptaking the Ativan with instructions of no refills on the Ativan.The Medicine Team also strongly enforced , reminded her not todrink while taking the Ativan.ALLERGIES AND MEDICINE REACTIONS:IV Keflex gives her a rash.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:On 7/20/04 , the patient received a sigmoid colectomy , adiverting ostomy.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:See HPI.COMPLICATIONS:1.

The following day , after heat had been applied to thewound , one small area in the wound separated , and a seromacontaining some serosanguineous fluid was drained. The wound wasthen deeply probed , and extended very deeply. The fascia wascompletely intact. A Penrose drain was placed through the openingin the incision to allow the serosa to completely drain. Thefollowing day , on postoperative day number eight , the drain wasremoved , and the wound was packed deeply with Nu-Gauze soaked inhalf strength hydrogen peroxide. Wet-to-dry dressing changes wereperformed for several days , and the wound continued to remain cleanwith healthy appearing tissue. Wound culture revealed Staphylococcuscoagulase negative. She had been started on oral Ampicillin for enterococcalUTI.Thepatient became afebrile immediately after the wound drained and had no furtherelevations in her temperature. A chest film showed onlyatelectasis , and thus she was vigorously ambulated and receivedmore chest physical therapy , and Albuterol nebulized treatment. Ofnote , the patient's white count rose to 16 with a fever againprobably associated with the patient's wound infection. Thepatient is thus discharged home on 8/1/91 , postoperative day 12 instable condition. She will be followed very closely by theVisiting Nurses Association with frequent dressing changes andwound care. She will also be followed very closely by Dr. Jean Dorson as an outpatient. The patient is thus discharged home instable condition , following a complication of her surgery , a woundseparation.CA269/0533JONATHAN C.

Maslen , the internist atChicarl O Hospital for the question of transient ischemicattacks. On the evening of admission , the patient and his wifenoted fatigue , light-headedness and 3 episodes of diaphoresis. Thepatient took 1 to 2 ounces of ethanol for relaxation and severalhours later while attempting to climb stairs fell and was unable toget up. Soon after , he had one episode of melenotic soft stool inlarge volume without frank blood and then a moderate amount ofcoffee ground emesis. The emergency medical technicians werecalled , and in the ambulance the patient had a blood pressure of110/68 , heart rate 110. At the Ipal Healthemergency ward , his blood pressure had dropped to 95/60 and he wassymptomatically orthostatic. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy wasperformed in the emergency ward , which showed an actively bleeding1 cm antral lesion in the greater curvature , which was cauterized.This was thought to be consistent with a pancreatic cyst orleiomyoma , or less likely a metastatic lesion , along with some mildesophagitis. He had no previous history of peptic ulcer disease.The patient takes aspirin 1 to 2 tablets per day for several monthsas question treatment for transient ischemic attack and for his hippain. He also has daily ingestion of ethenol , approximately 2 to 3ounces , for many years. There was no history of nausea , vomiting ,diarrhea , weight loss , abdominal pain , anorexia or any otherconstitutional symptoms. There is a remote history of abdominalpain and spastic colon with a negative work-up in 1976 , including aBarium enema , upper gastrointestinal series and abdominalultrasound. He was admitted to the Suma Tondinoa Ylu County HospitalMedical Intensive Care Unit , where his course was notable for a5-unit packed red blood cell transfusion with stabilization of hishematocrit and vital signs. The initial hematocrit was 21 and hewas transfused up to the 37 range. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSIONincluded aspirin 2 po q day and Westcort Cream for psoriasis. PASTMEDICAL HISTORY was notable for chronic psoriasis , vertigo questiontransient ischemic attack , status post multiple excisions for basalcell skin carcinoma , history of hiatal hernia with a question ofreflux esophagitis , status post suprapubic prostatectomy for benignprostatic hypertrophy , status post herniorrhaphy , status postappendectomy , question of glucose intolerance diet controlled ,status post right cataract surgery with lens implantation. FAMILYHISTORY is notable for multiple siblings healthy in their late80's , one brother with pancreatic carcinoma , hypertension in motherand sister , no history of other systemic illnesses. SOCIAL HISTORYreveals the patient is a retired woman's clothing manufacturer , wholives in Field S with his wife , who is a Well Sirco Hospital employee. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS is negative , except for thevertigo and occasional episodes of diaphoresis.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a 79 year old man lookingremarkably well and fit. He was afebrile ,pulse 60 , blood pressure 130/72. His skin was well tanned withmultiple psoriatic patches on the lower extremities. Head , eyes ,ears , nose and throat examination was unremarkable. Neck wasnormal. Chest was clear. Cardiac examination showed S4 , S1 andS2 , no S3 , the murmur heard at admission was absent. Abdomen wassoft , flat , without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities showed pulsesto be intact without clubbing , cynosis or edema. Neurologicexamination was nonfocal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: The electrocardiogram was normal. Chestx-ray was normal. Urinalysis showed mildpyuria and hematuria , which will be followed. Laboratory values ofnote included a normal SMA-20 , except for a globulin of 1.6.Hematocrit was 37 , with a normal differential.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent several diagnostic studies ,including a repeat upper gastrointestinalendoscopy , which showed the 1-cm gastric antral lesion. It alsoshowed some thickened folds within the stomach , which werebiopsied. The lesion was not biopsied for fear of rebleeding. Thepatient also underwent an abdominal computerized tomography , whichshowed a 1 to 2 cm cystic appearing lesion felt to be consistentwith either dilated pancreatic duct or a small pancreaticpseudocyst. There was no evidence of intra-abdominal malignancy.The patient also underwent an upper gastrointestinal series , whichwas unremarkable. On 22 of July , the patient developed a tender leftbig toe , which was initially thought to be gout or anotherinflammatory arthritis , for example psoriatic arthritis , and he wasevaluated by the Rheumatology Service. The patient underwent ajoint tap , the findings of which were unremarkable. He also hadsome erythematous changes on the forefoot , and the picture wasthought to be consistent with a mild cellulitis , with perhaps theportal of entry being a psoriatic plaque. He was treated withintravenous Kefzol and the erythema resolved overnight. The othercomplicating issue is a mild elevation in liver enzymes noted onthe day before admission. This needs to be followed.DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE include Pepcid 20 mg po bid( this may be the cause of elevated liver functiontests ) , Velosef 500 mg po qid times 7 days , Westcort Cream.Disposition is to home. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is good. FOLLOW-UPcare is to be provided by Dr. Marcelino F.

ID - Candida non-albicansgrew out of his cultures fromhis hemodialysis center. He was started on amphotericin-B with anID consult , and will complete a four week course on 2/18/03. Hiscultures here at the Tholond Crawni Hospital remain negative. They removed hisinfected pacemaker , as well as his Hickman catheter. He has beenafebrile here for the last several weeks , 2-3 weeks prior todischarge.2. Cardiovascular - ( A ) Rhythm - His pacemaker was removed. Ithad been interrogated not long prior to his admission here and hadnot been firing , and therefore , did not appear to be needed anyway.He had to return to the EP lab a second time for a lead extraction ,as they were unable to pull out the leads on the first attempt. Byhis repeat echoes , however , he appears to have a retained pacemakerwire although EP believes that they removed the entire wire for allintents and purposes. It should be assumed that he does have aretained wire , however. Also , the patient had episodes of atrialflutter with rapid ventricular response and a decreased bloodpressure after his pacemaker was removed. He was ultimatelytreated with amiodarone with excellent control over his weight andrhythm , and has been in normal sinus rhythm for the last week or soprior to discharge. There are no plans for pacemaker placement atthis time. ( B ) Ischemia - He complained of chest pain while he washere and ruled out for a MI. ( C ) Pump - Hypertensive while inatrial flutter and then again during an episode of acute bloodloss. Since both issues have resolved , his blood pressures havebeen very stable. He is to be continued on his Vasotec andLopressor. ( D ) Vascular - He had a traumatic left groin lineattempt. Vascular , subsequently , performed a groin exploration ,hematoma evacuation , and sutured his vascular laceration. Thepatient continued to lose a significant amount of blood into histhigh , requiring several units of blood and one unit of platelets.His hematocrit , however , has now been stable for one week prior todischarge. He has a follow-up appointment with vascular on11/20/03.3. FEN/GU - Hemodialysis patent , very poor access. After removalof his possibly infected hemodialysis catheter , IR was completelyunable to place an IJ or subclavian catheter on either side.Ultimately , they had to place a tunnelled right groin line which isvery poor long-term option. He has a followup in vascular clinic with Dr Granfieldon 11/10/03 to address his access issue , for possible creatine of a groinAVfistula or graft.4. Heme - Hematocrit now stable , high 20s , low 30s. B12 andfolate are normal.5. Disposition - The patient is to be discharged to rehab on10/11/03 in stable condition. He has become very deconditionedwhile he was here in the hospital as he was unable to get much PThere given both his groin hematoma and some of his groin accessissues. Now there are no restrictions on his activity as his rightgroin line is tunnelled.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache ,amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. , amphotericin125 mg IV q.24h. to be given with 100 mg of hydrocortisone IV priorto his amphotericin , also should be treated with 1 mg IV ofmorphine prior to his amphotericin administration , Phoslo 2 tabsp.o. q.a.c. and q.h.s. , Cepacol 1-2 lozenges p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.throat pain , Cepacol 1 lozenge p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Vasotec 40 mg p.o. q.d. , hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q.d. ,Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Percocet 1 tab p.o. q.6h. , low dosebecause he is a hemodialysis patient , Zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,Risperdal 1 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Nephrocaps 1 tab p.o. q.d. , calciumcarbonate plus vitamin D 2 tabs p.o. b.i.d. away from meals , Nexium40 mg p.o. q.d. , ondansetron 4 mg IV p.r.n. emesis.FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: ( 1 ) Include 11/10/03 at 1:15 p.m. withDr. Oehmig , vascular surgery clinic at theSymore Tiesa Ri Memorial Hospital Of County .

She alsohas a history of coronary artery disease. She presented with oneday of substernal chest pain , shortness of breath , and nausea.The patient has normal angina pain , which is usually treated withnitroglycerin , but she had run out. The chest pain had resolvedwith nitroglycerin given in the ambulance. The patient alsocomplained of having abdominal pain for the past few days withsome nausea. Her last bowel movement was two days beforeadmission with no flatus for the past two days as well. Theabdominal pain was worst today. The patient was felt to have apartial small bowel obstruction in the emergency room and wasevaluated by both the surgical service and the medical service.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Incarcerated umbilical hernia and a mitralvalve replacement with a St. Jude valve in 1990. She hadcoronary artery disease with a clean catheterization in 2001 ,hypertension , diabetes , diverticulitis , status post a sigmoidcolectomy , and atrial fibrillation controlled with Coumadin 3.5mg q.d.MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg q.d. , Glyburide 5 mg q.d. , Lisinopril20 mg q.d. , Norvasc 10 mg q.d. , Coumadin 3.5 mg q.d. , Isordil 20mg three times a day , amiodarone 200 mg once a day.ALLERGIES: She has allergies to aspirin , penicillin , andsotalol.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone with no smoking and no alcoholuse.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Vital signs: Temperature was 96.8 ,heart rate was 76 , respiratory rate was 18 , blood pressure152/79 , O2 saturation was 94% on two liters. In general , she wasin no acute distress and pleasant. Cardiovascular exam: She hadan irregular rhythm with audible S1 and S2. No S3 was heard. Nomurmurs. No jugular venous distension. Chest was clear toauscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen had increased bowelsounds , was tympanitic , was diffusely tender. Her extremitieshad no edema.LABS: She had a white blood cell count of 14 , hematocrit of 42 ,platelets of 221 , 000 , sodium of 144 , potassium of 4 , chloride of109 , bicarb of 28 , BUN of 20 , creatinine of 1.6 , blood glucose of200 , troponin I was less than assay , CK was 118 , INR of 2.6. KUBx-ray showed dilated loops of small bowel consistent with smallbowel obstruction. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 78 beatsper minute with an incomplete right bundle branch block , an oldinferior MI with loss of anterior fossa.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's abdominal pain was most likelydue to small bowel obstruction secondary to a ventral hernia. Itwas decided by the surgical service that the ventral herniashould be fixed operatively. The medical service evaluated thepatient , decided that her chest pain was her normal baselineangina and she had no acute coronary syndrome at the time ofadmission. Recommendations were made to discontinue herCoumadin , allow her INR to fall to 1.8 before operating. Thepatient was also to be given generous boluses of normal salinepreoperatively to avoid hypotension and tight blood sugar controlduring her hospital course. The patient was admitted to themedical floor before her operation and was scheduled for ventralhernia repair several days later. During her stay on thesurgical ward , the patient had developed complaints of new visualchanges described as objects of floating in her visual field. Atthis point , a CT scan of the head was done to rule out an acutecerebral avascular accident. Head CT was initially read asnormal. No acute bleed. However re-read as showing a left-sidedsub acute thalamic infarct of 10 days to 2 weeks age. At thispoint , a neurological consultation was obtained. The neurologyconsultant recommended an MRI/MRA of the head and neck toevaluate for possible hidden acute stroke and a carotidultrasound to assess her carotid artery patency. The MRI/MRA ofher head was negative , a carotid ultrasound was done which wasalso negative with no lesions similar to her previous carotidartery ultrasound of 10/1 A transthoracic echocardiogram wasalso done to evaluate for atrial clots. Her echocardiogram waslargely unchanged from her previous echocardiogram of 2002. Shehad normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of55% and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Given this negativeworkup for any acute stroke , it was decided to obtain anophthalmology consult to evaluate the patient's visual changes.The ophthalmology consultant attributed her visual changes tovitreous humor particulate matter , which is very common in olderpeople. It was most likely the cause of her visual changes. Theophthalmology consultant recommended q.d. Pred Forte drops ineach eye for her status post corneal transplant.The patient was finally taken to the operating room on hospitalday 7 for ventral hernia repair. The operation was uncomplicatedwith minimal blood loss. Postoperatively , the patient's courseprogressed well with good pain control , good progression of dietand good ambulation. Postoperatively , the patient was restartedon Coumadin and placed on IV heparin for prophylaxis secondary toher mitral valve prosthetic. The patient remained in thehospital for seven days after her operation for adequateanticoagulation with Coumadin. On postop day 3 , the patient wasnoticed to have bright red blood in her urine. A urologicalconsult was obtained for evaluation of gross hematuria. CAT scanshowed several centimeters of calcified bladder wall , which isindicative of infection versus tumor. However no gross tumormass was observed and the remainder of her collecting system wasnormal. The urological consult recommended follow up in UrologyClinic in two to four weeks. The patient was then discharged onpostop day 7 to the Awind Pitwell Medical Center for continued physical therapy.DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. , vitamin B1215 mcg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Folate 1 mg p.o.q.d. , glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Pred Forte Ophthalmic one drop eacheye q.d. for seven days , vitamin B6 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin 7.5mg q.p.m. , Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d.DISPOSITION: The patient will follow up with Dr. Weltch inSurgery Clinic in one week and the patient will follow up inUrology Clinic in two to four weeks.eScription document: 9-3908985 EMSSten TelDictated By: MCKENZIE , STEPHANAttending: VUKICH , FRANKDictation ID 5038792D: 11/11/03T: 11/11/03

He hadrecurrent ischemic symptoms four months later and cardiaccatheterization showed restenosis of his LAD with an 80% lesionat D3. He had brachytherapy and repeat PTCA. Since then , he hasdone well but he had increasing dyspnea from CR. Exercisethallium test , which showed increasing LV filling pressuresduring exercise and inferior apical ischemia. He was admittedfor cardiac catheterization , which was done on 2/13/06 and thepatient was found to have a 45% proximal right coronary arterydisease , 50% distal left main disease , and 95% mid LAD disease.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Significant for hypertension , dyslipidemia , and chest radiation ,prostate cancer , osteoporosis , and urinary incontinence.HOSPITAL COURSE:He was admitted , made ready for surgery. He was taken to theoperating room on 1/5/06. At which time , he underwent a CABGx3 with a LIMA to the LAD , a saphenous vein graft to the PDA anda saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal. The patient'saortic valve was only found to be mildly stenotic with the valvearea of 1.4 and a peak gradient of 30. This was discussed withhis cardiologist , Dr. Cletus Columbres and a combined decision was madenot to replace the aortic valve at this time. The patient'simmediate postoperative course was uncomplicated. He wastransferred to the Intensive Care Unit in a stable fashion. Hewas found to have an inferior lateral ischemia on EKG , therefore ,he was taken to the cath lab , all grafts were found to be patentand there was resolution of ischemia. He was weaned off his pressors and hewas extubated.He was found to be hemodynamicallystable. He was started on Lopressor and gentle diuresis. Onpostoperative day #3 , we titrated up his Lopressor and started onhis Norvasc and transferred him to the Step-Down Unit. Onpostoperative day #4 , he was slightly tachycardic with ambulationand we titrated up on his beta-blockers. PA and chest x-ray lookgood. Physical therapy was consulted to decide whether thepatient would benefit from rehabilitation. He was started onempiric levofloxacin for questionable pneumonia. He was foundsuitable for discharge on postoperative day #5 , however , thepatient had isolated temperature and his white count was found tobe trending and he was hypertensive. The patient was found tohave a positive blood culture from when he had been in theIntensive Care Unit and he was continued on levofloxacin. Thepatient was discovered to have left leg cellulitis at the kneewhere his saphenous vein graft was harvested from. He wasstarted on vancomycin. This area continued to be watched whilethe patient remained on IV antibiotics. He was afebrile. Hiswhite blood cell count was 12. The patient remained stable buthe continued to have a white count and leftleg ultrasound finally done on postoperative day #10 , revealed afluid collection above the knee to the mid calf mostly behind hisknee where the area of erythema was and his white blood cellcount went up to 15. Therefore , on 9/6/06 , the patient wastaken to the operating room , at which time , he underwent adrainage and irrigation of his left lower extremity saphenousvein donor site , moderate amount of fluid were expressed , andcultures were taken. The patient was transferred back to theStep-Down Unit after this procedure.

Thepatient ran out morphine three days prior to his admission andpresents with a two day history of chest heaviness and shortness ofbreath. The patient originally presented in September of 1997 with aright foot cellulitis and claudication at 50 yards. This wastreated with debridement and broad spectrum antibiotics andsubsequently treated with amputation of his right toe. On October ,1997 , the patient underwent a right femoral popliteal bypass. Hewas subsequently readmitted in January of 1997 for a left femoralpopliteal bypass and a split thickness skin graft to his fifth toe.He was admitted again in the end of January through the beginning ofApril with a question of a left thigh wound graft infection forwhich he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. He wasdischarged to home and is now readmitted with chest pain andheaviness.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for the above with the additionof hypertension , peripheral vasculardisease , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and depression.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Wellbutrin 75 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )Vasotec 5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Glyburide5 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. 5 )Nafcillin 2 mg intravenously q.4h. 6 ) Morphine.ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 98.9 degrees ,heart rate 92 , blood pressure 122/60.Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light. His neckdemonstrated a right carotid bruit. There was no lymphadenopathy.There was no jugular venous distension. Auscultation of the chestrevealed bibasilar rales. Cardiac examination revealed a regularrate and rhythm without murmurs , gallops or rubs. There was anormal S1 and S2. Abdominal examination revealed positive bowelsounds , soft , non-tender , non-distended abdomen. Extremitiesdemonstrated bilateral groin scars and the left medial thigh woundwhich was open for a length of approximately 5 cm with woundpacking. The base of the wound looked well granulated. There wasbilateral ankle edema. Pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally.LABORATORY: Admission laboratory data revealed that theelectrolytes were normal. His white blood cell countwas 13.9. Liver function tests were within normal limits. CK was70 and the Troponin I was 0.0.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medicine Servicewhere he ruled out for myocardial infarctionwith CKs of 39 and 70. His EKGs however demonstrated marked T-waveinversion in the precordial leads. The chest pressure andtightness resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and Lopressor.His initial presentation was complicated by the fact that it wasthought he was undergoing withdrawal from narcotics which he wasusing perioperatively. However , he ultimately underwent a cardiaccatheterization on June , 1997 which demonstrated a 40% mid LADlesion and 50% distal LAD lesion , 50% proximal second diagonallesion and 99% OM1 lesion with slow flow , along with an 80% OM2lesion and a 99% RCA lesion. Ejection fraction at that time wasnoted to be 40%. Given the patient's presentation , he was bookedfor coronary artery bypass grafting which he underwent on February ,1997. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferredto the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively and had an uneventfulpostoperative recovery. He was maintained on Diltiazem for hisradial artery graft. His course was only complicated byintermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter.

THe patient's admission regimine of Lantus 40 qd was causing both hyper and hypoglycemia in house. Her hospital coursewas notable for a few episodes of hypoglycemia resulting in downtitration of insulin AM and PM doses. THe patient was noted to beextremely hypoglycmeic on 8 units of 70/30 in the PM and the PMinsulin was discontinued for the time being. It was decided that thepatient's diet at home would have higher glucose and carbohydratecontent and her Fs's will need further w/up as outpatient. We reccomendtitrating the 70/30 insulin up as needed.3.GI: she complained of mild epigastric pain after meals , and said itis thought that this represents diabetic gastroparesis.

She was last here in April of 2002. The patient wasadmitted on March , 2002 for a planned left fourth toeamputation and VAC sponge change by Dr. EttelPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history includeshypertension , coronary artery disease ,status post myocardial infarction , insulin dependent diabetesmellitus , history of seizures , status post cerebrovascularaccident , gastroesophageal reflux disease , and asthma.ALLERGIES: The patient's allergies include penicillin , aspirin ,NSAIDs , and pentazocine.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patientwas on Zestril 20 mg q.d. , Plavix 75 mgq.d. , Peri-Colace 30 mg b.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg b.i.d. , Gabitril 12TIT t.i.d. , Flagyl 500 t.i.d. , Lantus insulin 80 units q.h.s. ,ceftazidime 1 gm q. 8 , vancomycin 1 gm b.i.d. , esomeprazole 20 mgq.d. , Prozac 20 mg q.d. , folic acid 1 mg q.d. , Humalog slidingscale , Lasix 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Dilaudid p.r.n. , Dulcolax p.r.n. ,ofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmologic drops one OU q.i.d. , Cosopt one dropOU b.i.d. , brimonidine tartrate 0.2% ophthalmologic drops one OUq.i.d. , Pred Forte 0.12 b.i.d. drops both eyes.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination revealed temperature tobe 98.7 , heart rate 72 , and blood pressure154/71. HEENT was negative. The chest was clear. The abdomen wasprotuberant , soft , and non-tender. The extremities revealed openamputations of the bilateral feet with 2+ femoral pulses andpalpable DP and PT pulses bilaterally with right greater than left.There was no evidence of cellulitis with a necrotic left fourthtoe.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Vascular: The patient was admitted for the left fourth toeamputation , which occurred on April . This woundwas left open. She tolerated the procedure well with a VAC changeoccurring on August at the bedside. At that time , it was notedthat , although , there was pink granulation tissue , the fifth toehad become ischemic and nonviable. Therefore , the patient wastaken to the operating room on August for a left fifth toeamputation , which was also left open. That was tolerated well , butdid not seem to be viable secondary to ischemia and infection.Therefore , on March , 2002 , she was taken to the operating roomfor a left transmetatarsal amputation of the third , fourth andfifth toes. Dressing changes , wet-to-dry , were done. During thattime , it was noted that additional necrotic debris at the lateralaspect of the foot required more debridement , so she was taken tosurgery on April for debridement and a partial resection ofthe left fifth metatarsal. A VAC was placed and changed onMarch at the bedside. On October , 2002 , the wound wasfelt to be clean enough and a split thickness skin graft was placedon the left foot , 75 square cm , and the donor site was the leftthigh. This seemed to be taking well. We continued with dressingchanges and a heat lamp to the donor site , which healed well. OnFebruary , 2002 , we took her to the operating room again fordebridement of the left foot. The plantar aspect of the skin grafthad become discolored and we felt the infection requireddebridement. Intraoperatively , the bone did not seem to beinvolved and , at this point , we had been continuing wet-to-drydressing changes and , as of January , 2002 , the plan was to takethe patient to the operating room on January , 2002 for anotherskin graft. Now that the wound is clean , she has completedantibiotics.2. Neurological: The patient has a history of a seizure disorder ,which has been stable on Gabitril. She isstatus post stroke and is stable. For her depression , she receivesProzac. Her pain is well controlled on a Fentanyl patch withoxycodone for p.r.n. pain and Dilaudid for breakthrough pain. Thepatient also has occasional dizziness and this is treated withp.r.n. meclizine.3. Cardiovascular: The patient has coronary artery disease and isstatus post a myocardial infarction , andhypertension , which is currently well controlled on Lopressor 50 mgt.i.d.4. Respiratory: The patient has asthma that has been stable andnot evidenced in the hospital.5. GI: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal refluxdisease , which is treated with esomeprazole. She is on adiabetic diet. She receives Colace , Senna , multivitamins , folicacid and Niferex.6. GU: The patient is receiving Lasix 100 mg b.i.d. at thismoment. Her admission creatinine was 0.7 , peaked at 2.0on February , at which time we called a renal consultation , whosaid she was probably pre-renal acute renal failure secondary toace inhibitor , Lasix and a new bunch of antibiotics. At that timewe held the ace inhibitor , held the Lasix , and renally dosed theantibiotics , at which time her creatinine came down to 1.1 , whichis closer to her baseline. We have slowly restarted Lasix and shehas tolerated that. We have since discontinued her antibiotics.7. Heme: The patient's admission hematocrit was 25.7 , for whichshe received 1 unit of packed red blood cells onApril . She received another unit of packed red blood cells onNovember and her most recent hematocrit , on January , was 26.8.Therefore , she is baseline anemic.8. Infectious Disease: This has been another major issue for thispatient. Starting from the beginning , onOctober , the patient had a urinary tract infection with mixedflora , for which she was treated with a five day course of Diflucanfor Candida. On April , a wound culture of the left footshowed Pseudomonas , which was resistant to multiple drugs ,multidrug resistant E. coli , and methicillin resistantStaphylococcus aureus , as well as multidrug resistant Klebsiella.On February , when we went to the operating room for furtherdebridement of the left foot , we obtained deep cultures from theoperating room and found Pseudomonas diphtheroid and Klebsiella ,which were sensitive to vancomycin and cefotaxime. InfectiousDisease had consulted on our patient and recommended vancomycin ,cefepime and Flagyl and a two week course of these antibiotics fora soft tissue infection. It did not appear in the operating roomagain that the bone was involved in the infection. An MRI onAugust , however , showed soft tissue swelling in the sinustract that was suspicious for osteomyelitis of the fifthmetatarsal , but , in consultation with Infectious Disease , VascularSurgery , her operative findings , and clinical picture , we decidedit looked more like a soft tissue infection and treated her for twoweeks with antibiotics.9. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus and her bloodsugar control has been an issue throughout herhospital stay , slowly titrating up to her current Lantus dose of150 units subq q.h.s. She seems to be doing well with that.10. Ophthalmology: The patient is status post bilateral cataractsurgery and attempted filter for glaucoma inthe right eye and high pressure with pain , and proliferativeretinopathy with bilateral traction detachment. She was taking thefollowing medications: Pred Forte , Cosopt , ofloxacin , and Alphaganfor her eyes. On August , she had an Ophthalmology appointmentfor floaters and that diagnosis was proliferative diabeticretinopathy , status post pan retinal phototherapy with vitreoushemorrhage. On October , she had an appointment with Dr. Saulsbury at277-598-1768 , who recommended to add timolol to her eye drops , andwill be following up with her.11. Dental: The patient had an appointment on July , wherethey recommended a root canal of #18 and #19 forcaries. This root canal was done on January . The number of theclinic is 210-793-1150.12. Skin: The patient received Lotrimin , miconazole and woundcare to her right foot with Regranex. The left foot isreceiving wet-to-dries q.d.13. Tubes , lines and drains: The patient had a right PICC lineplaced on October , 2002.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:Neurological: Continue.Cardiac: Continue.Respiratory: Continue.GI: Continue.GU: Continue with monitoring of creatinine.Heme: Continue with monitoring of hospital course.Infectious Disease: No antibiotics needed , but follow left woundclosely and she is positive for methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus , so she will need to be inisolation.Endocrine: Blood sugar control.Ophthalmology: She need follow-up with her ophthalmologist abouther retinopathy , bilateral detachment and glaucoma.Dental: She had a root canal done and will need follow-up.Vascular: Will need to follow her bilateral extremity examinationand the skin graft to her left foot to ensure properhealing.

The patient hadpresented to the Special OB Clinic as a new patient for prenatalcare. Review of her medical problems revealed that the recentglucose control had been suboptimal. In view of this and in viewof the fact that the patient had multiple other issues , thepatient was admitted for diabetic control , adjustment of herinsulin regimen and evaluation regarding the other medicalproblems.History of present pregnancy: the patient had a lastmenstrual period in the second week of October . Ultrasound on theday of admission , 9/5/07 , revealed a 6.6-week intrauterinepregnancy with a fetal heart rate of 110. The estimated date ofconfinement is 4/19/07. Prenatal screening labs were pending atthe time of admission. The patient has blood group O +ve.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of ST elevationmyocardial infarction in 2000. The infarct was a presumedembolism to the left anterior descending and the left circumflex coronaryartery. The complete occlusion of the mid-to-distal leftanterior descending artery , which was thought to be due tothrombosis , was treated with TPA and angioplasty. The patient hada normal catheterization in October 2000. The last echocardiogramrevealed an ejection fraction of 45% in 2002; however , thepatient never had a repeat echo since that time. On the day ofadmission , the patient reported that she was able to climb fourflights of stairs to her apartment , haveing to pause after two flights ofstairs to catch her breath.In addition , the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , diagnosed in 2000.The patient had a medical admission in 2006 for hypoglycemia when sheincidentally injected Humalog instead of Lantus. On the day of admission , thepatient was on a Humalog 7 units b.i.d. and Lantus 12 units inthe evening. Her fasting sugars were in the 150s before admission and herblood sugar measurements were over 200 in the evening. On the day ofadmission , the fasting sugar was 123.In addition , the patient has a history of hepatitis B ,diagnosed in 2005. The patient had a positive E antigen in 2005.She had previously been on Epivir 150 mg p.o. daily , but thiswas stopped prior to the current pregnancy.PAST OB/GYN HISTORY: The patient has a history of a fibroiduterus , and a history of recurrent miscarriages. In terms of thefibroid uterus , the patient did report pelvic pain in theoutpatient setting. Ultrasound had shown an 8-10 cmdominant posterior fibroid. The patient occasionally takesoxycodone for fibroid pain.In terms of the patient's recurrent miscarriages , the patient had fifteen SABsin the past with over 10 dilatation and evacuations , including one molarpregnancy with subsequent choriocarcinoma. All losses were in the firsttrimester , less than 12 weeks' gestation. The patient had beenevaluated previously for a thrombophilia workup , but this hadbeen negative multiple times aside from a MTHFR gene mutation ,which was noted on this admission , and it is unclear whether thishas been addressed previously. The patient had previously beentold by a reproductive endocrinologist , that she should consideradoption or a gestational carrier. Chromosomes on severalpathology specimens from the previous abortions showedaneuploidy.The patient currently denies a history of sexuallytransmitted infections. She has a history of cervical dysplasia ,with a history of CIN I and CIN II in 1990 and 1992. Sheunderwent a LEEP in 1992 , which was consistent with HSIL. Allsubsequent Pap smears were either within normal limits. Last Papsmear done in February 2006 at Rexmo Sha Hospital Of was insufficient foranalysis. In terms of the patient's history of choriocarcinoma , the patienthad a molar pregnancy , which then developed into a subsequent choriocarcinoma.For this , the patient was treated with methotrexate , actinomycin D and Cytoxan ,then VP-16 , cisplatin and bleomycin with presumed cure.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Dilatation and evacuation x10 ,hysteroscopy for infertility workup , and LEEP.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Humalog Insulin 7 units twice a day ,Lantus 12 units in the evening , aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily stoppedprior to pregnancy , history of lamivudine/Epivir use , 150 dailystopped prior to current pregnancy.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: Former smoker , given up smoking in 2000 after amyocardial infarct. No history of alcohol abuse or IV drug use.The patient lives in Doreska Dr , Nah Min Knox with her boyfriend , unemployed.FAMILY HISTORY: No history of GYN malignancies , history ofmaternal diabetes , longstanding. Father with coronary arterydisease in his 50s.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the primarypurpose of diabetic control.1. Diabetes mellitus. The patient had reported poor diabeticcontrol as an outpatient. Therefore , her regimen was continued ,with the addition of a sliding scale , in order to determine theadditional insulin needs as an outpatient. Over the course ofthe admission , the patient's Lantus was increased to 20 units atnighttime , and she was using 8 units three times a day of insulinlispro , in addition to a lispro sliding scale. With thisregimen , the fingerstick glucose control improved , and thefasting blood sugar on the day of discharge was 90. On the dayprior to discharge , the patient had blood sugars in the rangefrom 93 to 139. An HbA1c was sent , which was 6.7 , during thisadmission , the patient also had a Nutrition consult. She will befollowed in the High-Risk Obstetric and Diabetic Clinic by Dr.Borguez2. Cardiology. The patient was restarted on her aspirin , givenher history of myocardial infarct at a very early age. Inaddition , an echocardiogram was obtained on the day afteradmission. This revealed an ejection fraction of 50% as well asa large left ventricular thrombosis , which was presumed to be alongstanding. Cardiology was consulted and the impression wasthat the thrombosis was likely a combination of her leftventricular hypokinesia related to the previous infarct , as wellas her hypercoagulable state. Therefore , their recommendationwas to start the patient on Lovenox for the duration of thispregnancy , which adjusted for her weight was a dose of 90 mgdaily , followed by a transition to Coumadin postpartum , to becontinued for likely long-term , possibly lifelong duration. TheCardiology Consult Team noted that the MTHFR mutation had notresulted in elevated homocysteine levels in the past. However ,they did agree that folate supplementation at high doses wasindicated. The patient will be continued on Lovenox 90 mg dailysubcutaneously , and aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily as an outpatient.She will have Cardiology followup with Dr. Jasper Erps on3/6/07. During the entire admission , she was hemodynamicallystable , in sinus rhythm , with no complaints of chest pain ,shortness of breath or palpitations.3. Hepatitis B. The patient had liver function tests and ahepatitis panel on this admission , given her history of activedisease diagnosed in 2005 , with a positive hepatitis E antigen.On admission , the patient had not been on Epivir , which had beenstopped prior to this current pregnancy. Liver function testswere checked on this admission and were within normal limits. Inaddition , serologies were checked and the hepatitis E antigen andthe E antibody was negative. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis Bcore antigen were reactive. At the time of this dictation , ahepatitis B viral load was pending. Given the patient's historyof hepatitis B , an outpatient appointment was being arranged atthe time of discharge , with Dr. Lavy , from the Division ofGastroenterology at the Sasspan Hospital . It wasdecided that the patient should not take any lamivudine untilGastroenterology followup. During the entire hospital stay , thepatient did not have any GI complaints , was tolerating a regulardiet , and having normal regular bowel movements.4. history of fibroids , the patient was noted again to have an 8-cm fibroidon her ultrasound scan. She required rare intermittent doses ofoxycodone as required for pain , which was presumed to be relatedto her fibroid uterus.5. Prenatal care. The patient had her first trimester labs senton this admission. GC and chlamydia testing were negative.Urine culture was negative. The patient was O +ve. Given thepatient's history of MTHFR mutation and the recurrent SABs , thepatient was started on prenatal vitamins , as well as high-dosefolic acid , B12 and B6. In view of the patient's diabetichistory , and a transiently elevated creatinine to 1.2 on hospitalday 2 , which went back to 0.7 on the day of discharge , thepatient had a 24-hour urine collection sent , this returnednegative at 92 mg per 24 hours. It was noted that the patienthad an Ophthalmology retinal exam at an outside hospital healthcenter this year. For the remainder of this pregnancy , it wasnoted that the patient will require ultrasounds at 11 and 17weeks , as well as a fetal echo , and the recommended testing forpre-gestational diabetics for the remainder of the pregnancy.The patient was discharged in a stable condition , with followupappointments arranged for the various specialties.DISPOSITION: Home without services.DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.

Chestx-ray showed no infiltrate and no effusion. EKG showed atrialflutter at 156 , borderline left ventricular hypertrophy initiallythen after 5 mg of intravenous Verapamil , he converted to atrialfibrillation at 100 , and there were no specific ST-T wave changes.He also underwent VQ scan which showed high intermediateprobability scan.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology Bservice for management of atrialfibrillation/atrial flutter and question of pulmonary embolus. Hewas heparinized and was continued on Lopressor for rate control.He was placed on cardiac monitor. In addition because of the lowgrade fevers , more blood cultures were obtained. He underwent a PAgram on January , 1996 which showed no evidence of pulmonaryembolism , normal right heart pressures , and bibasilar subsegmentalatelectasis. Patient was begun on Coumadin and he was also seen byinfectious disease consultation who felt that he should be off allantibiotics. He also underwent a transesophageal echo on January ,1996 which showed mildly dilated left ventricle with low normalsystolic function , aortic homograft with no vegetation or fluidcollection around the annulus , trace aortic insufficiency waspresent , mitral valve was mildly thickened with 1+ mitralregurgitation but no obvious vegetations , tricuspid and pulmonicvalves were normal with no vegetations , and left atrium was alsonormal with no thrombus. Patient continued to have low gradefevers with no obvious evidence of infection and infectious diseaseconsultation service suggested that patient be discharged to homeoff all antibiotics and be followed closely at home withinstructions to return to the hospital with any signs of increasingfevers , chills , or any problems with the incision site.DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged to home on May , 1996 ingood condition.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,diltiazem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and Coumadin10 mg p.o. q.d.FOLLOW-UP: Patient has follow-up with Dr. BeamerDictated By: OLIN LINLEY , M.D. AD9Attending: SHAD F.

Bilateral adnexalmasses. Diabetes mellitus.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cristopher Ottilige is a 53 year old womanwith a history of diabetes mellituswho presents with abdominal pain and fevers over two weeksduration. Two weeks prior to admission , the patient had headaches ,nausea , vomiting , presyncope , anorexia with mild periumbilicalpain. She also had fevers to 101 degrees F. with associated chillsand diaphoresis. The patient presented to her primary carephysician three days before admission and was found to haveelevated liver function tests with AST of 39 , ALT of 108. At thattime , the patient was presumed to have a viral syndrome. Two daysprior to admission , the patient developed worsening abdominal pain.The pain was described as sharp , constant in character withradiation to the back. The pain was more intense in the rightlower quadrant. The pain was also noted to be in the lower flanksand the costovertebral angle area. The patient has noted no changein her usual bowel habits of one stool per week. She has had nodiarrhea , constipation , melena , or hematochezia. She has had nohematemesis. She denies any urinary symptoms but only hasnocturia. Of note , the patient had menopause approximately eightyears ago , but in each of the last three months she has noticedmonthly vaginal bleeding which she believes are a resumption ofmenstrual cycles. The last episode was about one month ago. Thepatient also has a history of nephrolithiasis but feels that thiscurrent pain is different from the one she has had in the past.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , diabetesmellitus diagnosed two years ago , obesity ,obstructive sleep apnea , nephrolithiasis , osteoarthritis , glaucoma.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for cesarean section 20 years agothat was complicated by pulmonary embolism.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Lasix 60 mg q day. 2. Glyburide 5 mgq day. 3. Labetalol 200 mg b.i.d.4. Timoptic , Xylatan drops for glaucoma.ALLERGIES: Lidocaine leads to rash. Lisinopril leads to cough.Diltiazem leads to edema. Nifedipine leads to edema.Intravenous contrast leads to hives.FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for cardiovascular disease.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and has two children. Shedenies any use of alcohol or tobacco.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 102 , heart rate 90 , respiratoryrate 34 , blood pressure 143/48. Oxygensaturation 91% on 2 liters nasal cannula. HEENT: Pupils equal ,round , reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular musclesintact. Anicteric sclerae. Oropharynx clear. No jugular venousdistension. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART:Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs. ABDOMEN:Obese and fairly firm. Diffusely tender to palpation. Increasedright lower quadrant pain. Rebound tenderness and mild guarding.Bowel sounds are present but decreased. BACK: No costovertebralangle tenderness. CERVIX: Cervical motion tenderness is present.NEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and oriented x3.LABORATORY: Chemistries revealed sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 ,chloride 94 , CO2 32 , BUN 13 , creatinine 1. Glucose315 , calcium 9.9. Liver function tests showed ALT 58 , AST 23 , ALK127 , total bilirubin 1.2 , albumin 4.6 , globulin 3.1 , amylase 28 ,lipase 145 , total protein 7.7. The complete blood cell countrevealed a white blood cell count of 23.91 , hemoglobin 14.1 ,hematocrit 41.8 , platelets 520. The differential showed 77 polys ,7 bands , 6 lymphocytes , and 6 monocytes. The urinalysis wasnotable for pH 5.5 , protein 1+ , glucose 1+ , leukocytes 1+ , nitritepositive , trace ketones , and no blood. Sediments showed whiteblood cells 45 - 50 , 4+ bacteria , 1+ squamous epithelial cells , 1 -2 casts. Abdominal CT was notable for a 7 x 8 cm low density fluidcollection in the region of the right adnexa and a 4 x 8 cm lowdensity fluid collection in the left adnexa. A UCG was negative.PROCEDURES: September , 2000 , endometrial biopsy. The procedurewas limited due to the patient's body habitus. Thebiopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy. Complications none.HOSPITAL COURSE: By systems:1. GENITOURINARY. The patient's presentingsymptoms and abdominal CT findings of bilateral adnexal masses weresuspicious for a tubo-ovarian abscess. However , the patient didnot have any of the associated risk factors , given that the patientis not sexually active and denied introducing any foreign objectsinto the vagina. The patient was initially managed on tripleantibiotics , ampicillin , gentamicin , and Clindamycin. Since a CTscan is not the optimal test to evaluate the adnexa , a transvaginalultrasound was ordered which revealed endometrial thickness of 3.6mm and bilateral cystic masses. The patient's right upper quadrantpain and tenderness persisted for several days during the admissionwith periodic exacerbations and was increasingly suspicious forcholelithiasis or pancreatitis. The patient then had an abdominalultrasound which was essentially was within normal limits andshowed no abnormal viscera. The bilateral adnexal masses continuedto be of major concern , and interventional radiology was consultedfor possible aspiration. Given that the etiology of the masses wasunclear and the risk of malignancy in a post menopausal woman , itwas decided that the best approach would be open tissue sampling.It was then decided to postpone this procedure pending furtherevaluation of the patient. Of note , the patient had a CA-125 drawnwhich 77. Serum HCG was negative. The patient's report of newonset of post menopausal bleeding was concerning. Considering thehigh likelihood of malignancy , the patient was being followed bythe gynecology oncology service and underwent endometrial biopsyfor tissue sampling. The biopsy revealed no evidence ofmalignancy. The patient had a repeat CT scan on hospital daynumber seven which was essentially unchanged from admission showingpersistent bilateral adnexal masses and no free fluid. Thepatient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain persisted butbecame more responsive to treatment toward the end of theadmission. Throughout the admission the actual etiology of thebilateral adnexal masses was never discerned. As a result , thepatient was referred to the gynecology oncology service forcontinued follow up as an outpatient.2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The patient's presentation of fevers ,chills , and diaphoresis was certainly suspicious for infectiousprocess. Initially the patient was covered with ampicillin ,gentamicin , and Clindamycin for empiric antimicrobial coverage.The urine culture was notable for greater than 100 , 000 Escherichiacoli which was pan sensitive. All blood cultures at initialpresentation had been negative. On October , the creatininelevel increased to 1.8. As a result , gentamicin was then switchedto Levofloxacin. The patient's fever initially defervesced from102.2 to 99.3 , but spiked to 100.1 after six days of antibiotics.Her white blood cell count remained elevated and ranged from 24 to32. However , by discharge the white blood cell count was 10.Because of the patient's initial minimal response to antibiotics ,repeat blood cultures and urine cultures were sent which werenegative. In addition , ID was consulted to provide furtherguidance regarding antimicrobial management. They recommended tocontinue ampicillin and Levofloxacin. Clindamycin was changed toFlagyl. By discharge , the patient was afebrile.3. CARDIOVASCULAR. By hospital day number two , the patient wasnoted to have increased lower extremity swelling and new bibasilarcrackles. The symptoms were suggestive of volume overload andpossibly congestive heart failure. A chest x-ray was notable forbilateral atelectasis in the lower lobes but no pulmonary edema orpleural effusions. A cardiac echocardiogram revealed normalsystolic function with ejection fraction of approximately 60% andmild left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient was treated withLasix and was aggressively diuresed. She responded well totreatment.4. NEUROLOGIC. The patient presented with abdominal pain and wasinitially with Demerol and Vistaril. Initially the patient wasonly minimally responsive to treatment , but over time she becamemore responsive. By discharge , the patient was without pain.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. Glyburide 5 mgp.o. q day. Labetalol 200 mg p.o.b.i.d. Flagyl 500 mg p.o. q 8 hours.

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.2. HERPES ZOSTER.BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 80-year-old man with a historyof coronary artery disease , who was transferred toZa Valley Hospital two days following an acute myocardialinfarction , for post myocardial infarction management. The patienthas known coronary artery disease , and is status post myocardialinfarction in 1998. At this time he underwent a two-vessel CABGwith a saphenous vein graft to the RCA and to the LAD. Since then ,he claims that he has done very well with rare angina( approximately two times a year ) which responds well to sublingualnitroglycerin.He underwent an exercise treadmill test in 1997 , that showedinferolateral ST depressions with exercise , that were considerednon-diagnostic , secondary to LVH and some resting EKGabnormalities.On August , the patient noted 10 out of 10 chest pain while walkingwith his family. He took sublingual nitroglycerin times three withno relief. He was taken to Tioncollgos Memorial Hospital where an EKGshowed ST depressions in leads V2 through V4 , and T wave flatteningin V1 and V5. He also had T wave inversions in V2 through V4. Thepatient was treated with intravenous heparin , intravenousnitroglycerin , and beta blockers. He remained pain free after thistreatment. He eventually developed a Q wave in V1. During hishospitalization at Frontnor Valley Medical Center , the patient was noted to havean 11 beat run of V-tach on August , and was started on a lidocainedrip. The lidocaine drip was stopped on September , and theintravenous nitroglycerin was weaned. He was placed on nitro pasteon September , and his intravenous heparin was then stopped on January .The patient was transferred to Hard Hospital on Januarybecause he preferred to receive his care from his primarycardiologist. He denies having any chest pain since his initialpain on the seventh. He also denies shortness of breath ,orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , swelling , nausea ,vomiting , or diaphoresis. He has been tolerating a regular diet.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease status post MIin 1998 , and two-vessel CABG in 1998.2. Exercise induced atrial fibrillationnoted in 1990 with no recurrence.3. Prostate carcinoma status postprostatectomy in 1986.4. Malaria in 1944.MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mgq.d. , nitro paste started at the outside hospital.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was recently widowed approximatelytwo months ago , and has been grieving. He isclose with his daughter. He denies any use of tobacco or alcohol.CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: No tobacco , no hypertension , no familyhistory of significant cardiac disease , andno known history of hypercholesterolemia.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a pleasant elderly man in no acutedistress , who was sitting up in bed. Vitalsigns: the patient was afebrile with blood pressure 115/60. Heartrate was 67. Respiration was 18. Room air saturation was 94%.HEENT exam showed the patient to be anicteric , with intactextraocular movements , and moist mucus membranes. The neck wassupple with jugular venous pressure noted , approximately 8centimeters. The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally withno rales or wheezes.The coronary exam showed regular rate and rhythm , with a 1/6midsystolic murmur at the left sternal border , and no S3.The abdominal examination showed a flat abdomen with active bowelsounds , and a well-healed midline low abdominal scar consistentwith his prior prostatectomy. No masses or hepatosplenomegaly werenoted.The extremity exam showed no edema , with 2+ femoral and posteriortibial pulses bilaterally , and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulsesbilaterally.On neurologic exam , the patient was alert and oriented times threewith cranial nerves III through XII intact and symmetric. Themotor examination was 5/5 throughout , with 1+ deep tendon reflexesand downgoing toes bilaterally.LABORATORIES AT THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL: CPK at admission was 2611 ,with an MB fraction of 260.Sodium 139 , potassium 4.9 , chloride 100 , CO2 30 , BUN 20 , creatinine1.0 , glucose 123. The white blood cell count was 8.4 , with ahematocrit of 40 , and platelets of 160. LDH is 162. AST is 26.The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , with normal intervals. Theprior ST depressions had resolved , and there were Q waves in V1 andV2. The T waves were flattened in V5 and V6.HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiac: the patient remained off of his heparindrip and on his nitro paste , and had no furtherepisodes of chest pain or shortness of breath. He underwent anechocardiogram , which revealed an ejection fraction of 45 to 50% ,and posterior/lateral hypokinesis in the left ventricle. Therewere no valvular abnormalities. Because the patient had no furtherepisodes of chest pain , he did not undergo further evaluation , andwas discharged home. The plan is for him to undergo anotherexercise test in approximately 3 to 4 weeks.ID: The patient developed a temperature of 101.1 on his first dayof admission. He presented with a Foley catheter in place , whichwas removed. A urinalysis and culture were negative. Bloodcultures were drawn and were negative , and a chest x-ray was normalas well.On hospital day number three , the patient was noted to have anon-pruritic , non-painful , erythematous rash on the back of hislower right buttock and the back of his right leg. The patientclaimed that this rash was completely asymptomatic , and he wouldnot know about it if no one had pointed it out.On hospital day number four , it was noted that this rash had filledup a dermatomal pattern on the back of his right leg , and it wasfelt that this most likely represented an acute outbreak of herpeszoster. The patient was not treated specifically for herpes , giventhat he was asymptomatic , and we did not have any proven diagnosis.However , we were confident enough of this that we felt that itwould explain his low grade temperatures.Psych: The patient spoke openly about his sadness following theloss of his wife , two months ago. He was seen by Social Services ,as well as by the Souzion Hospital , who thought that the patientwas appropriately grieving , and appropriately sad. It was feltthat at the time of discharge , that the patient had proper socialsupport at home , and was properly responding to the death of hiswife. It was therefore felt that he did not need any acutepsychiatric evaluation.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home , in stable conditionon hospital day four. He will follow-up with hiscardiologist , Dr. Semprini , in approximately 5 days. He will be seenby the Visiting Nurses Association , approximately two times a week ,to check both his blood pressure and cardiac status , as well tohelp insure that he is not developing a more severe depression.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The discharge medications include atenolol25 mg p.o. q. a.m. and 12.5 mg p.o. q.p.m. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 2.5 mgp.o. q. evening , and Pravachol 10 mg p.o. q. h.s.The patient had been tolerating this regiment of medications at thetime of discharge.Dictated By: DWAIN BIONDOLILLO , M.D. TT96Attending: VON SIFFORD , M.D. KK10RT312/8223Batch: 29186 Index No. SCKJQB9823 D: 2/13/98T: 11/5/98

RIGHT-SIDED CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT.OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1. TYPE II DIABETES.2. HYPERTENSION.3. RIGHT SHOULDER PAIN.4. HOOK WORM ENTERITIS.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63 year-old Hispanicman with a history of a left-sidedcerebrovascular accident , with a dense right hemiparesis , whopresented to the Emergency Room at Villera Hospital Medical Center on17 of September , complaining of left-sided facial numbness , and left upperextremity numbness since awakening that morning. The patient has ahistory of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertensionand hyperlipidemia , as well as a past history of a left hemisphericstroke with a right-sided hemiparesis , who awoke the morning ofadmission with left lip numbness. Over the subsequent few hours ,the patient's numbness progressed to include the entire leftone-half of his face. By 10 o'clock in the morning , his entireleft arm was also numb. His left lower extremity was alsoinvolved. In the Emergency Room , an EKG was done , and revealedsubtle ST segment depressions in leads II , and V4 through V6 , aswell as .5 mm of ST depression in lead I. There were no comparisonEKGs available. The patient denied any chest pain , shortness ofbreath , nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis. Given his history ofmyocardial infarction that he states may have occurred in the past ,as well as numerous coronary risk factors , he was admitted for ruleout of myocardial infarction and evaluation of his left-sidednumbness.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q.d. ,Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Dyazide.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for: ( 1 ) Left-sidedcerebrovascular accident in 1989. ( 2 )Hypertension. ( 3 ) Chronic right upper extremity pain after hisinitial cerebrovascular accident. ( 4 ) Type II diabetes.ALLERGIES: Penicillin , with unknown reaction.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a resident of Et ,Call Eansirancea . He denies alcohol or tobacco use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a thin , Hispanic male in noacute distress , and pleasant. His vitalsigns were: Blood pressure 150/88 , with a pulse of 86 , and arespiratory rate of 20. His saturation was 96% on room air. Histemperature was 98.4. HEENT: Pupils equal , round , reactive tolight and accommodation; extraocular muscles intact. Pharynx wasclear. Neck was supple without adenopathy. There was no increasedjugular venous pressure. Lungs were clear to auscultationbilaterally , with the exception of mild bibasilar crackles.Cardiac exam showed regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI systolicejection murmur at the left lower sternal border , with radiation tothe left axilla. Abdomen was soft , non-tender , with positive bowelsounds. Extremities were without cyanosis , clubbing or edema.There were no cords and no Homan's sign was present. Onneurological exam , the patient showed cranial nerves II through XIIgrossly intact. The patient did , however , have loss of the rightshoulder shrug. On motor exam , the patient was 5/5 in all majormuscle groups on the left-hand side , and 4/5 in all major musclegroups on the right-hand side. The patient was also somewhathyperreflexic on the right upper and lower extremities. Babinskiwas down going on the right , and withdrawal on the left. Onsensory exam , the patient had decreased pin prick on the leftaspect of the fact , from V1 to V3 , and numbness of the left upperextremity. Light touch was intact bilaterally. Proprioception wasalso intact bilaterally.LABORATORY DATA ( on admission ): Included a potassium of 3.4 , a BUNof 13 , a creatinine of 0.8 , aglucose of 226. His white blood cell count was 6.3; his hematocritwas 44.9 , and his platelet count was 196. AST and ALT were 21 and31 , respectively. LDH was 155. Total bilirubin was 0.5.Cholesterol was 201. Calcium was 10.2 , with an albumin of 4.7.EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 75 , with .5 mm of STsegment depression in lead I , and 1 mm of ST depression in leads IIand V4 through V6. Chest x-ray was clear bilaterally. There wascardiomegaly present. There was question of a left lower lobeopacity. There were no signs of congestive heart failure. Head CTwithout contrast showed an old left centrum semiovale lesion ,consistent with with a watershed infarct. There was no evidence ofacute bleed.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 63 year-old Hispanic male withthe following important medical issues to bemanaged:( 1 ) Cardiovascular. The patient presented without chest pain , butEKG changes , including .5 mm of ST segment depression in lead I ,and 1 mm of ST segment depression in leads II , and V4 through V6.There was no prior EKG for comparison. Given his multiple cardiacrisk factors , a decision was made to rule the patient out formyocardial infarction. His serial creatinine kinase levels were67/74/115. Given the low levels , there was no MB fractionationdone. The patient also was placed on Holter monitor to attempt torule out a dysrhythmic etiology of his deficit. Holter showedpredominantly a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 442 to 98. Therewere 7 atrial premature beats , and 5 ventricular premature beats ,as well as a 12-beat run of supraventricular tachycardia at a rateof 125 , and a 6-beat run of ventricular tachycardia at 144. All ofthese were asymptomatic. The patient underwent transthoracicechocardiography while an inpatient , to rule out a vegetativesource of emboli , which may have resulted in his change insensation. Echocardiogram demonstrated concentric left ventricularhypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 65%. There was athickened aortic leaflet with calcification of the right and leftcoronary cusps of the aortic valve. No shunt was visualized. Thepatient had no occurrence of chest pain or shortness of breathwhile admitted to the Louili Mi Hospital . These eventswere thought to be entirely non-cardiac in nature , and he wasremoved from Telemetry. The patient's hypertension was managedwith Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. during this admission , andswitched to 30 mg of Nifedipine XL p.o. q.d. as an outpatient. Hisblood pressure should be followed as an outpatient , and additionsand adjustments made accordingly.( 2 ) Neurologic. The patient was admitted with what appeared to bea purse sensory defect of the right hemisphere , resulting in leftfacial and upper extremity numbness. He was seen in consultationby the Neurology Service. CT scan of the head without contrast inthe Emergency Room was negative for acute bleed. In the EmergencyRoom , the patient received one enteric coated aspirin , and he wasnot started on intravenous heparinization. It was unclear ,initially , whether the etiology of this patient's change inneurological status was secondary to embolic phenomena or possiblya second watershed infarct. Given his negative echocardiogram ofthe heart , as well as a negative Holter monitor , it was thoughtthat the etiology of this patient's left-sided facial numbness wasnot cardiac in nature. It was the feeling of the Neurology Servicethat the patient had experienced a right-sided subcortical infarct ,probably in the right thalamus region. He was also noted to haverisk factors for small vessel disease , including hypertension anddiabetes. His numbness appeared to be resolving on aspirin alone;however , on the second day of admission , the patient began todevelop dysarthria. There was concern that the patient was havingan evolving cerebrovascular accident that was involving thebrainstem , given tongue involvement. He was thus started onintravenous heparinization. His dysarthria promptly resolved. Heunderwent MRI with and without contrast of the head , three daysafter the initial event , which demonstrated only right-sided smallvessel disease. There was no evidence of acute bleed or underlyingvascular abnormality. Given the small vessel disease in thispatient , he was taken off intravenous heparin and continued on oneaspirin a day. He did well during the remainder of his stay. Hewas seen in consultation by Physical Therapy and OccupationalTherapy , who , in conjunction with the patient's family , believedthat he was at a somewhat decreased level of functioning from hisbaseline , given his sensory changes. He is thus to be sent forinpatient rehabilitation for his new cerebrovascular accident , andthen to be followed as an outpatient in Dr. Lacrosse 's clinic. Hewill continue on one aspirin a day for life. His right-sidedscapular and shoulder pain is chronic , after sustaining his initialleft-sided cerebrovascular accident. It should be treated withphysical therapy , including ultrasound and stretching maneuvers.The patient was also placed on Naproxen for pain relief.Muscle relaxants may be tried as an outpatient if the above statedefforts do not help reduce this patient's pain.( 3 ) Infectious disease. This patient had no infectiouscomplications while hospitalized. He was , however , found to have aslight peripheral eosinophilia during this admission , and wasevaluated by O&P of the stool. Stool evaluation showed moderatehook worm eggs , as well as rare Trichuris trichiura eggs. He wastreated with three days of Mebendazole.( 4 ) Endocrine. The patient has a history of Type II diabetes , onDiabeta. The patient's blood glucose levels were checked by fingerstick four times daily , and were in the 190's to 240's range duringthis admission. He was covered with a CZI sliding scale of regularinsulin. The patient was advised by Dietary on the AmericanDiabetic Association diet. He is to continue as an outpatient onGlyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.;Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Glyburide 5mg p.o. b.i.d.; Naprosyn 375 mg p.o. b.i.d. , with meals; NifedipineXL 30 mg p.o. q.d.; sublingual nitroglycerin 1/150 , one tabletsublingually q.5 minutes times three , then call M.D.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on 19 of July torehabilitation at Sco Hospital .FOLLOW UP: He is to follow up in clinic with Dr. Hiers in EEN MEDICAL CENTER ,at his first available appointment.COMPLICATIONS: There were no complications during this stay.Dictated By: SAM MINALGA , M.D.Attending: EDMOND H.

Thesewere characterized by emesis followed by loss of consciousness witha question of seizure like activity. This had occurred on a yearlybasis for 8-10 years. Such an episode occurred on May At thattime , his mother brought him to the Harwelliew Oker Medical Centers Emergency Roombecause he developed a facial hematoma after one of these episodes.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In the Emergency Room he was noted to besomewhat groggy with a brief episode ofapparent loss of consciousness with a question of apnea. He wassent to head CT for a scan and at that time he vomiting with lossof consciousness and a decrease in heart rate to 30 beats perminute. He was intubated in the CT scan room , sedated and paralyzedwhile the study was completed. When he arrived in the IntensiveCare Unit , he had a heart beat in the 20s with complete heartblock , which was transient and with subsequent return to normalsinus rhythm. The remainder of his exam was remarkable for an S4and I/VI systolic ejection murmur. NEURO: The neurological exam wasnonfocal.LABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes were normal. His EKG showed sinustachycardia with an axis of 0 , ST flattening inleads V5 and V6 , I in L and a question of a Q in III. Chest X-rayraised the question of an infiltrate in the left base. The head CTwas negative. His course in the MICU was as follows: He ruled outfor myocardial infarction , despite an elevated CK. The MB fractionwas negative on electrophoresis. On the morning of February , hespiked a temperature to 102.3 and was begun on Penicillin. Later onFebruary he had an episode of complete heart block with asystole for9 seconds. Otherwise , he alternated sinus tachycardia and seconddegree heart block with runs of bradycardia at the rate of 30-40and also tachycardia.HOSPITAL COURSE: A temporary pacemaker was placed on Februarythrough the left subclavian approach. At thattime , he was hemodynamically stable , except for intermittenthypertension , which was treated with Nifedipine. He wastransferred to the Cardiology Wa Nas O on January , 1993 to awaitpacemaker placement. He was switched from Nifedipine to Captoprilfor treatment of his hypertension and his fever was treated withCefotetan for presumed aspiration pneumonia. This has resulted in adelay in his pacemaker placement. He intermittently had apericardial friction rub on physical examination that was thoughtto be most likely due to myocardial irritation by the pacing wireimplantation. One echocardiogram in a series did reveal a regionalwall motion abnormality that may have been a function of thepacemaker wire as well. He remained afebrile and completed a courseof antibiotics for his presumed aspiration pneumonia , althoughsubsequent chest x-rays did not support that diagnosis. Herequired replacement of his temporary pacemaker wire while awaitingpermanent pacemaker placement to decrease the risk of infection.He underwent permanent pacemaker placement in the Operating Roomwith anesthesia backup in case there was need for intubationbecause the patient had difficulty remaining still. The pacemakerreplacement was performed on July , 1993. Intubation was notnecessary.DISPOSITION: He tolerated the procedure well and was discharged tohome on May , 1993. MEDICATIONS: The medications atdischarge were: Kefzol 500mg q.i.d. for 3 days , and Lisinopril 10mgp.o. q day. He will followup with Dr. Antis on March , 1993 and inTYTAZE TH IONO VALLEY HEALTH with Dr. Filiberto Schie Secondary Diagnoses were pacemakerplacement and Down's syndrome.Dictated By: OLIN E.

LEG | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 9/2/1999 Report Status: SignedDischarge Date: 8/27/1999HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year old gentlemanwho has a past medical history ofnon-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease ,and peripheral vascular disease who had a revascularizationprocedure with a left femoral popliteal bypass graft in August of1998. Since that time his foot has become cool and the graft hasbeen noted to be occluded. He presents for a re-operation forrevascularization.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.Coronary artery disease status post coronaryartery bypass graft in 1991 and series of angioplasties prior tothe coronary artery bypass graft. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.Non-healing left foot ulcer with no osteomyelitis. Hypertension.Peripheral vascular disease.MEDICATIONS: Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Glucophage 850 mg p.o.t.i.d. , Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mgp.o. q.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Simvastatin 10mg p.o. q.d. , and NPH 10 units subcu q.p.m.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: In 1991 he had a coronary artery bypassgraft. His postoperative course wascomplicated only by atrial fibrillation which was medically managedand he has been without recurrence since that time. In August of1998 he had a left superficial femoral artery to anterior tibialartery bypass graft with non-reversed greater saphenous vein andleft common femoral endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty ,as well as debridement of the left lateral foot wound. After thissurgery , he had an uncomplicated postoperative course.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient quit smoking in the fall of 1998 anddoes not use alcohol.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has had no chest pain , shortness of breath ,or angina since the time of his bypass. Justprior to his admission , he was seen by Dr. Frankie Krampitz of Harlsti Conon Memorial Medical Center cardiology and was cleared from a cardiacstandpoint saying that he was an average risk for surgery as he hasdone well from his prior surgeries and has had no symptoms sincehis bypass surgery. Additionally , his preoperative angiogramshowed his superficial femoral artery graft to be proximallyoccluded with mid to distal reconstitution. Above the kneepopliteal artery , there was mild diffuse disease. Below the kneepopliteal was patent. There was diffuse proximal disease in theperoneal and posterior tibial arteries. The posterior tibialoccludes above the knee and there is high grade focal stenosis atthe anterior tibial origin. The dorsalis pedis is patent.HOSPITAL COURSE: On 2/10/99 the patient was brought to theoperating room where Dr. Moises performed a leftfemoral above-the-knee popliteal bypass graft. This went withoutcomplications. The type of graft used as a 6 mm Dalcron graft.The immediate postoperative pulse examination was notable for apalpable femoral popliteal and graft pulse with a Dopplerabledorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse on left side. Thepatient had an ECG postoperatively that showed no significantchange to his preoperative ECG. He was started on heparin at 8p.m. the day of surgery.Of note , on postoperative day #1 , the patient got very diaphoreticand nauseous. At that time an ECG was done that showed nosignificant change and , throughout that episode , he had nohemodynamic instability. This was likely secondary to havinggotten up rather quickly and likely a vasovagal event.Throughout the rest of his hospitalization course the patient wasmobilized with physical therapy. He had a Dopplerable dorsalispedis pulse , posterior tibial pulse , and peroneal pulse on leftside throughout his entire hospital course. However , the graft wasno longer palpable by postoperative day #2 but it was stronglyDopplerable.The patient was continued on heparin until his Coumadin reached thehigh 1 level which was achieved on 1/25/99 when his INR was 1.6. Atthis time his heparin was discontinued. The anticoagulation is onfor keeping the graft patent and not for any cardiac or strokereasons. The goal on his INR will be approximately 2 to 2.5. On1/25/99 the patient was stable for discharge. His pulse examinationwas notable for Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posteriortibial pulse and peroneal pulse.The patient's record of Coumadin in response with INR is asfollows: On 2/10/99 the patient was started on Coumadin at whichpoint his INR was 1.0. On that day he got 5 mg of Coumadin. Thefollowing day , 5/27/99 , his INR was 1.1 and he got another 5 mg ofCoumadin. On 8/17/99 the patient's INR was 1.2 and he got another 5mg of Coumadin. On 10/15/99 the patient got 7.5 mg of Coumadin andhis INR was 1.2 at that time. On 6/8/99 the patient got 10 mg ofCoumadin and his INR was 1.6 the following day on the day ofdischarge , 1/3/99. On the day of discharge , 1/25/99 , the patientwill get 7.5 mg of Coumadin and his predicted daily dose will beroughly 7.5 mg of Coumadin p.o. q.d.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mgp.o. q.d.

SYNCOPE.2. ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION.3. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.4. DIABETES MELLITUS.5. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old white male withinsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy who wasadmitted with syncope. He is status post myocardial infarction in1979 and 1985 as well as a coronary artery bypass graft in 1987with a LIMA to LAD , SVG to RCA , SVG to OMB. Over the past tenyears he has complained of increasing CHF symptoms includingdyspnea on exertion , fatigue , chest tightness and has had multipleadmits for exacerbations , the most recent from November toMarch , 2001 for progressive fatigue. At that time a rightheart catheterization revealed high filling pressures and he wastreated with aggressive diuresis. Angiography revealed occludedSVGs and a patent LIMA. Dobutamine radionuclide study revealedinferior and inferolateral infarct. There was no evidence ofrevascularization. Evaluation for heart transplant found cirrhosisby liver spleen scan which ruled out the possibility of transplant.He reported light-headedness and dizziness and was seen by theElectrophysiology Service who performed an EP study which wasnegative for provokable VT and since he is not a transplantcandidate it was felt that empiric ICD placement would not be inhis best interest. His light-headedness and presyncope worsened.His captopril dose was reduced from 37.5 mg to 25 mg t.i.d. withmarked improvement in his energy and less dizziness. Over the pastweeks his dizziness and light-headedness recurred and worsened withepisodes of presyncope and frank syncope. On the day of admissionhe was scheduled for a clinic appointment. On arrival he feltdizzy and "crumpled" with loss of consciousness and therefore wasadmitted for further evaluation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejectionfraction of 15% to 20% in February of 2001 ,status post anterior MI in 1980 and 1986 , three vessel CABG in 1987with LIMA to LAD , SVG to OM and SVG to PDA , type 2 diabetesmellitus , insulin dependent , hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis ,gallstones , cardiac cirrhosis which is mild and was diagnosed inFebruary 2001 by abdominal ultrasound and liver scan , IBS , psoriasis.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mgp.o. t.i.d. , Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , NPHinsulin 65 units subcu b.i.d. , Xanax p.r.n. , torsemide 120 mg p.o.q.a.m. , torsemide 80 mg p.o. q.p.m. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. ,Synthroid 250 mcg p.o. q.d. , Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Lying blood pressure94/58 , heart rate 70 , oxygensaturation 97% on room air. Sitting blood pressure 78/54. Patientcould not stand secondary to light-headedness to completeorthostatic vital signs. Afebrile. General: Appearingcomfortable in a supine position. No acute distress.Cardiovascular: Regular. Normal S1 , S2. No S3. JVPapproximately 5 cm. A II/VI holosystolic murmur at apex. Lungs:Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , non-tender ,nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly.

White blood cell count 17.9 , hematocrit 37.6 ,platelets 286.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: None.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 62-year-old white male with history ofinsulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronaryartery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy and probably cardiaccirrhosis who presents with presyncope and syncope. The arrhythmiawas considered possible and there has been none documented and hewas not inducible two years prior to admission. Given hisorthostatic vital signs it was felt that his volume status andmedications were responsible for his symptoms. In addition hiselevated BUN and creatinine were consistent with volume depletion.He improved off diuretics , nitrates and ACE inhibitor as well asliberalization of his diet regarding salt and fluid intake. Therewere no arrhythmias noted on his telemetry monitor. An endocrineconsult was called to evaluate for possible contribution ofautonomic insufficiency secondary to his diabetes mellitus. Theyrecommended decreasing his Synthroid dose due to a suppressed TSHas well as more aggressive blood sugar control , however , they wereunable to document orthostatic hypotension and felt that hisepisodes of presyncope and syncope were related to his volumestatus and medications rather than autonomic insufficiency.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: To be dictated on the actual day ofdischarge.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Satisfactory.DISPOSITION: Home with services.FOLLOW-UP: Primary care provider and cardiologist , Dr. Edgar DerDictated By: JEFFERSON PARIDO , M.D. LE75Attending: OMER A.

He was admitted to the ICU forcareful monitoring and fluid volume managementpostoperatively. He has had multiple abdominal surgeries. Themesh was originally placed for ventral hernia repair in 2005. Hehad since developed draining sinus tracts for which cultures havegrown out MRSA. He was admitted preoperatively for reversal ofanticoagulation and semi-urgent removal of the mesh. In theoperating room , he underwent an exploratory laparotomy , lysis ofadhesions and removal of the abdominal mesh. He was closed andone Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place. During the procedure ,he was intubated with etomidate , succinylcholine and kept sedatedwith Versed and fentanyl. He received intraoperative vancomycinand levofloxacin as well as 2200 mL of lactated Ringer's. In anattempt to reverse anticoagulation , one unit of FFP was begun butthen aborted due to hypotension , which resolved with epinephrineinjection , likely due to transfusion reaction. Another unit ofFFP was hung and tolerated well. EBL was 300 mL. Urine outputwas 410 mL for the four-hour case. He was extubated uneventfullyand transferred to the ICU in stable condition.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Colon cancer , status post colonoscopy in 2005 that wasnegative.2. Prostate cancer.3.

Extremities: Warm and well perfused.IMAGING: Chest x-ray negative for acute disease andcardiomegaly.HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 90+-year-old gentleman with a complexpast medical history including CAD status post MI and stent x2 ,CHF was admitted to the SICU , status post ex lap for removal ofMRSA-infected mesh for careful monitoring and fluid resuscitationin light of cardiac status. His postoperative course wasremarkable for bleeding with sanguinous output from the JP drain ,a question of an abdominal hematoma and a progressive drop in hishematocrit. The heparin drip , which was initiated given thepatient's chronic AF , was discontinued and FFP administered.Platelets were also given at the request of the Plastic SurgeryTeam in light of aspirin and Plavix , which were continued due tothe patient's cardiac stents. Despite bolus Lasix , the patientdid develop CHF with symptomatic pulmonary edema and increasedoxygen requirement. Concomitantly , the patient also becamedelirious , as is his historical pattern with significant agitation.He developed hypertension refractory to beta-blockade , calciumchannel blockers and IV ACE inhibitors in this setting. Thepatient was thus placed on a nitroglycerin drip , a furosemidedrip with ginger blood product resuscitation to address bleedingand an elevated INR. He responded well to this regimen andaggressive pulmonary toilet. Both the patient's PCP , Dr.Gillice , and his cardiologist , Dr. Keks , did follow thepatient. His oxygenation never suffered during this time and hedid not have significant hypercarbia. He was eventually weanedback to nasal cannula. He did have a mild transient elevation increatinine while on the Lasix drip but has since recovered backto baseline off of the Lasix drip. His nasogastric tube wasremoved on 5/18/06 and he tolerated ice chips withoutdifficulty. His home cardiac medications were restarted on6/10/06. The patient was out of bed and ambulating withoutdifficulty. At the time of dictation , his nitroglycerin drip wasbeing weaned with the assistance of nitro paste. He isanticipated to be transferred to the floor once he receives a redblood cell transfusion and once the nitroglycerin drip is off.PLAN:Neuro:1. The patient does sundown at home and has done so while inthe ICU. He has been much more calm and appropriate over thepast 24 to 36 hours.2. He does experience more significant delirium with morphineand less so with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n.3. We will continue with sparing Dilaudid p.r.n. , and Zyprexa2.5 at bedtime p.r.n. per home regimen. Haldol is written p.r.n.as needed.Cardiovascular:1. CAD status post stent x2 , AF on chronic anticoagulation , CHF ,status post pacer for sick sinus syndrome , currently V paced.2.

She felt that her left lower extremity was "asleep" andweak. She called 911 , came to PCH . The patient also noted thather speech seemed slurred at the time that she was unable to getup. She denied any weakness or numbness in her other extremitiesor face. She denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , or visualchanges. She says she did note transient heart palpitations. Shedenied fever , chills , nausea , and vomiting. In the ER the patientwas noted to have 2/5 left lower extremity power. She had noapparent sensory deficits at that time.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , and including noninsulin dependentdiabetes mellitus , a status post left hipreplacement , history of DVT , status post mitral valve replacementfor mitral stenosis approximately eight years ago ( patient says shehas a history of rheumatic fever ) , and bilateral cataracts.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Norvasc 10 mg q. day , amiodarone 200 mgq. day , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 40mg q. day , Coumadin 5 mg Monday , Wednesday , and Friday and 2.5 mgTuesday , Thursday , Saturday , and Sunday , Lomotil 1-2 mg q.i.d.p.r.n. , glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. , and Prinivil 20 mg q. day.SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient denied any history of tobacco , ethanol , orillicit drug use. She lives alone and says she isa very private person.

She has a son that diedof an MI as well.ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to penicillin , sulfa drugs ,and aspirin.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On being admitted to the hospital , thepatient was afebrile at 97.4 degreesFahrenheit , with a pulse of 68 , blood pressure of 190/90 , andsatting 98% on room air. Patient's exam showed that she had nocarotid bruits or JVD. Her heart exam was notable for a regularrate and rhythm , as well as prosthetic S1. Her lungs were clear toauscultation bilaterally and abdominal exam was benign.Extremities showed cool fingers on the right , with a 1+ pulse , andwarm well perfused fingers on the left , with a 2+ radial pulse.Apparently , these extremity changes are long-standing and not new.She had 2+ pulses in her posterior tibial pulses and trace pulsesin her dorsalis pedes pulses bilaterally. On neuro exam thepatient was alert and oriented x three. She exhibited good naming ,comprehension , reading , and fluency. Cranial nerves II-XII wereintact bilaterally. On motor exam the patient had 5/5 powereverywhere except for the left lower extremity , with knee flexors ,knee extensors , ankle flexors , and ankle extensors being 3+/5 andhip flexors and hip extensors being 4-/5. Her tone was slightlyincreased in her left lower extremity. On sensory exam she hadslightly reduced sensation to pinprick , light touch , andtemperature in both extremities to the hip. Deep tendon reflexeswere symmetric and 2+ throughout , with downgoing toes bilaterally.Pertinent labs on admission showed a slightly increased creatinineat 1.7 and a BUN of 31. The patient had a TSH of 1.09 and a totalcholesterol of 197 , with an LDL of 131. Her sed. rate was 14 andher hematocrit was 40.2. INR was noted to be 1.7. CKs were flatand the patient was ruled out for an MI.IMPRESSION:1. Neurologic: Given the patient's significant cardiac historyand subtherapeutic INR , it was considered that her left lowerextremity weakness that was transient was likely a transientischemic attack. The patient's motor deficits quickly improvedover her hospital stay and she felt she was back to baseline on theday of discharge. Head CT and head MRI and MRA were negative forany acute changes , including hemorrhage and infarction. On MRA thepatient was noted to have some proximal stenosis of her rightintracranial carotid and had also some atherosclerotic changes ofher PCAs bilaterally. The patient also had ATTE with a bubblestudy that was negative for PFO. The patient was continued on herCoumadin at 5 mg q.h.s. until her INR was therapeutic. During thisinterval she was started on heparin and was therapeutic on that.The patient is to follow up in the Coumadin clinic as well asneurology clinic in one month. She is to have her Coumadin drawnat three days after discharge to ensure that her INR is above 2.Her Coumadin dosing regimen was slightly changed , with her takingfour doses of 5 mg a week and three doses of 2.5 mg a week. Thepatient was seen by physical therapy , who cleared her to go homeand felt that she was okay to walk stairs with her walker.2. Cardiovascular: The patient has an extensive cardiac historyas detailed above. Her systolic blood pressure was calculatedbetween 120 and 160 during the first day of her hospital stay , asit was unclear whether she had a serious carotid stenosis or not.Her blood pressure meds were gradually added back. The patient hadseveral episodes of atypical chest pain , for which she was ruledout with telemetry and enzymes , which were flat.3. Endocrine: The patient was placed on a diabetic diet and wascontinued on her glyburide. A hemoglobin A1C is pending at thetime of this dictation. She was covered with sliding scale insulinduring her hospital stay.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Amiodarone 200 mg q. day , Norvasc 10 mgq. day , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lasix 40mg q. day , Coumadin 5 mg Monday , Wednesday , Friday , and Sunday , and2.5 mg Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday , glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. ,Lasix 40 mg q. day , and Prinivil 20 mg q. day.Dictated By: COLTON ELMER , M.D. DH188Attending: EMERSON DERMODY , M.D. ZV0WI718/067759Batch: 19504 Index No. WGFGW276TF D: 2/10/01T: 7/26/01

Thepatient has a long history of C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency ,status post emergent tracheostomy times 3 in the distant past , aswell as a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the recentpast. She has failed Quinidine and Propafenone in the past , andshe is maintained in normal sinus rhythm on Sotalol. The patientwas admitted for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with increasedventricular response and was treated with an increased Sotalol doseand converted to normal sinus rhythm without electricalcardioversion. The patient was most recently discharged on10 of January Three days prior to this admission , the patient presentedwith a flu-like illness with a temperature of 103 orally , and shestayed in bed. The next day , she was afebrile and felt better. Onthe day of admission , the patient awoke at 7:00 am with suddenonset of excruciating abdominal pain and she called Meo. Bridbouldma Medical Center She went by ambulance there. She said this pain istypical of her attacks , except was much worse than ever before. Onarrival at Sheph Name Memorial Hospital , the patient was found to behypotensive , clammy , and she was given C1 esterase inhibitor , butremained persistently hypotensive and was transferred to Gic Hospital Her she had a systolic blood pressure of 60and was found to be in atrial fibrillation. A CVL groin line wasplaced and she was given vigorous intravenous fluid hydration. Thepatient was started on Vancomycin , gentamicin and Flagyl to cover apossible bowel source for sepsis. The pains rapidly decreased overthe next 2 hours , typical of her attacks , but still persistedmildly. Her blood pressure stabilized and she remained afebrile.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY included the C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency ,hereditary angioedema , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , history ofsubdural hematoma secondary to Coumadin , status post appendectomy ,status post total abdominal hysterectomy , osteoarthritis.ALLERGIES included multiple foods , sulfa , PCN , Novacaine.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her temperature was 95.8 ,blood pressure 90/palpable , heart rate inthe 120's and irregularly irregular. Head , eyes , ears , nose andthroat examination showed pupils were equal , round , reactive tolight , extraocular movements were intact. Neck was withoutswelling , without stridor , no adenopathy. Lungs were clear. Hearthad S1 , S2 , irregularly irregular. Abdomen was diffusely tender ,positive bowel sounds , no rebound , slightly distended. Rectalexamination was guaiac negative. Neurologic examination showed shewas alert and oriented times 3 , cranial nerves intact.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Significant values included blood ureanitrogen 21 , creatinine 1.3 , white count11 , hematocrit 53.2 , arterial blood gases were pH 7.4 , oxygen 413 ,PCO2 32 , on 100% face mask. Abdominal computerized tomography scanshowed some thickening and some mild edema of her bowel wall , andmoderate to large amount of ascites with no evidence ofperforation. Chest x-ray was clear. The electrocardiogram showedatrial fibrillation at 150 , normal axis and intervals , no ischemicchanges.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and given vigorousintravenous fluids. Her Sotalol dose of 120milligrams twice a day was increased to 160 milligrams twice a day.Her Stanzolol dose of 2 milligrams by mouth every other day wasincreased to 2 milligrams by mouth every 6 hours. The patient wasmonitored very carefully , ruled out for myocardial infarction withflat creatinine phosphokinase levels. Her abdominal pain was goneby the next hospital day , and her electrolytes normalized. Thepatient had some mild diarrhea , which slowly resolved , and sheremained in atrial fibrillation on the increased Sotalol dose. On22 of July , the patient underwent DC-cardioversion and was given 100joules times 2 , and then converted with 200 joules. She remainedin normal sinus rhythm. Her QTC was .467 on her increased dose ofSotalol , and so she was maintained on this. The patient wasdischarged in excellent condition.DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home.

He was discharged yesterday and nowpresents with fevers , chills , shaking , and increasing abdominaldistention. On admission also , noted to have increased sputumproduction and therefore question aspiration event was consideredwhile at rehab. At his recent hospital stay , he was evaluatedfor PFO , which was found to be negative , had no paroxysmal atrialfibrillation , had hypertensive episodes to systolic bloodpressure of 240 , which responded well to hydralazine. Had atroponin leak to peak of 1.94 , which trended down and wasconsidered to be demand related. At baseline , the patient liveswith his wife at home , walks with a walker , and requiresassistance with ADLs. On arrival on the floor , the patient had atemperature of 101.3 , axillary , heart rate 80s to 90s , bloodpressure 180s/80s , and O2 saturation of 97% on three liters. Hisabdomen was found to be quite distended , however not rigid andhad no peritoneal signs.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Right hip fracture status post right hemiarthroplasty.2. Non insulin-dependent diabetes.3. Depression.4. Psoriasis.5. Leiomyoma.6. Hypertension.7. SVT.8. History of GI bleed.9. Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.3to 1.6.10. Embolic stroke in October of 2006.IMPORTANT STUDIES:1. Chest PA and lateral dated 1/10/06 , increased opacificationseen on the lateral view over the lung base concerning forpneumonia , which is probably in the left lower lobe , atelectasiswas seen in the right lung , tiny bilateral pleural effusions arepossible , and heart size is normal.2. Abdominal ultrasound on 3/1/06 : 1 ) Contracted gallbladderwith gallstones. No sonographic evidence for acutecholecystitis. 2 ) Bilateral pleural effusions.3. KUB dated 4/5/06 , no subdiaphragmatic air is seen , nohigh-grade obstruction , and limited study due to motion artifact.4. Urine culture on 4/5/06 , greater than 100 , 000 pansensitiveE. coli.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. The patient was found to have a pansensitive E. coli UTI and aquestionable left lower lobe pneumonia , which would have likelybeen due to aspiration given the patient's recent stroke anddocumented aspiration by Speech and Swallow on previousadmission. The patient's white count , which was initially 19.8on the day of admission trended down over the first three days ofhis admission as he was treated with Levaquin. The Levaquin ,which will cover both the urinary tract infection and thepossibility of aspiration pneumonia will be continued for a totalof a 14-day course to end on 11/16/06. The patient's bloodcultures showed no growth.2. GU , the patient was found to have 1.5 mL of urine in hisbladder when he was admitted indicating significant urinaryretention. A Foley was placed and the patient drained the urine.The patient was started on Flomax to improve his recovery fromthe urethral obstruction. Most likely , the patient hasunderlying urinary retention that was exacerbated by his recentFoley placement during his previous admission. Then when he wentto rehab without the Foley ( note he did void several times priorto discharge from the hospital ). The patient developed urinaryobstruction likely contributing to his urinary tract infectionand requiring readmission. The Foley was kept in place untilhospital day four. When the Foley was taken out , the patient didnot void at all. A bladder scan ten hours after the Foley wastaken out revealed 432 mL of urine in his bladder. A Foley wasreplaced in his bladder and Urology was consulted. Urologyrecommended bladder rest for seven days meaning that the Foleyshould be left in place for seven days and then he is to followup with Dr. Booker Randgaard with the Foley still in place for avoiding trial within a week after discharge.3. Renal , the patient's creatinine at admission was 2.2 , whichis significantly above his baseline. This was attributed toacute renal failure secondary to the urinary obstruction. Whenthe Foley was placed , his creatinine steadily declined , and onthe day prior to discharge was 1.2 , which is within his normalrange.4. Cardiovascular , the patient continued to be hypertensive withSBPs greater than 200 , particularly at night. Therefore , duringhis hospital course , his blood pressure regimen was titrated upsuch that at the time of discharge , his blood pressure regimen isLopressor 50 q.i.d. and Norvasc 10 daily. Blood pressures during24 hours prior to discharge ranged from 110 to 140/70s and hisheart rate ranged 64 to 82.5. Endocrine , the patient was treated with insulin and his p.o.regimen while inhouse and this can be continued at rehab. Hewill be discharged on Lantus 12 , NovoLog sliding scale , andtolbutamide 500 daily.6. GI , the patient had a steadily rising alk phos through thecourse of his hospital stay. At admission , it was 206 and itrose to 508. A GGT was drawn and found to also be elevated at119 , therefore a right upper quadrant ultrasound was completed ,which showed a contracted gallbladder with gallstones but noacute cholecystitis. The patient was found to be constipated onthe day prior to discharge and was given a Dulcolax suppository ,which had worked in the past.7. Prophylaxis , the patient received Lovenox subcu daily.CODE STATUS: The patient is DNI though he would want to beresuscitated with CPR , defibrillated , and given pressors.CONTACT INFORMATION: His son , Dr. Olen Stroebel , can be contactedat 471-446-0880 or 167-100-0595.

Her chestx ray was negative , she was not having fevers and her white blood count wasnormal. Her steroids and levofloxacin/clindamycin were thereforediscontinued and she received her home inhalers and nebulizers only. Sheremained stable on this regimen throughout her hospital stay. Her breathsounds and heart sounds were admittedly a bit distant and she may have anelement of undiagnosed COPD , so pulmonary function tests were recommendedas an outpatient. Additionally , the patient may benefit from a sleep studyas an outpatient given her component of desaturation while asymptomatic andsleeping during the night of admission.2 ) Infectious disease. The patient did have an apparent urinary tractinfection and so was treated with ciprofloxacin 250mg twice daily for threedays.3 ) Cardiovascular. The pt did report some symptoms of PND and orthopnea ,which appeared to be stable for the last several years. She was not volumeoverloaded on exam. She received an echocardiogram to investigate possiblecardiomyopathy or congestive failure , and this showed a normal ejectionfraction without obvious structural abnormalities except for mild bilateralatrial dilatation.4 ) Neurological. The inpatient medical team communicated with the ptsoutpatient neurologist to discuss continued seizures in the context ofquestionable intermittent noncompliance. Per the instructions of herneurologist , the pts dilantin was increased to 230mg PO QAM and 200mg POQPM with plans to check another dilantin level on Friday March ( fivedays after increasing dose ). Her neurontin dose was also increased to 600mgthree times daily.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1 ) Please draw dilantin level on Friday 4/3/07 and send results tooutpatient primary care physician and outpatient neurologist.2 ) Please help pt with medication teaching , especially as regardsanti-epileptics ( dilantin , neurontin ) in order to improve outptcompliance and reduce frequency of seizures.DISCHARGE CONDITION: StableTO DO/PLAN:1 ) Please follow up dilantin level to be drawn by VNA on Friday 10/21/07.2 ) Consider PFTs/sleep study as outpt.No dictated summaryENTERED BY: ANCELL , JR , GIUSEPPE W. , M.D. ( ES28 ) 3/26/07 @ 04****** END OF DISCHARGE ORDERS ******

Her lungs were clear bilaterally.The heart exam was regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs orgallops. Abdomen was diffusely tender to deep palpation , however ,soft active bowel sounds , no rebound , no peritoneal findings. Wellhealed midline incision , no drainage , no erythema. Extremities arenontender without edema.LABS ON ADMISSION: Included a sodium of 145 , a K of 4.5 , chlorideof 99 , bicarb of 31 , and BUN and creatinine of9/0.7 and a glucose of 103 , white count of 10.9 , with plateletcount of 508 and a hematocrit of 41.6. Her UA showed 5 to 10 whitecells , 3 to 7 red cells and 1 + grams. KUB showed a large amountof stool in the large bowel , no free air , a few air fluid levels ,overall picture was not consistent with small bowel obstruction.The patient was admitted with a question of gastroenteritis vs.partial small bowel obstruction , which would be early. She wasadmitted and kept NPO for bowel rash to receive the IV fluids. NoNG tube was placed. On hospital day one , the patient wascomplaining of abdominal crampiness and feeling nauseated. She hada small amount of emesis. She had spiked a temperature of 101.2.This was felt to still either be consistent with the flu , or ileus.A fever work up was then begun. She had blood cultures that weresent , repeat KUB and a repeat CBC. By the afternoon , the patientwas feeling a little bit better.Her CBC that was drawn early in the morning , had a white count of10.38 , a hematocrit of 38.4 , and a platelet count of 422. She hada normal amylase at 57 , normal lipase at 15 , normal LFT's with anALT of 18 , ASC of 20 , and LVH of 290 and alk. phos. of 81 and totaland direct bilirubin of .3 and .2. Her SMA 7 showed the sodium of138 and a K of 4.3. Her BUN and creatinine of 8/.8 , bicarb of 28and a glucose of 107. Her KUB and upright that was repeated stillshowed a large amount of stool in the large bowel , few air fluidlevels but no change from the earlier exam.On hospital day three , the patient's fever curve had improved. Thecultures that were previously sent were no growth so far and theseremained negative throughout the course of the hospitalization. Shewas tolerating clears over the course of the morning. However ,later on in the day , her pain returned , mainly in the right upperquadrant , right lower quadrant. At this point , the decision wasmade to check a CT scan. Of note , when the patient was admitted andhad a temperature spike , she was placed on stress post steroidsgiven her history of Prednisone. This was maintained throughouther hospitalization.Her CT scan showed that there was contrast seen through the smallbowel and colon to the rectum. There was a small section of smallbowel with wall thickening at the paraumbilical level with fluidaround it and no absence of small bowel obstruction. No edema inthe colon , with a small amount of free fluid around the liver andthe pericolic gutters. This raised concern although these findingscould be consistent with small bowl obstruction , to erase concernabout ischemia. However , the patient's exam had improvedremarkably by the morning of the 22 of June Her abdomen was soft , withactive bowel sounds and the patient was only mildly tender. Giventhat the exam was not quite consistent with the CT readings , otherthings were considered in the differential. Of note , the patienthad a couple of loose stools and stool cultures were sent. He doeshave a history of salmonella in the past. These cultures werenegative and included SSYC and C. diff.The concern was raised on the 24 of June that if this was not consistentwith ischemic bowel , that perhaps this was an exacerbation of hervasculitis and could represent vasculitic changes in her SMAcirculation which had improved because the patient was placed onstress post steroids. An angiogram was performed and the findingswere as followed: The aortoiliac artery and SMA were normal inappearance. There was no evidence of microaneurysm , narrowing ordilation. Because of these findings , it was felt that this wasnot a picture consistent with vasculitis. She was switched fromher Hydrocortisone to her usual Prednisone dose of 10 mg. q d onthe 5 of August , the day prior to discharge.The patient did well overnight , tolerated clears in the morning ,and by lunch time , was able to eat a full diet. Of note , thepatient the night prior to discharge , had a complaint of some calfpain which was transient in nature. However , although her exam wasunremarkable , lower extremity noninvasives were done and these werenegative. So the patient is being discharged home in goodcondition. She is tolerating a regular diet.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include Insulin , Procardia XL 60 mg. qd , Axid 150 mg. bid , Prednisone 10 mg.q d.Dictated By: EMMITT HARTSE , M.D. ZQ1Attending: MATTHEW K.

The patient tolerated theprocedure well but immediately postoperatively the patient wasnoted to have non-Dopplerable signals in his left foot. Thepatient was brought back to the operating room at which time thesignificant sized clot was found in the distal anastomosis of thegraft which was removed. Again , the patient was returned to therecovery room and , in the ensuing hours , the patient again lost allDopplerable signals in his left foot. On postoperative day #1 thepatient returned one more time to the operating room for revisionof his left bypass graft. The patient tolerated the procedure welland had strong Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posteriortibial pulse throughout the remainder of his hospital stay. Thepatient was kept on perioperative Ancef antibiotics.On postoperative day #0 the patient was found to be in respiratorydistress. Chest x-ray revealed flash pulmonary edema. Cardiologyconsult was obtained at that time and an echocardiogram revealed anejection fraction of 35 percent with moderate aortic stenosis andregurgitation. The patient ruled in by enzymes for a myocardialinfarction. The patient was kept on beta blocker for goal heartrate less than 75 and was started on Digoxin. Cardiology alsorecommended the addition of an Ace inhibitor for further bloodpressure control. The patient remained stable. He remained in theSurgical Intensive Care Unit for the first three dayspostoperatively at which time the patient was medically stable andtransferred to a surgical floor and monitored bed. Repeatechocardiogram on postoperative day #4 and #3 was unchanged fromhis prior echocardiogram , again , revealing an ejection fraction of35 percent with global hypokinesis , severe aortic stenosis , andmoderate aortic regurgitation. Cardiology continued to follow thepatient throughout his hospital stay. They recommended the patientreturn for cardiac catheterization following a short stay in acuterehabilitation. Otherwise the patient progressed well. He diddevelop a small amount of erythema in his left lower extremityincision site. He was restarted on antibiotics and the erythemaslowly regressed over the ensuing three days. Otherwise thepatient's incisions to his right arm , left leg , and right leg allwere clean , dry , and intact with staples.Physical therapy consult was obtained and the patient was able toambulate with the assistance of a walker. The patient continued toprogress well. He tolerated a regular diet and ambulated andvoided without difficulty.

She was alertand oriented to person , but not to time and confused about theplace. She was unable to carry on a conversation and unable tokeep attentive. Her strength was 5/5 and her sensation was intact.LABORATORY: Laboratory data was remarkable for a sodium of 130 ,potassium 4.9 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 17 , BUN 9 ,creatinine 0.8 and glucose 100. Her ALT was 16 , AST 72 , alkalinephosphatase 118 , amylase 15 and lipase 33. Her ammonia level was45 , albumin 3.2 , total bilirubin 2.4. Her hematocrit was 29.1.Her INR was 1.4. EKG was normal sinus rhythm. Abdominal CT scanshowed that she had no abscess , no obstruction , no acute abdominalprocess.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Gastrointestinal: At the time of admission ,it was a confusing picture for increasedabdominal girth , however the CT scan showed that she had verylittle ascites and on examination , little tenderness. Therefore ,she got a paracentesis which was negative for spontaneous bacterialperitonitis. The patient was treated with cefotaxime and Flagylfor possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , continued on thelactulose and her diuretics. However , the patient much improvedfrom the gastrointestinal standpoint and after resolution of herinfectious picture ( see below ) , the patient was doing incrediblywell with spironolactone and Lasix. She has not been able totolerate her beta blocker secondary to hypotension. During herhospitalization , her hematocrit has been stable. Agastrointestinal consult was obtained. I appreciate their input.They recommend to follow up with the Transplant Team. She has anappointment to see the Transplant Team on July , 2002. At thistime , it is recommended that she begin to get work-up for a livertransplant. However , her hematocrit and her INR remained stablethroughout the hospitalization.2 ) Infectious disease: The patient was negative for spontaneousbacterial peritonitis , however on the second day ofhospitalization , she grew out 4/4 bottles with gram positive cocciin pairs which speciated to be Streptococcus Group B. Therefore ,the antibiotics were tailored and she was started on nafcillinintravenously. The patient then had a PICC line placed and shewill continue treatment of two weeks with intravenous penicillin.The patient has been doing very well with resolution of hererythema. Infectious Disease Service consult was obtained. Iappreciate their input. They suggested two weeks of intravenouspenicillin.3 ) Cardiovascular/hematology: Given the swelling of the leg , thepatient had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative forclot. Otherwise , she remained in normal sinus rhythm and nosymptoms of congestive heart failure.4 ) Psychiatry: The patient was very confused , most likelydelirium. Psychiatry input was greatly appreciated. Anotherreason for her confusion was the fact that she was getting muchbenzodiazepines at her rehabilitation before. She was weaned offher benzodiazepines and started on olanzapine and titrated up astolerated. Therefore , we highly recommend avoiding benzodiazepinesin this patient and continue with olanzapine which can take p.r.n.as well as needed.5 ) Vascular: Vascular Surgery followed this patient during herhospitalization and deemed that her splenorenal shunt was workingwell with no evidence of leak.DISPOSITION: The patient is sent to rehabilitation for furthertreatment and finishing of her antibiotic course. Atthis point , she has requested a new primary care physician and thiswill be myself. I will follow her with an appointment in July ,which I have scheduled for her.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Nexium 20 mg p.o. q. day , olanzapine 5mg p.o. q. PM and olanzapine 2.5 mg p.o.q.8h. p.r.n. , Atrovent inhalers , Azmacort , spironolactone 100 mgp.o. b.i.d. , penicillin 3 million units intravenously q.4h. for acomplete course of two weeks , Nico-Derm 14 mg a day topical ,Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. which is to be held if her systolicblood pressure is less than 100 , lactulose 30 ml p.o. t.i.d. ,Motrin p.r.n. for pain and Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day.Dictated By: SHIRLEY SANDBURG , M.D. SH43Attending: TOMAS H.

The patient hadpersistent pancytopenia , which was evaluated in 10/4 with bonemarrow aspirate biopsy , which showed multiple cytogeneticabnormalities with findings consistent with myelodysplasticsyndrome. In 8/14 , she had a nonmyeloblative peripheral bloodstem cell transplant for a match unrelated donor. In 10/18 , shehad lymphocyte infusion. On 5/8 , chimerism study showed 58%donor origin. Repeat chimerism on 8/23/05 showed 100%chimerism. The patient prior to admission for two weeks haddiarrhea , watery in nature. She denied sick contacts , had GIbiopsy in middle of 5/24 that showed focal colitis , withoutsigns of GVHD. The patient was given prescription for steroidsthree days prior to admission , but did not complete or fill theprescription , was admitted from the clinic with significant skinrash that was consistent with graft versus host disease.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Includes breast cancer in 1/25 , myelodysplastic syndrome ,hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia. The patient had isolatedcomplicated migraine headache and has aortic valvular diseasewith aortic insufficiency.ALLERGIES:She describes no allergies to medications.SOCIAL HISTORY:She is divorced with one son , denies alcohol or illicit drugintake.FAMILY HISTORY:Noncontributory.PHYSICAL FINDINGS:On exam vital signs were stable. The patient had drymaculopapular rash over the upper chest and face , also includingthe upper extremities , abdomen , and upper thighs bilaterally ,flat , slightly erythematous. HEENT exam was normal. She had drymucous membranes. Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.Cardiac exam: There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heardbest in the aortic area. Abdomen is soft and nontender. Thereis no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated on clinical exam. She haslarge external hemorrhoids. There is no clubbing , cyanosis , oredema. Neurological exam is nonfocal.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Oncology: The patient has a history of MDS , 11 months statuspost nonmyeloablative transplant. The patient was very slow toengraft and required donor lymphocyte infusion. Most recentchimerism studies on 8/23/05 showed a 100% donor origin. Thepatient had stage III skin GVH confirmed by biopsy on 6/15/05.She had moderate improvement response to Solu-Medrol , which wasstarted on 8/5/05 ( switched to prednisone on 6/11/05 ) andElidel started on 5/22/05. There has been even more improvementin the skin GVH since initiating rapamycin on 8/6Gut GVH/diarrhea. GI biopsy done on 5/10/05 showed grade IIgraft versus host disease in left transverse colon , grade I graftversus host disease in rectum , with no viral cytopathic changes.The patient had no significant decrease in the amount of stoolswith Solu-Medrol , marginal response to rapamycin , now with someimprovement status post three doses of ONTAK. ONTAK was given on6/17/05 , 9/6/05 , and 10/22/05 without adverse events. Thepatient was premedicated with Pepcid , steroids , Benadryl , andTylenol. The only side effect is marked increase in left upperextremity edema ( see cardiovascular section for more details ).Solu-Medrol IV was started 2 mg/kg/day , started on 8/5/05 ,changed to 2 mg/kg by mouth oral steroids on 6/13/05. Begantapering with steroids at 100 mg b.i.d. on 11/18/05 , decreased to80 mg on 8/20/05 , and down to 60 mg twice daily on 10/24/05.Rapamycin was started on 10/10/05 , goal level between 3 and 12.The patient has been therapeutic since initiating therapy. Sheremains on GVH diet , coordinating with dietary and kitchen forcorrect menu. She also has been on lactose-restricted diet thathas helped the stool volume as well.2. Hematology: The patient with no active bleeding wastransfused for hematocrit less than 26 and platelets less than20. She did have intermittent bright red blood and clots instool , most recently on 10/2/05 and 8/25/05. This wasattributed to have large hemorrhoids that were found oncolonoscopy. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout.3. Infectious disease: The patient remained afebrile throughouther hospitalization , maintained on prophylactic medication ofMepron and acyclovir. Cytomegalovirus viral load on 2/7/05 ,8/5/05 , 5/10/05 , and 10/10/05 , all negative. CMV viral loadon 9/6/05 was pending at the time of this dictation. Thepatient is to remain on acyclovir and Mepron once transferred.4. Cardiovascular: The patient remained hemodynamically stable ,did not get hypotensive throughout the admission.5. Extremities: The patient had left upper extremity swelling ,markedly worsened , starting on tacrolimus , as this is known tocause capillary leak syndrome due to an ultrasound of the leftupper extremity on 11/28/05 , which is negative for DVT. Etiologyis likely due to lymphedema secondary to axillary resection whenthe patient had breast cancer and capillary leak syndromeassociated with ONTAK. The patient had an echocardiogram toassess the etiology of peripheral edema , which showed an ejectionfraction of 60% , mild aortic insufficiency , and aortic stenosis ,borderline diastolic dysfunction , normal right heart , and minimalpericardial effusion.6. Pulmonary: The patient had one episode of dyspnea whenspeaking on 11/16/05 , which resolved without further symptomsthroughout the admission. The patient had chest x-ray on10/6/05 , which showed small left pleural effusion without otherabnormalities.7. Gastrointestinal: Mouth , the patient had dry mouth , likely acomponent of graft versus host disease using ice chips and mouthcoat is helpful to her. She should continue this throughout.8. Gut: The patient had persistent loose stools improved ( seeoncology section ). Clostridium difficile testing sent on8/26/05 and 3/5/05 were negative. She had intermittent brightred blood per rectum that was related to external hemorrhoids , asstated above in GI section.Colonoscopy on 5/10/05 revealed stage II GVHD on biopsy with nogross visual evidence of bleed. As the fact now , the patient wasadmitted on 7/16/05 with bright red blood. The colonoscopy wasnotable for large hemorrhagic mucosa , intubating internalhemorrhoids , and at that time biopsies were negative for graftversus host disease. This was on 3/5/05. Liver transaminitison 8/29/05 , likely due to ONTAK would be followed as anoutpatient. The patient also had transient LFT abnormalitieswhen first admitted and has since resolved since discontinuingBactrim. The bilirubin remained normal. The patient wasasymptomatic.9. Rectum: The patient had Anusol as needed for hemorrhoids.She was not a candidate for surgical intervention due toimmunosuppression and infection risk.10. Renal: The patient repeated increasing creatinine to 1.3.She maintained a level of 0.9 to 1.2 throughout the last fewweeks before discharge.11. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient has markedperipheral edema. Diureses worked well. The patient was up to18 kg above admit weight and now she is only 3 kg up from theadmit weight on 10/24/05. She is on Lasix 40 mg twice daily bymouth. This is likely secondary to combination to venousinsufficiency , steroids , and low albumin. In the setting ofONTAK , she was given albumin and Lasix three times daily , whichis no longer needed now that she that would not be pursuing ONTAKtherapy until an outpatient attending decides , otherwise. Sheshould have a goal I/O negative to 1 to 1.5 liters a day.Monitor hemodynamics closely if the patient has been noted to bedehydrated. Encouraged ambulation and for elevation we wereusing Ace bandage like wraps. The patient had electrolytesmonitored and repleaded as needed. Nutrition was following.12. Endocrine: The patient's fingerstick blood sugars were 134and 163 , improved since steroids taper initiated. She remainedon the sliding scale as needed , likely this is due to steroids.13. Dermatology: The patient upon admission had significantinvolvement of skin due to GVH greater than 80% body surface areainvolved. It is improved significantly , as the exam revealedless erythema , darkening rash , and decreased distribution. Thepatient is on GVH medication , as stated in Oncology section. Shealso came in with macerated areas under both breast and wastreated with miconazole powder and had improved by the day ofdischarge.14. Access: The patient had double lumen Hickman catheter ,which is erythematous surrounding exit site. The cuff has beenexposed for months , although the patient has had no fevers , nottender , outpatient attending requested to keep it lying in.SOCIAL DISPOSITION:The patient accepted at Dwan Uoswe Chehamp Hospital Center We had familymeeting on 8/20/05 with all siblings and patient's son agreed ononce the patient is at home , need for increased support ,medication compliance , Mitchel Hursey , social worker from Tinmasca Hospital is following Dr. KringasDISCHARGE CONDITION:Stable.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Include acyclovir , Anusol , Bactroban , prednisone 60 mg by mouthtwice daily , Mepron 750 mg twice daily , Celexa , sirolimus 4 mg bymouth once daily , Caltrate , vitamin D , and Nexium , tacrolimus 1%lotion twice daily to affected skin GVHD areas , and Lasix 40 mgby mouth twice daily.eScription document: 2-7972916 EMSDictated By: ALTO , GARLANDAttending: NEVERSON , JAMAL MARIONDictation ID 5901421D: 8/29/05T: 8/29/05

ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Wolcott is a 42-year-oldgentleman who underwent multipleprocedures on his right knee , who presents for right kneeautologous chondrocyte implantation for a right knee medial femoralcondyle defect. He also presents for an anteromedialization of thetibial tubercle for patellofemoral maltracking.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history is notable forglomerulonephritis with chronic renalinsufficiency , for renal induced hypertension , for insomnia , forasthma , and for gastroesophageal reflux disease.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: His past surgical history is notable forgastric bypass surgery , as well as aperianal abscess that was treated with IV antibiotics , left kneeautologous chondrocyte implantation in August of 1999 , and rightknee osteochondral mosaic plasty in the past in August of 1998.MEDICATION ALLERGIES: None.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: Atenolol 100 mg q.a.m. , verapamil180 mg q.d. , Zaroxolyn 5 mg q.a.m. ,doxepin 150 mg q.h.s. , Valium 10 mg b.i.d. , Percocet , Oxycontin 20mg b.i.d. , and Lasix 2.5 mg q.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his family , he is engaged and worksfor the Wood I EePHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Exam of his right knee shows that hisincisions are well-healed. There is a mildeffusion. Neurologic exam was intact. He had tenderness over themedial femoral condyle.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 3/5 Fordetails of the procedure he underwent , please seethe operative note. In brief , a chondral defect of his right kneeand patellofemoral maltracking were noted. He then subsequentlyunderwent a decompression of his patellofemoral joint via a 4%Fulkerson procedure. He also underwent autologous chondrocyteimplantation to his right knee medial femoral condyle defects. Hetolerated this procedure well. Postoperatively his neurovascularstatus of his limb remained intact. A drain was left in place , andcare was taken to evaluate for compartment syndrome. Nocompartment syndrome did develop. He did receive Coumadinanticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis. He received perioperativeantibiotics. It was noted that the lateral skin flap over hisanterior knee wound was erythematous and he was restarted on Keflexafter his IV antibiotics were discontinued. His postoperativecourse was notable for a worsening and acute onset of renal failureon top of his chronic renal insufficiency. He was evaluated veryclosely and followed by the Renal Consult Service. His creatininedid rise from a baseline of around 4 up to 6.7. At the time ofdischarge , his creatinine had begun to fall and his renal statushad stabilized.He was seen by Physical Therapy , and he was placed in a continuouspassive motion machine to maintain knee motion. He was ambulatedtouch down weightbearing on his right leg. He was to undergo noactive extension of his right knee. He was ready for discharge on10/28/01.

PROTEIN CALORIE MALNUTRITION.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 36-year-old woman with ahistory of morbid obesity and diabetesmellitus with recently diagnosed abdominal wall cellulitis statuspost a three week stay at Tondenpe Wacla Tusfire Hospital . The patient leftAMA from Tal/whit Community Hospital the day of current admission andafter spending several hours at home called the ambulance after sheslipped and fell out of her chair and was unable to get up. Shedenies loss of consciousness , she was found on the floor lying onher back. She denies fever or chills. She does have abdominalpain , denies nausea or vomiting , diarrhea , increased urinaryfrequency or dysuria.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant forobesity and diabetes.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION INCLUDE: Insulin , lisinopril , cephalexin ,Lipitor , cimetidine , Paxil ,metformin.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature of 96.2 , bloodpressure of 121/64 , pulse of124 , respirations 18 , saturation of 97 percent on room air. Ingeneral , she is obese , tachypneic , and uncooperative. HEENT ,supple neck , no jaundice , moist oral mucosa. CV , tachycardicwithout murmur. Lungs , CTA anteriorly. Abdomen , lower abdominalwall with extensive areas of erythema and induration with an openwound 5 x 7 cm , no pus or drainage , tender to palpation.Extremities , bilateral swelling , warmth , and erythema withtenderness. Neurologic , uncooperative for exam , grossly nonfocal.LABORATORY DATA: laboratories on admission are significant for awhite count of 10.57 , hematocrit of 32.7 ,platelets of 437. Chem-7 showed a sodium of 135 , potassium of 4.3 ,chloride of 108 , CO2 of 15 , BUN of 6 , creatinine of 1.2 , glucose of92 , calcium is 7.5. ESR 75 , INR 1.5 , PT 17.3 , PTT 36.1. UA showed3 to 5 white blood cells , 2 to 3 red blood cells , positiveleukocyte esterase , positive nitrates. EKG showed sinustachycardia with a Q-wave in aVF and questionable Q in V4 throughV5 , left axis deviation , a flat T-wave in V2 through V6 , invertedT-wave in 3 , all unchanged from previous. Chest x-ray showed noinfiltrates. An abdominal CT done at SH on 1/10 showed strandingand fluid and gas along the anterior aspect of the abdominal wallwithout evidence of abscess. An echo done at GAH showed normalleft ventricular function without valvular disease , with an EF of64 percent. A surgical pathology report at B showed cellulitiswith ulceration and fat necrosis. Blood cultures at MHC were neverpositive. Lower extremity Doppler on admission negative for clotsabove the knee. CT done at LH was negative for PE.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: ID: The patient was assessed bygeneral surgery in the emergency roomand plastic surgery followed the patient while in-house. It wasthought that the patient did not require any further surgicaldebridement , she is status post two surgical debridements at NCH .It was recommended that she undergo wet-to-dry dressing changes.Originally upon admission to the Irvra Hospital she was given nafcillin ,however , after coming up to the floor she was changed to a regimenof vancomycin , Cefotan and Flagyl as per ID recommendation at HOM ,this is the regimen the patient was receiving at OMH . Her bloodcultures , of note , were never positive. It was recommended by theID service that the patient does need an abdominal CT to rule outan abscess given the stranding seen on prior CT at SH , however ,the patient was too large for the CT table at the Oale Hospital , as wellas for an MRI table , it will have to be assessed as to whether thepatient may be transferred to another facility for abdominalimaging to rule out abscess , until that time wet-to-dry dressingswill continue to the wound and antibiotics will be continued IV.Endocrine: The patient was given a regimen of NPH 14 units b.i.d.and an insulin sliding scale with excellent control of blood sugar.FEN: The patient has severe protein calorie malnutrition , and anutrition consult was obtained and extensive conversations werecarried out concerning whether or not to institute TPN or tubefeeds in this patient. The patient originally refused tube feedsand it was explained to her the risks and benefits of TPN , and aPICC was placed to institute TPN. However , on 6/6 the patientattempted to leave AMA and was declared incompetent to make medicaldecisions , so while TPN was instituted to help support the patientnutritionally , at some point a feeding tube including a permanentPEG will have to be reconsidered , as this is the best way to feedthe patient. Her admission albumin was 1.5 , indicative of severeprotein calorie malnutrition , and her severe malnutrition was alsothought to be the contributing , if not causative , factor to thepatient's renal failure.Renal: The patient's admission creatinine was 1.2 with an increaseto 1.9 overnight , and continued to rise to a level of 3 throughouther admission. A renal consult was obtained. FENA was less than 1percent , so renal felt that the patient's acute renal failure wasmost likely prerenal secondary to the patient's severe proteincalorie malnutrition at third spacing , so it was thought that thepatient would benefit from transfusions of blood products and/oralbumin to help pull fluid intravascularly. There was some thoughtthat perhaps her renal failure could have been due AIN fromnafcillin , however , her urine eos were negative. The patient didhave polyuria from yeast but this was thought to be colonizationand not actual infection. The patient did continue to receive IVfluids throughout this hospitalization , and her electrolytes weremonitored and repleted as necessary.GI: The patient did have some diarrhea , a C. diff was sent and iscurrently negative.Psychiatry: There were severe behavior problems with the patientat AMC resulting in the necessity of maintain an elaborate carecontract with the patient that details each behavior that wasexpected of the patient. However , throughout her stay at GH ,though she was thought to have a severely regressed personalitydisorder , she was deemed competent to make medical decisions andthus left AMA from that facility. Upon arrival to Wrangwake Medical Center , she did express suicidal ideations to her niece , so apsychiatric consult was obtained. However , psychiatry felt likeher suicidal ideation was most likely indicative of a borderlinetype personality disorder , so it was not thought that she wasactively suicidal and did not require a one to one sitter.However , she did continue to have manipulative behavior and severemedical noncompliance , refusing all care including basic hygieniccare as well as wound dressings , medications , and interviews withcare providers and other medically necessary interventions. Thepatient refused multiple evaluations by psychiatry to evaluate forcompetence as the patient often did not want to listen whenattempts to explain to her her medical problems and theconsequences concerning medical decisions were attempted. Finallyon October , the patient did try to leave AMA during the night ,and on the morning of March another psychiatric evaluation wasperformed and the patient was declared incompetent by psychiatry ,and the decision was made to proceed with medically necessary caredespite the patient's unwillingness to comply , and we have begunthe pursuit of her guardianship for this patient. The patient'ssister has agreed to pursue the role as her guardian. Until thattime , the patient will be restrained physically or chemically asnecessary for medically necessary intervention. Psychiatry iscontinuing to follow.CURRENT MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: Flagyl 500 mg IV q.8. , Cefotan 1 g IVq.24. , vancomycin dose by levels ,heparin 5000 units subcu t.i.d. , NPH insulin 14 units subcu b.i.d. ,regular insulin sliding scale , Zofran 8 mg IV q.8h. p.r.n. nausea ,Paxil 10 mg p.o. q.d. , miconazole powder topically b.i.d. , Nexium40 mg p.o. q.d. , Serax 15 to 30 mg p.r.n. insomnia , Ambien 5 mgp.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , and total parenteral nutrition.ENTERED BY: COY JOAQUIN GANDY , M.D. KB96Attending: LEONEL TEEM , M.D. FU89PZ027/746743Batch: 13052 Index No. F2MHLD57J5 D: 10/5/03T: 10/5/03

An admission chestx-ray demonstrated an opacity at the left base. An EKG showedsome left-sided strain unchanged from prior. She receivedazithromycin and ceftriaxone in the Emergency Department as wellas vancomycin and was started on BiPAP and transferred to theMICU. In the MICU , she was treated as a COPD flare withsteroids , antibiotics , and nebulizers , however , the patient beganto tire and developed worsening hypercarbic respiratory failureso was intubated on the night of the admission and extubated fivedays later. Over the course of her MICU admission , she developedAFib and had a troponin leak. Otherwise , the stay wasunremarkable and she extubated without complication andtransferred to the GMS Services on 4/8/06.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: End-stage renal disease on hemodialysisMonday , Wednesday and Friday. The renal failure is secondary torenal artery stenosis. Hemodialysis began in April 2005.Diabetes type 2 with hemoglobin A1c of 5.8. COPD , no PFTs areavailable. Hypertension.

Lives with her daughter , has9 children.PHYSICAL EXAM UPON TRANSFER TO THE GMS SERVICE: Weight 92.9 ,temperature is 96.2 , heart rate 118 AFib , BP 107/57 , sating 95%on 2 L. In general , she appeared younger than stated age. Shehad a psoriatic rash on her right thigh. Neuro exam , she washard of hearing , otherwise her cranial nerves were intact and shewas alert and oriented x3. Head and neck exam notable for JVP of5 cm of water. Mucous membranes were moist. Her oropharynx wasclear. Her extraocular motions were full. Her cardiac exam , shehad a regular rhythm without appreciable murmurs , rubs orgallops , no heaves. Lungs , she had expiratory wheezing withoutrhonchi or crackles. Abdomen , although distended but soft , nolaparotomy scar , normoactive bowel sounds without guarding. Shehad a Port-A-Cath in her right chest that appeared clean , dry andintact. Extremities , she had TEDs and SCDs , bilateral pedaledema , they were warm.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. From a Pulmonary Standpoint: Pneumonia/COPD flare. The patient wasadmitted with pneumonia and COPD flare for which she needed to be intubated andhad a short MICU stay. She did well on antibiotics and waschanged from ceftriaxone , azithromycin , and vancomycin tolevofloxacin which she completed a ten-day course. She alsostarted on steroid taper and will leave with 20 mg of prednisonefor two more days and then 10 mg of prednisone for three days.Upon transfer to the floor , she was restarted on Combivent andFlovent and received p.r.n. albuterol nebulizers and albuterolinhaler on a q.4 basis. Smoking cessation was emphasized withthe patient. Ace consult was called and the nicotine patch wascontinued. She was given a flu vaccine while in the hospital.The blood cultures and sputum cultures were unrevealing and herO2 saturation was titrated to greater than 93%.2. From an endocrine perspective she had a history of diabetestype 2. She was fleetingly placed on Portland protocol while inMICU and then transferred to NPH 15 b.i.d. insulin and NovoLogsliding scale. She should continue her aspirin and ACE inhibitoras an outpatient and later her hemoglobin A1c was consistent withvery well controlled diabetic.3. From a cardiovascular standpoint:A. Ischemia. Her troponin peaked to 0.38 on 11/22/06 while inthe MICU. It was not associated with any dynamic EKG changes ,however , her EKG does show some evidence of strain versusinfralateral ischemia with T-waves inversions in the inferior andlateral leads. Her troponin trended down over the course of theadmission and on last check were less than 0.2. There was aquestion of whether this leak was due to volume overload versusinfection. Her aspirin , statin , beta-blocker , and ACE werecontinued. Her fasting lipid profile was remarkable only forhypertriglyceridemia and HDL of 38. She is scheduled for aoutpatient nuclear medicine stress test on 8/13/06 at 09:00 a.m.B. Rate. She was noted to be in AFib on the MICU and rate wascontrolled with diltiazem and Lopressor titrated to heart rate of80 , she was monitored on tele over the course of admission. Shewas already in Coumadin for TIAs , however , the new INR goal forher is between 2 and 3 and Coumadin levels should be checked atthe time of dialysis.C. Pump. Her EF was 55% on echo that was done while in theMICU. There is some evidence of aortic sclerosis , otherwise ,there is no hypokinesis or wall motion abnormalities noted.4. From a hematologic standpoint , she was started on epopoietinfor anemia of chronic disease. Her baseline hematocrit of 35dropped to 26 while in the MICU and she received a unit of bloodfor that. Following that transfusion , her hematocrit was stablein the lower to mid 30s. She was also restarted on iron , whichshe takes as an outpatient. Her stool is guaiac negative overthe course of the admission.5. From a GI perspective , the patient had a mild transaminitisnoted while in the MICU thought likely secondary to hepaticcongestion. Viral serologies were drawn including hep B and C ,which were negative. Her transaminitis resolved on its own.6. From a dermatologic perspective , the patient has a history ofpsoriasis. She was continued on topical steroids with goodeffect.7. From an infectious disease standpoint , this patient hasevidence of pneumonia by clinical exam and chest x-ray onadmisison , which appeared to be resolved. She completed aten-day course of levofloxacin. In addition , multiple cultureswere taken while in the MICU including that from the A line whichgrew out coag-negative staph thought likely to be a contaminate.8. Neuro exam , she was alert and oriented and intact upontransfer to the medical service. For history of TIAs herCoumadin was continued.9. FEN. The patient was started on a renal diabetic low-fatdiet and was fluid restricted to 2 L a day.10. Renal. The patient is on dialysis Monday , Wednesday , andFriday for end-stage renal disease secondary to RAS. She isfollowed by renal and had a renal attending during the course ofthis hospitalization. She was started on Neutra-Phos ,Nephrocaps , and her PhosLo was continued. Her calcium andphosphorus were monitored q.a.m. and her IPTH was checked and was415.11. Prophylaxis.

Shepresented in this manner to her ECMHMC Clinic on the date ofadmission , and was sent immediately for an abdominal CT , whichwas noted to have findings consistent with pancreatitis. At thattime , she was transferred to the Dama Medical Centeremergency department. The patient reports that the pain began inher upper abdomen three days prior to admission with radiationthroughout the entire abdomen. She was eating soup when shefirst noted the acute onset of this pain and then had an episodeof emesis. Since then , she has not been feeling well , and notbeen eating much , but did not have any further episodes ofemesis. She did have chills overnight , but no sweats or nofevers and no diarrhea. Her last bowel movement was three daysprior to admission. The pain was more cramping and burning thansharp pain. She had never had prior episode like this. She is arare drinker , mostly on holidays. Has not had any recent viralillnesses , although did have a recent flu shot. Did not have anysick contact. In the Mano Community Hospital emergencydepartment , she received 1 liter of normal saline through her IV ,2 mg of morphine IV , and potassium replacement.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She also endorsed a small amount of anintentional weight loss and denied any chest pain , shortness ofbreath , cough , or symptoms suggestive of fluid overload.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Hypertension.2. Legal blindness , likely secondary to macular degeneration.3. Obesity.4. Osteoarthritis.5. Status post total hip replacement.6. Peripheral neuropathy.7. Status post TAHBSO for fibroids.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:1. Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily.2. Premarin 0.9 mg p.o. daily.3. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily.ALLERGIES: Lisinopril causes angioedema.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone and is retired , butpreviously worked for an epilepsy foundation. She has neversmoked tobacco. Does occasionally drink alcohol and has neverused any illicit drugs.FAMILY HISTORY: She does have a sister with a history of adropped foot , but does not have any family history of diabetes ,coronary artery disease , cancer , or pancreatitis.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: The temperature was 100.3 ,heart rate 95-110 , blood pressure 124-151/60-77 , respiratory rateof 18 , oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. In general , she wascomfortable and in no acute distress. HEENT , she has chronicinjection on the left conjunctiva , but her oropharynx was clear.Pupils were equal , round , and reactive , and extraocular movementswere intact. Her neck showed no thyromegaly , no lymphadenopathy ,and her JVP was flat. Chest with slight bibasilar crackles.Heart with a regular rate and rhythm , and a 2/6 systolic murmurat the right upper sternal border without radiation. Abdomen wassoft with decreased bowel sounds throughout and diffuse moderatetenderness to palpation without rebound , guarding , or Murphy.Extremities showed trace bilateral pitting edema to the mid shinthat were warm and well perfused with 2+ pulses. Skin showed norashes. Neuro exam was alert and oriented x3 and was grosslynonfocal.LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION: Significant for chem-7 withpotassium of 2.7 , bicarbonate of 29 with a normal creatinine of0.7. CBC showed a white blood cell count of 11.7 with 74%neutrophils , hematocrit of 36.2 , increased from a baseline of 32 ,platelets of 326 , and MCV was 85. LFTs were slightly elevatedwith an AST of 69 , ALT of 92 , alkaline phosphatase of 148 , atotal bilirubin of 1.1. Amylase was 133 , lipase was 86 , albuminwas 3.7 , and a urinalysis showed 2+ ketones , a specific gravityof 1.112 , no white blood cells , and 2+ squamous epithelial cells.IMAGING: An EKG showed no change from her prior diffuse T-waveflattening and T-wave inversion with normal sinus rhythm at 96beats per minute. Chest x-ray showed tiny bilateral pleuraleffusion and a slightly globular heart that was otherwise normal.An abdominal CT was consistent with pancreatitis withperipancreatic stranding , and there was stones seen in thegallbladder; however , there was no common bile duct dilatationand no pseudocyst or evidence of necrosis in the pancreas.ASSESSMENT: This is a 70-year-old woman with a history ofhypertension who presented with acute abdominal pain and anabdominal CT consistent with pancreatitis with gallstones in thegallbladder , but without evidence of obstruction.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. GI: Pancreatitis diagnosed by clinical picture. Laboratoryvalues on CT findings on admission with no evidence of pseudocystor necrosis or other surgical complications of pancreatitis.Though likely etiology for pancreatitis was gallstone given thatthere were gallstones seen on her abdominal CT and that she hadelevation of some of her LFTs. She did go on to have a rightupper quadrant ultrasound to reevaluate. The common bile ductlooked not dilated , but right at the upper limits of normal.Given this borderline values she was also sent for MRCP to ruleout CBD dilatation in the event that she may need cholecystectomyin the future. The MRCP showed again no evidence of obstructionof the duct and no evidence of cholecystitis. She was treatedwith aggressive IV fluid hydration for the first several days ofadmission. Pain controlled with morphine , and was kept n.p.o.for several days until her pain improved. At this time , her IVfluids were gradually decreased , and her diet was graduallyadvanced as tolerated. By the time of discharge , she wastolerating a regular diet without any recurrence of her abdominalpain , nausea , or vomiting , and was not requiring any further painmedication. Her LFTs , amylase , and lipase normalized within afew days of treatment early in the hospitalization. She was alsomaintained on IV b.i.d. H2 blocker , and then discharged to homeon p.o. Pepcid. Given her stated history of heartburn. She wasgiven an appointment to follow up with the TH General SurgeryClinic for evaluation for likely cholecystectomy and instructedthat this would be her plan of care after discharge.2. Cardiovascular. In terms of ischemia , the patient did havesome T-wave flattening diffusely on her EKG; however , had nochest pain. This is likely related to her hypokalemia onpresentation. She did rule out for an MI with 3 sets of negativeenzymes and had no EKG changes or telemetry changes concerningfor ischemia and no bouts of chest pain throughout her admission.In terms of pump , she was aggressively fluid rehydrated , givenher dehydration on admission , and her diagnosis of pancreatitis ,but did not have any signs of fluid overload at any point duringher hospitalization , and was returned to all p.o. diet withoutneed for IV fluids prior to discharge. Her blood pressure waswell controlled originally with her home medication of Norvascand then with a change to Lopressor in order to obtain good ratecontrol as well without bouts of hypertension throughout thisadmission. In terms of rhythm , the patient did have someepisodes of likely atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrialtachycardia on telemetry early in her admission. These episodeswould last only a few seconds and resolved spontaneously and thepatient did not have symptoms from these. This was thought to belikely related to her acute illness and her hypokalemia onadmission. However , she was started on Lopressor for better ratecontrol , which was up titrated as needed with good effect. Bythe time of discharge , she had had no events on telemetry forgreater than 36 hours. She was discharged on new medication ofToprol to control her rate and also taking the place of herNorvasc for her blood pressure control.3. ID. The patient did have a low-grade temperature onadmission , but this was likely related to her inflammation.Blood cultures x2 drawn at the time of admission were negative.The chest x-ray was negative for any growth and finalized beforedischarge. Chest x-ray was negative for any evidence ofpneumonia and a urinalysis was negative. She was not started onany antibiotics throughout the admission.4. Hematology. The patient has underlying anemia with anunclear baseline hematocrit given her infrequent labs at thisinstitution. Her hematocrit was stable between 31 and 36throughout her hospitalization here and recommended that shefollows up with her primary care provider for furtherinstructions on her anemia.5. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition. The patient was initiallyaggressively fluid rehydrated and then changed to maintenance IVfluids. Thus , her diet was advanced. Potassium and magnesiumwere repeated as needed with electrolytes originally checkedtwice per day until stabilized. She was originally maintainedn.p.o. and then her diet was gradually advanced as her symptomstolerated to a house diet before discharge.6. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on IV b.i.d. , Pepcidfor GI prophylaxis , and Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.7. Code status. The patient is DNR/DNI.DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient is discharged to home with avisiting nurse to check in on her for medication management ,nutrition , and home safety evaluation. She has followupappointments with her primary care provider , Dr. Gahring , andalso with the FNH General Surgery Clinic regarding possiblecholecystectomy. She was instructed not to take her Norvasc anymore and to take instead the Toprol. Also , she was instructed tocall her physician for any new bouts of abdominal pain , fevers ,or any other worrisome symptoms.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Toprol-XL 100 mg per day.2. Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.3. Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily.4. Premarin 0.9 mg p.o. daily ( however , it is recommended thather PCP consider weaning off this medication given its knownrisks and recent evidence-based literature , and also given thepossible risk of gallstones of this medication ).eScription document: 9-3466454 NFFocusDictated By: PASCUCCI , JOHNIEAttending: ROHDENBURG , LEONARDO OLIVERDictation ID 9310255D: 8/7/06T: 2/18/06

Upon catherization , two occlusions were noted inthe PLV: a 90% occlusion , as well as a moderate sized plaque.Revascularization was achieved with the placement of non-drug alludingstents to these lesions; the original 90% lesion was stented to 0%occlusion. During the catheterization , Dr. Taran noted a gradient of40mmHg from the thoracic aorta to the femoral aorta raising thepossibility of this as an etiology for Mr. Mcconnell 's severe lower back painand limited ability to ambulate. The catheterization was withoutcomplications. The patient was placed on Plavix x 6 weeks and Aspirinindefinately following the procedure , and continued on his home regimenof Captopril , Metoprolol , Isordil , Digoxin , Spironalactone , Insulin ,Lasix , Zocor and prn Nitroglycerin.

Prior to admissionshe lived with her husband and was independent with activities ofdaily living. She was limited by right knee pain. She wasadmitted to Roundcleod Valley Medical Center 9/2/05 for electiveright total knee replacement.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Migraine headaches , interstitial lungdisease , asthma , reflux , hepatitis A , autoimmune hepatitisleading to cirrhosis with varices , hypersplenism , andthrombocytopenia , coagulopathy , chronic diarrhea x10 years ,status post cholecystectomy , osteoporosis , L4 compressionfracture , osteoarthritis.HOME MEDICATIONS:1. Valium.2. Advair.3. Combivent.4. Prednisone5. Nexium.6. Propranolol.7. Lasix.8. Spironolactone.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drinkalcohol. She is married with four children.ADMISSION LABS: Potassium 4.3 , white blood cell count 9.9 ,hematocrit 26.3 , platelets 61 , INR 1.3.ADMISSION EXAM: First documented by the orthopedic team: Alertand oriented , afebrile. Pulse in the 70s and sinus. Bloodpressure in the 90s/50s. Satting 100% on 2 liters. Thin ,elderly woman , faint bibasilar crackles. Regular rate andrhythm. Abdomen: Soft and nontender. Extremities: Warm.ADMISSION IMAGING: Portable chest x-ray on 10/11/05 with patchyopacity in the left lung base , likely atelectasis.ADMISSION EKG: Normal sinus rhythm , normal axis. QTC 464. LVH ,T-wave inversion in 3 , T-wave flattening in AVF , T-waveflattening in V3 through V6.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Ortho: Right knee replacement. The patient underwent anuncomplicated right knee replacement on admission. Subsequentlyher leg was immobilized as per orthopedic recommendations. Thereason for immobilization was that movement of the right lowerextremity might precipitate skin tears.2. Skin: The patient incurred a laceration in her left calfperioperatively. She also incurred a skin tear on 11/29/05 withturning in the bed. Her skin was noted to be paper thin withunderlying fluid. Wound healing was impaired secondary to lowalbumin and chronic steroid use. The patient was seen by thePlastic Surgery team. This team recommended appropriatedressings for the patient's skin tears. The team also graftedthe left thigh skin tear. The patient was treated withsupplemental vitamins to promote wound healing including vitaminA and zinc. She was also treated with antibiotics to preventskin infections. Originally she had been on vancomycin for aurinary tract infection and when the course was complete for theurinary tract infection , the patient was switched to Keflex forprophylaxis versus skin infections.3. GI: End stage liver disease with varices andthrombocytopenia. The patient's complete metabolic panel andcoags were checked each day. During the course of herhospitalization , the patient's transaminases were relativelystable , but her alkaline phosphatase trended upward. On exam ,the patient had mild right upper quadrant tenderness which shereported was chronic. On 5/13/05 , the patient underwent anabdominal ultrasound to evaluate her right upper quadranttenderness and elevated alk/phos. This study revealed a 2.0 x1.6 x 1.6 cm hyperechoic mass in the portahepatis. This studyalso showed evidence of cirrhosis as well as common bile ductdilation and splenomegaly. A CT scan to further evaluate theportahepatic mass was recommended. For her autoimmune hepatitis ,the patient was continued on prednisone. For her varices , shewas continued on propranolol. Her Lasix and spironolactone wereheld through much of her hospitalization. On 6/19/05 , her Lasixwas restarted in an attempt to remedy her hyponatremia.4. Low albumin state: The patient has a low prealbuminsuggestive of decreased PO intake versus decreased syntheticfunction of the liver. The patient also has chronic diarrhea andwas thought to be wasting protein. The patient refused ??___??placement for tube feeds. She was initially on a house diet withEnsure and Boost supplements as well as MVI and lactinexgranules. The patient was not taking in adequate calories. On6/19/05 , TPN was initiated.5. Persistent chronic diarrhea: The patient has a history ofchronic diarrhea. Stool studies including C. diff testing wasnegative. The patient was also tested for celiac sprue and thistesting , too , came back negative. The patient was treatedsymptomatically with Imodium.6. GERD: This patient was treated with Nexium and p.r.n.Maalox.7. Dysphagia: The patient reported trouble swallowing. She wasevaluated by the Speech and Swallow team on 4/6/05. Herswallowing function was noted to be intact.8. Infectious Disease:Postoperative prophylaxis: Immediately postoperatively , thepatient was initially treated with clindamycin for prophylaxisversus perioperative infection.Skin Prophylaxis: The patient was initially treated withvancomycin and switched to Keflex.Urinary tract infection: The patient had a series of dirty UA's.She was ultimately treated with vancomycin for a urine culturethat grew out resistant staph species. She finished her courseof vancomycin on 8/7/05. A repeat UA was noted to be positivefor infection. A repeat urine culture is pending.Odynophagia: The patient reported trouble swallowing. She wastreated empirically with fluconazole and clotrimazole foresophageal Candida. This treatment did not remedy her pain inswallowing. The patient then developed mouth sores. HSV swabsof these sores are pending. The patient was treatedsymptomatically with viscous lidocaine.9. Pulmonary: The patient has a history of interstitial lungdisease and asthma. She was treated with Combivent and standingnebulizer treatments. On 8/6/05 , the patient was noted to havea new oxygen requirement of 3 to 4 liters. Differentialdiagnosis was PE versus pneumonia versus volume overload. On8/6/05 , the patient had a chest x-ray which showed left lowerlobe atelectasis. A repeat chest x-ray on 10/17/05 was read asnormal. On 7/15/05 , the patient was weaned down to room air.10. Neuro:Pain: The patient was treated with standing codeine sulfate.Nausea: The patient was treated with p.r.n. Compazine.11. Cardiovascular:Pump: The patient has no known heart failure. In terms of hervolume status , she was deemed to be intravascularly depleted asevidenced by prerenal urine electrolytes. She was thought ,however , to be total body volume overloaded. It was thought thatin the setting of her low albumin , she was third-spacing fluid.The patient was intermittently treated with normal saline andspa. On 6/19/05 , normal saline was held and the patient wastreated with spa in conjunction with Lasix.Rhythm: The patient had normal sinus rhythm. She was monitoredon telemetry.Ischemia: The patient has no known history of coronary arterydisease. She had no chest pain. Her cardiac markers werenegative. Her EKG had nonspecific abnormalities. She wascontinued on her beta-blocker. She was not on an aspirin givenher thrombocytopenia.12. Renal: Decreased urine output. From the day of admissiononward , the patient had relative oliguria , 500 to 900 cc of urineper day approximately. Her creatinine trended downward from avalue of 0.5 on admission down to as low as 0.2. As noted above ,the patient was intermittently treated with normal saline and spaversus spa and Lasix.13. Hyponatremia: The patient developed asymptomatichyponatremia. This hyponatremia was not responsive to fluidrestriction. On 6/19/05 , the patient was treated with Lasix andspa as noted above. TSH , cortisol and uric acid were checked torule out other etiologies of hyponatremia. The results of thesestudies are pending.14. Endocrine: The patient has steroid induced diabetes. She wastreated with Lantus and sliding scale insulin.15. Heme: Anemia: The patient had normal iron studies , B12 andfolate.16. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is mostlikely secondary to splenic sequestration. An antiplateletfactor 4 test was sent and is pending.17. Anticoagulation: The patient had two indications foranticoagulation. The first was right total knee replacement.The second was a right lower extremity superficial femoral DVTdiscovered on 10/16/05. The goal INR for this patient wasdetermined to be 1.5 to 2. It was thought that the patient wasat bleeding risk with a higher INR given her known varices andher thrombocytopenia. From 8/21/05 onward , the patient's INR wassupertherapeutic and her Coumadin was held. It was thought thatthe supertherapeutic INR could relate to Coumadin effects versusnutritional deficiencies versus worsening of her function.18. Musculoskeletal: Osteoporosis: The patient was treated withcholecalciferol.19. Physical therapy: The patient was followed by the PhysicalTherapy team.20. Access: The patient had a PIC line in place.Discharge medications , the remainder of the hospital course anddisposition will be dictated by Dr. Steven JaksiceScription document: 2-9937431 OCAENTERED BY: HEPA , SETHAttending: DEGRELLA , HERSHEL GARRYDictation ID 1965140D: 4/10/05T: 4/10/05

In October 1992 she presented in atrialfibrillation which was well controlled on Quinidine. The Quinidinewas discontinued the following year in April when the patient had asyncopal episode. At that time , she ruled out for myocardialinfarction and failed Sotalol with increasing PR and QT intervals.Holter study was negative at that time. Persantine scan showed noST changes noted and a fixed defect was present. The patient wasdischarged on Lopressor. On August , 1993 she was admitted withright ankle pain , right lower extremity swelling. Lineis werenegative at that time. On 10/5/93 she was admitted in atrialflutter with II:I conduction. Trial of procainamide was complicatedby increasing QT intervals. The Procainimide was thereforediscontinued and the Propafenone was begun. The patient underwentsuccessful DC cardioversion and was discharged on Propafenone 225t.i.d. and Lasix 80 q day. Since the morning before admission shefelt light-headed and sweaty. She began to run out of Propafenonetwo days before admission and decreased the dose to 150 mg threetimes a day. She felt her heart was going slower than normal.

Her blood pressure is 134/80 without orthostatic change.Her mouth appears dry but is otherwise unremarkable.Cardiovascular examination notes a regular rate and rhythm with aprominent mid-systolic prosthetic valve click. There werebilateral crackles at the bases. The abdominal and rectalexaminations are normal , stool is guaiac negative. Extremitiesshowed pigmentation changes in bilateral lower extremities withwell preserved pulses except the dorsalis pedis pulses which areweak. Neurological examination is unremarkable.LABORATORY DATA: On admission , EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at78 beats per minute , axis 145 degrees , PR intervalof 132 milliseconds , no significant change from previous EKG fromFebruary 1993.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , placed on cardiacmonitor and Holter monitor. On the morningfollowing admission she was clearly in atrial flutter with II:Iconduction block as confirmed by the Holter monitor. Herprothrombin time was 25.2 , therefore , on the second hospital day ,she underwent successful DC cardioversion with 52 joules. Theprocedure was carried out without complications; afterwards , thepatient was in normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block and aPR interval of 300-320 milliseconds. The patient was observedthrough the next day , remained in normal sinus rhythm except forshort periods of SVT with sinus pause. She was asymptomatic and wasable to exercise around the hospital floor and up and down thestairs. Anticoagulation. The patient is maintained on chronicCoumadin anticoagulation and at the time of admission she wascontinued on her outpatient maintenance of 7.5 mg q hs. However ,over the first hospital day prothrombin time increased from 22.3 onadmission to 28.6. Therefore , her Coumadin was held. Theprothrombin time was 29.1. The prothrombin time on discharge was32 , INR of 3.3 and the patient was instructed to continue on 5 mgof Coumadin q hs and to see Dr. Dry in the clinic for PT check inthe next week.DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: Propafenone 225 mg p.o t.i.d.; Colace100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q.o.d.until May , 1993; Lasix 80 mg p.o. q d; Plaquenil 200 mg p.o.b.i.d.; NPH Insulin 10 mg subcu q a.m.; Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q h.s.;Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q d; Slo-K 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.

Patient had a history of variegate porphyriafor about fifteen years , was followed by Dr. Nigel Wickenhauser , and shehad been relatively free of porphyria attacks with the last majorone approximately twelve years ago with symptoms similar to thoseshe was experiencing at the time of this admission. In April1994 , she had a mild porphyria attack which was managed by stopping allher medications. She intermittently had skin lesions ,especially with sun exposure. She had never been phlebotomized orreceived other treatments. In the past two months , she had beentaking Ativan of 3-4 mg q.d. for anxiety. She stopped takingAtivan on January , 1995 and after this abrupt stopping of thismedication , she started to have feelings of disorientation ,confusion , and fatigue with emotional lability. She also was inIdaho with extensive sun exposure in the last two weeks. Shecontacted Dr. Furuya who advised her to increase her carbohydrateintake to about 400 grams a day , however , her symptoms progressed.Two days prior to admission , she felt weak and while standing , herlegs gave way without losing consciousness. She felt weakthroughout the week before admission with no vertigo , tinnitus , orataxia. She also felt paresthesias of the hands and feet but notperioral and she also experienced episodes of flushing andtremulousness with a feeling of rushing sensation in the chest withno tachycardia associated at the time of this symptomatology. Shehad no fevers with the sensation of flushing and feeling of burningup. She had several bouts of diarrhea intermingled withconstipation. On the day of admission , patient became confused anddisoriented while driving and she came to see Dr. Heyn in theVVH Clinic. She was admitted for evaluation of a possibleporphyria attack. Of note , the only new medications that she hadbeen taking was chloral hydrate for the last five days andCompazine with one dose.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Insulin dependent diabetes. 2 )Coronary artery disease status post PTCAtimes two and a coronary artery bypass graft of the left anteriordescending in 6/25 Exercise tolerance test was noted beforecatheterization and she had a catheterization in 1/10 for angina.She had a patent LIMA graft , 60% proximal left anterior descendinglesion , and 50% right coronary artery stenosis. 3 )Hypercholesterolemia , did not tolerate cholestyramine. 4 ) Statuspost left ulna entrapment release two months ago. 5 )Hypertension. 6 ) Status post excisional biopsy of the left breast; thepathology of the lesion was diabetic mastopathy.ALLERGIES: Morphine which gave her a rash and patient avoidedmultiple medications which were known to worsenporphyria such as sulfa drugs ( not allgergies )CURRENT MEDICATIONS: At home , patient took insulin NPH 25 units inthe morning with Regular 10 units in themorning , aspirin 81 mg q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Compazine 5 mgq.6h. p.r.n. anxiety of which she took only one dose , and chloralhydrate 500 to 1000 mg q.h.s. for five days.SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient was married for fifteen years with oneson and no history of smoking or ethanol use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was a pale and anxious white femalein no apparent distress with a temperatureof 99.5 , blood pressure 134/70 , heart rate of 92 , respiratory rateof 18 , and O2 saturation of 97% on room air. HEENT: Examinationwas significant for oropharynx with upper dentures and sclerae wereanicteric. NECK: Supple with no jugular venous distention , nolymphadenopathy , and thyroid was not palpable. CHEST: Clear toauscultation bilaterally with no costovertebral angle tenderness.BREASTS: Examination was notable for fully healed scar of the leftbreast. CARDIOVASCULAR: Examination showed a regular rate andrhythm , normal S1 and S2 , and 2/6 systolic murmur heard best atthe apex. ABDOMEN: Soft with good bowel sounds , non-tender , andnon-distended. EXTREMITIES: 1+ pedal pulses bilaterally and noclubbing , cyanosis , or edema. SKIN: Examination showed a blisterof the left hand fourth and fifth digit interspace and healedlesions on the right hand. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination showed herto be alert and oriented times three with a normal mental statusexamination with no confusion noted. Cranial nerves were intact ,motor was symmetric of 3-4/5 on all muscle groups , sensoryexamination was significant for decrease to light touch in thedistal feet and hands , deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and 1-2+throughout , and coordination showed rapid alternating movements andfinger-to-nose both within normal limits. Gait was mildly widebased with normal heel-to-toe walk , she had no pronator drift , andRomberg was positive.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was significant for a BUN of17 , creatinine of 1.0 , glucose was 364 ,liver function tests were within normal limits , white count was7.2 , hematocrit was 36 , and platelet count was 266.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for possible porphyriaattack versus Ativan withdrawal symptoms versusanxiety attack. Neurology consultation was obtained who felt thatpatient's peripheral neuropathy was probably secondary tolongstanding diabetes but felt that some of her symptomatologycould be consistent with porphyria. Patient was also seen byPsychiatry who felt that this episode was consistent withgeneralized anxiety disorder separated by post dysthymia andsuggested phenothiazines which are proven to be safe in porphyriafor treatment. She was started on Trilafon 2 to 4 mg p.o. p.r.n.q.6h. for anxiety. The patient was also seen to be orthostaticwhich was felt to be secondary to dehydration secondary to poorp.o. intake prior to admission. She was also hyperglycemic onadmission which may have contributed to her dehydration. She wastreated with normal saline boluses and her orthostasis improved.Her Lopressor was also held with this episode of orthostasis. TheWatson-Schwartz test done by Dr. Mohar on patient very early in the admissionwas negative which made an acute porphyria attack veryunlikely. These episodes were felt to be secondary to acombination of anxiety attack and rapid taper of Ativan which shehad been taking at moderately high doses for the last two months.Patient also developed urinary tract infection symptoms and herurine culture showed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of E. coli whichwere pansensitive. She was started on Keflex 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.which is shown to be safe in porphyria.DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged to home on July in goodcondition.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , insulin NPH 25units subcutaneously q.a.m. , insulinregular 10 units subcutaneously q.a.m. , Trilafon 2 mg p.o. q.6h. ,and Keflex 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up will be with Dr. Dario RodriquzDictated By: BERNARD SYPOLT , M.D. AD9Attending: JASPER E.

In general , the patient appeared comfortable withpleasant and convulsant and blind. Neck showed a JVP of 7.Chest exam was with left basilar crackles no wheezes. Heart wasregular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur atthe left upper sternal border. Abdomen was soft , nontender , andnondistended with normal bowel sounds. Extremities with noclubbing , cyanosis , or edema.LABORATORY DATA: On admission were significant for potassium of4.5 , BUN of 23 , creatinine 1.6 , which is at her baseline of 1.4to 1.6. White blood cell count of 5.7 , hematocrit 27.3 from abaseline of 26 to 29 , platelets of 347 , 000. Coagulation studieswere normal. Liver function tests were normal. Cardiac enzymeswere negative. Chest x-ray showed no change in the left lowerlobe infiltrate , since 10/20/06. An EKG showed Q-waveflattening , but no changes from her prior EKGs. Normal sinusrhythm.IMPRESSION: This is an 86-year-old woman with multiple medicalproblems including congestive heart failure , diabetes , andadrenal insufficiency , who presents with recurrent fevers throughlevofloxacin and vancomycin.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Infectious Disease. Initially , the source of her repeatedfevers was unclear. Multiple cultures were sent including urinecultures , stool studies , peripheral blood cultures and bloodcultures from the PICC sputum cultures and induced sputum withtesting for PCP , given her history of chronic steroid useswithout PCP prophylaxis. All of these came back negative withthe exception of one blood culture from the PICC , which grewcoagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus. So , the PICC line wasdiscontinued and the tip sent for culture , which was negative.After discontinuation of the PICC line , the patient did not haveany further fevers. The remainder of her admission , which wasgreater than 72 hours. The induced sputum for PCP was alsonegative and the patient was then started on PCP prophylaxis withMepron ( given her sulfa allergy ) to be continued until she hadcompleted her gradual tapper off of steroids. She completed thelevofloxacin and vancomycin courses , which were started on theprevious admission , for pneumonia and did not have any furtherfevers after completing these antibiotics. A PPD was placed ,which was negative.2. Endocrine. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism ,adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroids in the pastand insulin-dependent diabetes. Her TSH was checked and wasnormal on admission. So , she was continued on her home dose ofSynthroid. Further instructions through her primary careprovider. Her hydrocortisone was slightly decreased and her slowtaper will be further directed by her primary care provider afterdischarge. Her insulin regimen was up titrated with the additionof the q.a.c. Novalog , given her high fingerstick blood glucoses.She should continue on this increased regimen after discharge.3. Pulmonary. On admission , the patient was noted to be hypoxicon room air with an oxygen saturation of 79% to 80% , whichincreased to 93% on 2 L to 3 L of nasal cannula. Given this newhypoxia and her chronic decreased ambulation , she was sent for aCT angiogram of the chest , which was negative for PE. The studyalso shows small bilateral pleural effusion and mild pulmonaryedema. Resolution of her previous pneumonia and possiblyreactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Given this data , she wasrestarted on Lasix with diuresis , titrated to 1 L negative perday and was sound well. Given this data , she was restarted onLasix with the diuresis titrated to 1 L negative per day andresponded well. She had decreasing shortness of breath andimproved room air oxygen saturation up to 85% at the time ofdischarge. She is continued to be maintained on oxygen of 2 Lnasal cannula with good oxygen saturation and is anticipated tohave a successful gradual wean from oxygen as her diuresiscontinue after discharge. The Pulmonary Service was consultedand followed her agreeing with the diagnosis of pulmonary edema.They also recommended a followup noncontrast chest CT in 2 to 4weeks after discharge to reevaluate her mediastinallymphadenopathy after a period of diuresis. A followupappointment was made with Dr. Soucek at the Chest Clinic atSio Sane Hospital for two weeks following discharge.Pulmonary function test were completed , which showed arestrictive defect , which the Pulmonary Service felt could beattributed to her volume overload. An echo showed an increasedpulmonary artery systolic pressure at 47 plus the right atrialpressure consistent with previous echo done in September of 2005.Thus , this was not considered to be new pathology , nor likelyrelated to her new hypoxia.4. Hematologic. The patient has a known diagnosis of irondeficiency anemia as well as anemia of chronic disease and ismaintaining on iron and epoetin as an outpatient. There were nosigns or symptoms of bleeding throughout this admission and shenot required a blood transfusion at any point. She shouldcontinue on her outpatient regimen of iron and epoetin afterdischarge. Iron studies done on this admission showed adequateiron repletion with her current regimen.5. Cardiovascular. There was no evidence of ischemia throughoutthe admission. Given her findings of pulmonary edema on chest CTand her history of diastolic congestive heart failure , she wasstarted on Lasix 20 mg IV b.i.d. with effective diuresis noted.This was transitioned to a p.o. regimen of 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,which will be continued after discharge and titrated to herweight loss. She was also continued on her outpatient Zocor ,Norvasc and lisinopril.6. Renal. The patient has a history of chronic renalinsufficiency. She received Mucomyst and bicarbonate in her IVfluids , prior to her CT angiogram of the chest with prophylaxisagainst contrast nephropathy. Her creatinine remained stable at1.6 for remainder of the admission , which was greater than 72hours. All mediations were appropriately renally dosed. Sheshould continue followup with her primary care provider regardingher chronic renal insufficiency in the future.7. Fluid , Electrolytes , and Nutrition. The patient wasmaintained on any IV fluids except as prophylaxis for her CTangiogram. The potassium and magnesium were repeated as neededand she was maintained on the renal , cardiac ADA diet.8. Prophylaxis: She was maintained on t.i.d. subq heparin forDVT prophylaxis and Nexium for GI prophylaxis as well as anaggressive bowel regimen , given her history of chronicconstipation.9. Code Status: The patient is DNR/DNI and her son John Durazo , is the healthcare proxy.DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will be discharged back to Mclemens Hospital Of County to continue physical therapy to regain some independencewith her activities of daily living and more specifically toregain some independence and the activities , which she enjoyssuch as playing the piano. She will have followup with herprimary care provider , Dr. Pacetti regarding general plan for hercare including gradual hydrocortisone taper , her Lasix dosing andher diabetes management. She will also followup at the chestclinic with Dr. Tobola regarding her PCP prophylaxis and thepossibly of repeat chest CT regarding the question of hermediastinal lymphadenopathy seen on CT during this admission.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:1.

Thepatient lives with her husband in a retirementhome. Tobacco - One pack per day for 20 years. Quit 20 years ago.Alcohol - Occasional.FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother had a stroke in her 60's.LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies on admission showed a whiteblood cell count of 8 , 200 , with 15 bands. ALT18 , AST 26 , alkaline phosphatase 64 , total bilirubin 0.2 , ESR 55 ,hematocrit 35.8. Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , creatinine 1.3.A spinal tap was done which revealed the gram stain revealed noorganisms , no polys and no epithelial cells. Only one white cellwas noted in the CSF , glucose 92 , protein 46. The patient'surinalysis showed 5 - 7 white blood cells , 2+ bacteria. Thepatient's chest x-ray showed no infiltrates , no free air. KUBshowed no signs of obstruction.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's Imuran was held because it wasthought that this could be a possible cause ofher fever. She was started on Ceftriaxone two grams , Mezlin andGentamicin in the Emergency Room. The patient's blood and urinecultures were all negative , as was the spinal culture. The patientimproved steadily , and the day following admission she had beenafebrile x 24 hours saturating 94% on room air; therefore , the planwas to discharge her. On the floor the patient received two gramsof Ceftazidime x one and then was taken off of antibiotics.On the afternoon of 29 of July the patient's oxygen saturationsuddenly dropped. She complained of feeling short of breath andnauseous. Her room air saturation was 82% when these symptomsfirst developed. Over the next 30 minutes the patientdecompensated and her oxygenation was steadily increased; however ,on 100% nonrebreather face mask her oxygen saturation was less than80% and her skin appeared mottled. A portable chest x-ray showedmild congestive heart failure. The patient's EKG showed a normalsinus rhythm , no axis changes and no ST changes. The patient hadreceived 100 mg of IV Compazine for nausea; otherwise , no newmedications since admission. Her temperature was 100.5 at 2:00p.m. Because of her rapid decompensation a code green was calledand she was intubated and transferred to the MICU. ABG showed a pHof 7.35 , a pCO2 of 44 , and a pO2 of 96 following intubation. Bloodpressure remained , during this time , at 130 to 200 over 70 to 90with heartrates in the 70's to 90's. During her rapiddecompensation the patient was given nebulizers , but with noeffect. The cause of the patient's sudden decompensation wasunclear. During the period of rapid decompensation the patient gota total of 100 mg of IV Lasix. Her lung exam showed some crackles ,but she did not appear to be all that wet. A chest x-ray threehours post intubation showed diffuse fluffy infiltrates in thebilateral lung fields , more central than peripheral. No effusionwas noted. Based on the findings of this chest x-ray , a VQ scanwas not done. It was thought that the rapid decompensation was dueto either pulmonary edema ( the patient had been on 150 cc an hourof IV fluids for approximately 24 hours because she was dehydratedwhen she first came in ) , blood , or pneumonia. The patient wascovered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime ( for Pseudomonas ) ,Levofloxacin ( for Legionella ) , and Pentamidine ( for PCP ). Thepatient was also given 50 mg of IV Solu-Medrol b.i.d. Numerouslaboratory studies were sent off including: RSV , influenza ,parainfluenza , VRE , Legionella , PCP , adenovirus , acid-fast bacilli ,CH50 , and ANA , all of which were negative. Urine and bloodcultures were negative as well. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema wasthought to be an unlikely cause , given that she had a normal leftventricular size and an ejection fraction of 50% in anechocardiogram done right after being intubated. There was also noevidence of any right ventricular dysfunction or RV strain.She did well over the two days following intubation and wasextubated on 6 of May A bronchoscopy was considered , given thepatient's history of hemoptysis , but as the hemoptysis resolvedover the next couple of days , it was thought to be unnecessary.The patient's oxygen saturation following extubation was 95% onthree liters nasal cannula and continued to be in the mid 90's onceshe was weaned to room air in the subsequent two days. Allantibiotics were stopped while the patient was in the MICU exceptfor Levofloxacin , which was continued for a seven to ten daycourse. The patient was gradually tapered off of the IVSolu-Medrol and put on a p.o. prednisone taper starting at 80 mgp.o. q day. The Pulmonary Consult Team saw her when she was backon the floor for her continued hemoptysis , but this appeared toresolve over the next couple of days , and , as a result , it wasdecided that this need not be pursued at the present. The patientdid well over the next several days and the day prior to dischargewas saturating at 94% on room air and received 10 mg of p.o.prednisone. The etiology of the patient's sudden decompensationwas never entirely clarified , but it appeared that flash pulmonaryedema was probably the most likely explanation , possibly due to aviral pneumonia in conjunction with fluid overload.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.headache. 2 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. qday. 3 ) Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4 ) Lasix 20 mg p.o. q otherday. 5 ) Glucotrol 10 mg p.o. q day. 6 ) Synthroid 125 microgramsp.o. q day. 7 ) Lithium 300 mg p.o. q day. 8 ) Cytotec 400micrograms p.o. t.i.d. 9 ) Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q day. 10 )Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. 11 ) Inderal 20 mg p.o. q day. 12 )Fosamax 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. 13 ) Elavil 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient's discharge disposition is tohome with VNA.FOLLOW-UP PLANS: The patient is to follow-up with her primarycare doctor , Dr. Valentine Hawf , if her weightincreases by more than two pounds , or if she has any furtherproblems.

She now presents with nausea and vomiting. Thepatient presents with two to three weeks of decrease p.o. intakeand diminished appetite in the past week. She has also hadnausea , vomiting , and epigastric pain after meals. Vomiting wasnonbloody and nonbilious. The patient has had a 10-pound weightloss in the past two months. She also complains of myalgias ,malaise , fatigue , dizziness , occasional shortness of breath ,dyspnea on exertion , and a nonproductive cough. She denies chestpain , palpitations , headaches , visual changes , or loss ofconsciousness. She presented to her PCP on the day prior toadmission. Routine chemistries were checked and calcium wasfound to be 14 , potassium 5.7 , and creatinine 4.6. She wastherefore sent to the Stter Hoodsress Mofoote Hospital Emergency Room. In the emergencyroom she was afebrile , her heart rate was 56 , her blood pressurewas 147/70 , and she was saturating 98% on room air. Her EKGshowed bradycardia with no ST changes and no big T waves.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Type-2 diabetes , hypertension , perihilar lung mass greater than 4cm on CT from September 2002 at Alpe Health Care at which time thepatient refused biopsy.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:Temperature 98.4 , heart rate 56 , blood pressure 147/70 , andsaturation 98% on room air. No cervical lymphadenopathy. Noneck masses. No thyromegaly. Chest with bilateral crackles2/3rd of the way up , which are per PCP are chronic.Cardiovascular , distant heart sounds , S1 , S2. No rubs , murmurs ,or gallops. JVP flat. No carotid bruits. Abdomen , soft andnondistended. Epigastrium is tender to palpation. No masses.No inguinal lymphadenopathy. No peripheral edema , clubbing , orcyanosis.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Hypercalcemia. The patient's initial calcium was 13.2 , adecrease to the mid 9 range with aggressive IV fluids. Studiessent included PTH = 26 , vitamin D = 27 , TSH = 1.69 , and PTHrPwhich is still pending at the time of discharge. The patient hada negative PPD placed three induced sputum for TB , which were allnegative. SPEP and UPEP had increased gamma globulins , but hewas polyclonal and no end spikes. A chest CT showed largemediastinal lymphadenopathy with multiple 2-3 cm nodes. Nointraparenchymal disease. A mediastinoscopy for biopsy andintraoperative BAL were done and the pathology and microbiologyare pending at the time of discharge. Abdominal CT was negative.2. Renal. Baseline creatinine is 2-3. Creatinine increased to6 on admission and was down to 3.4 with aggressive hydration bythe time of discharge. There were no casts in her urine. Herphenol was 11.6% on admission. It was thought that her acuterenal failure was secondary to prerenal azotemia as well as acomponent of ATN and tubular damage from the hypercalcemia. Hercreatinine remains stable around 3.4 on discharge.3. Pulmonary. She did not have any pulmonary symptoms exceptfor a mild cough that had resolved on admission. She did havepersistent bibasilar crackles , which were old per her PCP. Shehad no shortness of breath and her saturations remain greaterthan 96% on room air throughout admission. Her chest x-rayshowed no evidence of infiltrates , but did show right mediastinalwidening and calcific nodularity in the right upper lobes. ChestCT showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy as described above and alsoa small area of tree-in-bud inflammation. She was ruled out forTB with induced sputum x 3. Mediastinoscopy biopsy on 1/5/04 ,results are pending.4. Heme. Anemia workup. Iron 49 , TIBC 256 , B12 555 , folatenormal , ferritin 102 , reticulocyte 7.9 , and Epogen level 19. Shehas a normocytic anemia , but given her chronic renalinsufficiency she has a mild degree of iron deficiency. Thelikely etiology of her anemia is secondary to renal disease.Iron supplementation was started. Hematocrit was stablethroughout admission.5. Endocrine. The patient has a history of diabetes and washypoglycemic on admission. This resolved with hydration. HerPTH was 26 , her vitamin D was 27 , PTHrP is pending. She was kepton a regular insulin sliding scale during the admission. Sheresumed her NPH dose as an outpatient on discharge. She willneed a close follow up of blood sugars as an outpatient. Her TSHwas 1.69.6. Skin. The patient had a pruritic rash on her right back ,which appeared about a week prior to admission. She had a fewscattered 1-2 cm dark nodular regions over the mid right back.She did not have pustules or discharge from lesions. She alsohad areas of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation on her left upperback.DISPOSITION.The patient is discharged home in stable condition. She willfollow up in one week with her PCP Dr. Gensel He will need todiscontinue the stitches on her neck and follow up all theresults and arrange treatment as appropriate. Instructions weregiven to the patient in Spanish.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Cardizem SR 240 mg p.o. q.d. , metoprolol XL 75 mg q.d. , NPH athome doses , iron 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Percocet one tablet p.o.q.6h. p.r.n. pain for the few days following the mediastinoscopy.The patient is discharged in stable condition with follow up withDr. Alligood to be arranged in one week.eScription document: 6-1812063 EMSSten TelDictated By: ZEHRBACH , CRISTOPHERAttending: COULLARD , COLBYDictation ID 2094491D: 6/7/04T: 6/6/04

642413904 | DMC | 85084167 | | 621601 | 7/3/1990 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Unsigned | DIS | Admission Date: 4/16/1990 Report Status: UnsignedDischarge Date: 5/16/1990HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 22 year old , gravida V para0314 , at 24 weeks , now with severefrontal headache and scintillations. Dating is by the lastmenstrual period and an early ultrasound which placed her atapproximately 24 weeks. She presented with a three and a half dayhistory of severe frontal headaches with scintillations. There wasno relief with Tylenol , aspirin or Fioricet. She also stated shehad marked polydipsia for four days. She denied abdominal pain orswelling. She has a history of preeclampsia with a previous twingestation. She does note fetal activity. At this juncture , Ishould note that much of this history is as per patient and issomewhat unreliable. PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY: C-section fortwins; previous C-section for singleton; history by patient ofpreeclampsia. PAST HISTORY: Initially she admitted to no pastmedical problems , however , upon reviewing her chart the followingis obvious: chronic hypertension; seizure disorder following motorvehicle accident for which she is on valproic acid , no clearlydocumented recent seizures; history of asthma for which she takesmedicines p.r.n.; history of behavioral disorders with question ofpseudoseizures in the past; obesity; multiple drug allergies;cholecystectomy in 1990; appendectomy at age 14; motor vehicleaccident with V-P shunt placement in 1980; facial reconstructiontimes three in 1980; superficial vascular surgery in 1989 forvaricosities of the lower extremities. SOCIAL HISTORY: She deniestobacco , ethanol or drug use.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed an obese white female in milddistress. The pupils are equal , round andreactive to light and accommodation; fundi well visualized , nopapilledema. Good facial movements. No oral lesions. The chestwas clear. The heart showed a regular rate and rhythm. Theabdomen was soft and nontender with a fetal heart rate in the140's. The extremities showed trace edema. The neuro exam showedcranial nerves II-XII grossly intact. Reflexes were 1+ withoutclonus. The strength was reduced to 4/5 in the right upper andright lower extremities , however , the exam was questionable as sheseemed to have a varying exam depending on the examiner and time ofexam. She also demonstrated decreased fine finger movements on theright.HOSPITAL COURSE: Problem #1 ) Headache. The patient has a historyof chronic headaches for which she was maintainedon Fioricet in the past. Over the first week of hospitalization ,she complained of increasing headache that prevented her fromlooking into the light as well as prevented her from ambulating outof the bed. At times , she complained of intermittent visualsymptoms. These headaches were not completely relieved by Demerol ,Percocet or Tylenol. She was eventually tried on Fioricet whichapparently produced good relief of the headaches. She was seen byneurology and noted with a questionably abnormal neuro exam withfindings localized to the right side. Apparently she has a historyof this abnormality in the past. A CT scan revealed what wasapparently old damage from the previous motor vehicle accident. AnMRI was entirely within normal limits. She refused a lumbarpuncture. At this time , the headaches are thought to be eithervascular in origin or psychogenic. She was continued on Fioricetat the time of discharge. Problem #2 ) Hypertension. She hadelevated blood pressures of 150-160 over as high as 110 uponadmission. She has a history of chronic hypertension in the pastand was at least briefly maintained on hydrochlorothiazide before.She had a negative work up for PET , including repeat 24 hour urinesand repeat PET labs. As well , she had no physical findingsconsistent with PET. Given her history of chronic hypertension , wefelt this was most likely chronic hypertension aggravated bypregnancy. She was begun on a beta blocker , namely labetolol , withgood control. She was discharged to home on labetolol. Problem#3 ) History of seizure disorder. She carries the diagnosis of aseizure disorder , although this is , at least recently , poorlydocumented. She has been on valproic acid in the past and has beentaking a small dose of valproic acid apparently on her ownthroughout this pregnancy. She has been taking 250 mg a week. Shelast noted an obvious seizure three years ago. It is not clearthat this was witnessed by anyone else. While in the hospital , shehad an EEG which suggested some slowing in the right parietalregion. There was no clear seizure activity seen on EEG. Shecalled us to her room on several episodes which she described asseizures. These seizures were witnessed by several physicians andwere remarkable for absence of a postictal period as well asabnormal idiosyncratic behaviors during the events. It was ourfeeling that these were not true seizures. Indeed , reviewing herchart , she has had episodes of what have been called pseudoseizuressimilar to these in the past. Given her multiple drug allergies ,including Dilantin , phenobarb and tegretol , we felt limited in ourtherapeutic options. We did elect to increase her dose of valproicacid as this has apparently been effective in the past. She willcontinue this as an outpatient. Problem #4 ) Nausea and vomiting.She complained of persistent nausea and vomiting during the latterpart of her hospitalization and declined to take anything p.o. Theetiology of this nausea and vomiting was unclear , althoughapparently associated with some diarrhea. As much as was possible ,work up for an organic cause of the problem was negative. Weelected initially to treat her with intravenous hydration , however ,she declined further IV's. In fact , she became quite vocal in herdemand to go home. She understands our concerns as to the risks ofpoor p.o. intake and insists she will be able to take in p.o.'s athome. Given her feelings in this regard , we have elected todischarge her for a trial of outpatient management. Follow up willbe in the clinic. Should she show evidence of compromise ordehydration , she will be readmitted. Problem #5 ) Psychosocial.The patient has been seen several times in the past for behavioraldisorders. It is difficult to sort out what part of hersymptomatology is organic and what , if any , is inorganic. She wasseen by psychiatry during her stay here who felt that she had asignificant conflict in her home life. We have counseled her asmuch as possible throughout her stay. She has seen both socialservices and psychiatry , however , she is at best reluctant to availherself of these services. Our plan at the time of discharge isfor follow up with DSS. As well , we have emphasized ouravailability to the patient at all times and tried to be assupportive as possible in these circumstances.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged for a trial of managementat home. The etiology of her discomfort is somewhatobscure , however , we have as best as possible ruled out obviousmajor organic pathology , including PET , central CNS processes andfulminant hypertension.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.

Further information regarding her symptomatology isnot currently available as the patient's initial mental statuswas quite poor.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Significant for hypertension , diabetes , glaucoma ,hypercholesterolemia , history of alcohol abuse , history ofcoronary artery disease.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Not available currently in detail but included aspirin 325 mg andPlavix 25 mg p.o. q.d.ALLERGIES:She is allergic to NSAIDs , penicillin and Diltiazem.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION:Revealed her to be lethargic , obese. Her face is slightlyasymmetric with some left cheek swelling. Her neck revealed nobruits. Her heart was irregularly irregular. Her lungs revealedbibasilar crackles. Her extremities had 1+ pitting edemabilaterally. Neurologic examination: The only focal findingswere a transient skewed deviation of her eyes. Furtherinformation regarding this is not currently available. Focalweakness and numbness were not delineated upon initialevaluation.SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unitgiven her initial imaging findings. These findings were that shehad an occlusion , flat high-grade stenosis of the distal basilarartery. There was no acute infarction noted. Based on thesefindings , she was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unitand placed on intravenous heparin. Her neurologic statusgradually improved throughout her hospitalization. She did notcomplain of diplopia after the first day of her hospitalization.She also was quite awake after the first day of herhospitalization. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging done on10/21/03 revealed a new left cerebellar infarct with persistenthigh-grade stenosis of the basilar artery which did appear a bitmore patent than the initial scan done on 10/20/03. At the timeof her discharge , she was being transitioned from heparin toCoumadin and she was neurologically intact. With regard to hercardiovascular status , the patient initially ruled in for an MIbased on positive cardiac markers. Her peak troponin-I was 11.02and her peak CKMB was 18.4. She had lateral T-wave inversionsthat were new compared to her old EKGs. She was brought to thecardiac catheterization laboratory where it was found that shehad multiple moderate stenoses but without any high-grade orcritical stenoses. She was found however to have an elevatedwedge pressure of approximately 30 cm. Echocardiogram done on10/30/03 revealed an ejection fraction of 60%. She had a mildlydilated left atrium. It was found that she had moderatetricuspid regurgitation. Her pulmonary artery pressures wereelevated to 51 mL of mercury. She also is found to have moderatemitral regurgitation. Based on the findings of hercatheterization and elevated wedge pressures , the patient wasdiuresed relatively aggressively. She was also given high dosesof beta-blockade. Her troponin and CKMB levels did decreaseafter this. She remained weight controlled with beta-blockade.There was some discussion of possibly cardioverting her , butgiven her recent stroke this will be deferred. With regard toher blood pressure management , she has been managed while at aninpatient with hydralazine and Lopressor. A decision was madenot to introduce an ACE inhibitor at this time given her recent_____ and her baseline renal insufficiency ( 1.8-1.9 ). Theaddition of an ACE inhibitor may be indicated at some point inthe near future.DISCHARGE PLAN:The patient will be discharged to Mitent HealthHospital.FOLLOW UP PLANS:The patient will see her primary care physician , Marco Kenouo ,at the Department of Medicine on 9/26/04. She will see Dr.Doyle Ghamdi of Neurology on 2/12/03 at 4 p.m. She will see Dr.Toney Montagna at the Department of Cardiology on 10/4/04.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , heparin drip being transitioned toCoumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. with goal INR of 2-3 , folic acid 1 mgp.o. q.d. , hydralazine 75 mg p.o. q.i.d. , metoprolol 125 mg p.o.t.i.d. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Cosopt 1 drop o.u. b.i.d. ,Nexium 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.eScription document: 1-6195237 EMSSten TelDictated By: GOODNIGHT , ZACHARYAttending: NIEDZWIECKI , JEROME WESTONDictation ID 0448815D: 1/15/03T: 1/15/03

He was takento the operating room in the beginning of July for irrigationand debridement of the aforementioned joints. The cultures weresignificant for enterococcus and he was started on IV antibioticsand discharged to Motle Health Services . At Cial Memorial Hospital , he continued tocomplain about bilateral knee swelling as well as shoulder andwrist pain and was therefore brought back for a repeat wash outand reassessment.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: BPH , pacemaker , atrial fibrillation.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post bilateral total kneereplacement approximately 10 years ago , status post left ankleORIF.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:1.

Left wrist tender to examination withdecreased strength of wrist extension , finger flexion andintrinsics to 3 out of 5. Right shoulder and both knees withonly slightly decreased range of motion and little pain onpassive range of motion. Neurovascularly intact.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on9/3/05 for arthroscopic irrigation and debridement of both kneesas well as the right shoulder. There was a small effusion inboth knees which was aspirated prior to the irrigation and sentto the laboratory. These cultures show no growth to date withnegative gram stain. The right shoulder was ??_____?? withouteffusion. Intraoperative exam: No purulent discharge wasencountered , however there was mild inflammatory response in bothknees and right shoulder. The left wrist was treated withirrigation and debridement as well as a proximal ??_____??carpectomy by Dr. Edmond Augustave from hand surgery.Intraoperative cultures for fluid aspirate as well as bone tissuefrom the proximal ??_____?? carpectomy demonstrated coag negativestaph. Postoperatively , the patient was seen by physical therapyfor mobilization and weightbearing as tolerated with free rangeof motion of both knees and the right shoulder. He was placed inan Orthomold splint for the left wrist. On request of thepatient's daughter , Medicine was consulted but had littlerecommendations beyond small adjustments of his cardiovascularmedications.Also , Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended a changeof antibiotics to ampicillin and gentamicin and vancomycin totreat the coag negative staph in the left wrist aspirate as wellas to continue treatment of the previous enterococcus infection.No cultures from the current admission have demonstratedenterococcus. The patient also underwent a transthoracic echo ,however , the report is pending at the time of discharge.Finally , the patient was seen by Nutrition who recommended a??_____?? protein diet with supplements t.i.d.Lastly , the patient presents with chronically elevated PTT in arange of 40 to 70. After discussion with hematology , aninhibitor screen was sent , however , after the serum wasneutralized , PTT was found to be normal so likely the chronic PTTelevation was secondary to a hep block in his PICC line.The patient progressed well and was ambulating with minimalsupport at the time of discharge. He has remained afebrile withbenign-appearing incisions. He will be transferred to Mount Coursven Community Healthcare for further mobilization.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.

Status post PTCA in 2/18 , again with 99%occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending , which was 30%after PTCA; there was a small complication in which a focaldissection of the proximal left anterior descending was noted..PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Angioplasty as above.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n. Lopressor50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. Cardizem-SR 120 mg.b.i.d. Coumadin 2.5 mg. alternating with 3 mg. p.o. q. day.Lovastatin 20 mg. q. day. Glyburide 5 mg. q. day.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for cardiac disease. His father had lungcancer.SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and lives with wife and daughter.He has a 75-pack-year history of tobacco use. Hereportedly was smoking until two weeks prior to the onset ofillness. He denies any use of alcohol.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs at the Sno Valley Hospital CenterEmergency Room revealed temperature 102 ,respiratory rate 16 , blood pressure 160/78. At the Delf11 Valley Medical Center Emergency Room , temperature was 100.7 , heart rate96 , O2 saturations 95% on room air , blood pressure 128/80 ,respiratory rate 20. This was a well-developed , well-nourished ,white male who was somnolent but easily arousable. He was verydiaphoretic in the Emergency Room. Neck was supple with full rangeof motion and no lymphadenopathy. The JVP was flat. Lungsrevealed anterior bronchial breath sounds in the left upper lungfield. Lungs were clear to auscultation posteriorly.Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm withoccasional premature beats. An S1 and S2 were heard. There wereno no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. Abdomen was soft and nontender.Bowel sounds were present. No masses or hepatosplenomegaly wasnoted. On rectal exam , he had heme-negative , brown stool , and hehad a normal tone; this was per the Emergency Room staff.Extremities revealed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. Neurologicexam revealed cranial nerves III through XII were intact. He wasalert and oriented x three. Motor and sensory exam revealed 5/5bilaterally. Reflexes were 0 to 1+ bilaterally and symmetrically.Toes were downgoing. He had normal bulk and tone throughout.X-RAY: Chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe infiltrate , and thiswas per the Ontmang Hospital . A repeat chest x-rayhere on 5/25/95 again showed extensive left upper lobe pneumonia.ELECTROCARDIOGRAM: The electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinusrhythm at 89 with occasional prematureventricular contractions. He had a Q-wave inversion in lead 3 andAVF , biphasic V3.LABORATORY DATA: Fluid balance panel revealed sodium 131 ,potassium 3.4 , BUN and creatinine 23 and 1.4 ,chloride and bicarb 98 and 23 , glucose 194. His LDH was elevatedslightly at 259. His other liver function tests were within normallimits. His total protein was 5.7 , albumin 3.0. His hemoglobinand hematocrit were 14.4 and 43.3 , respectively. White blood cellcount was 12 , 100 with a differential of 84% polys , 5% bands , 6%lymphs , and 2% monos. Platelet count was 188 , 000. His urinalysiswas significant for white blood cells and red blood cells that weretoo numerous to count. He had 3+ bacteria.HOSPITAL COURSE:PROBLEM #1: PNEUMONIA , LEFT UPPER LOBE. The patient received 1 g.of Cefuroxime at the Sontro Cle Healthcare and wastransferred to the Termmette Medical Center where Cefotaxime1 g. eight hours was begun. The patient continued to spiketemperatures on hospital days #1 and #2 , although blood and urinecultures remained negative. On hospital day #3 , Erythromycin wasadded to his antibiotic regimen as the patient continued to spiketemperatures. The following day , the patient defervesced andremained afebrile throughout the hospital course. As mentionedearlier , a repeat chest x-ray here again showed extensive leftupper lobe pneumonia. Clinically , the findings from the physicalexam showed a resolution of the bronchial breath sounds. On theday of discharge , the patient's lungs were clear to auscultationbilaterally. The patient had been afebrile for four days and hadbeen on Erythromycin orally for two days. The intravenousCefotaxime was also discontinued two days prior to discharge atwhich point the intravenous Erythromycin was changed to orally at500 mg. q.i.d. The patient was instructed that he should avoid theuse of tobacco as this would increase his likelihood ofredeveloping pneumonia as well as increase his likelihood ofworsening cardiac disease. A sputum sample was induced , and it wassent for routine culture and AFB culture and smear. The cultureswere negative , and the AFB smear was negative for mycobacteria.The cultures were negative on discharge.PROBLEM #2: URINARY TRACT INFECTION. The patient was treatedwith Cefotaxime which was also used for treatment ofhis pneumonia. He was noted to have urinary incontinence , and byreport , the incontinence had begun approximately four or five daysprior to admission. It was felt that the incontinence might besecondary to his ongoing infection. A repeat urinalysis was sentapproximately four days after admission and showed 1 to 2 whiteblood cells and 0 bacteria. The patient , at that point , no longerwas having urinary incontinence; however , he was noted to have alarge postvoid residual of 300 cc. It was felt that this might berelated in part to mild benign prostatic hypertrophy. Dr. Nydam ,his primary care physician , is aware and will pursue furtherwork-up as necessary.PROBLEM #3: ATAXIA. The patient was noted by the family membersto be somewhat ataxic at home. The onset of thisataxia was in relation to his current illness; however , given thefact that he was on Coumadin , and due to the fact that he hadsustained a fall in the evening of admission , a CT scan wasperformed to rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The CT scan wasnegative for hemorrhage and showed age-appropriate atrophy. ANeurology consult was also requested , and recommendations for theCT scan , as already discussed , were made. In addition , theyrecommended that we check an RPR , B12 , folate , and TSH. Theresults are as follows: RPR was nonreactive. The first draw ofB12 was 233 , which is slightly low normal. A repeat B12 was 564 ,which is within normal limits. His folate was normal at 4.9. HisTSH was slightly low at 0.44. A Physical Therapy consult was alsoobtained to assist the patient with exercises to improve hisstrength. By discharge , the patient was able to ambulate withoutdifficulty. He was having no ataxia , whatsoever. We feel , inpart , that some of this ataxia may have been related to generalizedweakness that was associated with his current illness.PROBLEM #4: DIABETES MELLITUS. On admission , the patient'sglucose was 194. Due to his oral intake , we electedto hold his Glyburide and to give him insulin subcu. on a slidingscale basis as needed. By hospital day #4 , the patient's p.o.intake had improved , and we resumed Glyburide 5 mg. p.o. q. daywith sliding scale p.r.n. We continued Accucheks on a b.i.d.basis. His glucose tended to run in the low 200s. His glucosewill need to be followed as an outpatient , and perhaps one mightconsider a glucometer for him at home to ensure that he has goodglucose control.PROBLEM #5: HEMATOLOGIC. The patient was admitted on Coumadin ,which he takes as follows: 2.5 mg. alternating with3 mg. On admission , his INR was 1.8. His INR was rechecked on6/2/95 and was noted to be 4.8. His Coumadin was held for a coupleof days , and his INR was rechecked on the day of discharge; it was2.4 on the day of discharge. We feel that the elevation in his INRwas probably related to his being on antibiotics. I have mentionedthis to his primary care doctor , Dr. Reimer He will follow up onhis clinic visit on Monday , 7/22/95.LABORATORY PENDING ON DISCHARGE: Legionella antigen , obtained on10/2/95. Repeat stool forClostridium difficile toxin on 1/5/95 ; however , the patient'sdiarrhea has diminished , and we do not think that this is relatedto Clostridium difficile.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg. p.o. q. day. Cardizem-SR120 mg. p.o. b.i.d. Erythromycin 500 mg.p.o. q.i.d. x eight days. Glyburide 5 mg. p.o. q. day. Lovastatin20 mg. p.o. q. day. Coumadin 2 mg. p.o. q. day. Nitroglycerin 0.4mg. tablets sublingual q. five minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain;the patient is to notify the M.D. if the pain fails to resolveafter three tablets or if he should become light-headed whiletaking those tablets.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home.FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Elvis Alcantas inclinic on Monday , 7/22/95.Dictated By: CLAUDE TERRIAN , M.D.Attending: ROOSEVELT J.

MD , PHDADDENDUMPlease note this is an addendum to the previously dictateddischarge summary #6047544.INTERIM HISTORY: In the interim , since the previously dictateddischarge summary , the patient has continued to progress from acardiac standpoint.HOSPITAL COURSE: His hospital course by system from 10/25/05through the date of discharge is as follows:1. Ischemia: The patient had continued to remain stable from anischemia standpoint. He continues on aspirin and statin. Abeta-blocker has been added back to his regimen and was titratedto a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. The patient has notbeen started on an ACE inhibitor secondary to his elevatedcreatinine at this time. He has had no further episodes of chestpain.2. Pump: The patient's congestive heart failure regimen wastitrated. The patient continues on Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. andhydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. for after load reduction. He wasrestarted on a low-dose beta-blocker at 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. aswell as digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d. The patient wasaggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix and Zaroxolynfollowed by conversion to oral diuresis with torsemide at thetime of discharge. The patient will be followed by Dr. Rayford Hogenmiller in the Clevesa Irvca Sideenandri as well as by theCHF Service at Sher-ship Rimark's Medical Center . At the time ofdischarge , the patient was felt to be nearing euvolemia withestimated dry weight of approximately 76 to 77 kg.3. Rhythm: The patient continued to have atrial flutter with ablock. His heart rate remained in the rate of 100 to 110 at thetime of discharge. He had decreased episodes of more rapiddysrhythmia following addition of beta-blocker and digoxin to hismedication regimen. He also continues on amiodarone at 200 mgp.o. q.d. As mentioned , the patient was found to have atrialclot on transesophageal echocardiogram and thus was started on aheparin drip and transitioned on Coumadin. However , after asubstantial discussion with the Congestive Heart Failure Serviceand the patient's outpatient CHF Care Team , it was felt that therisks of Coumadin in this patient who has a history ofsignificant noncompliance were greater than the known risk ofthromboembolic disease in the setting of his known atrial clotand thus the patient was not continued on Coumadinanticoagulation. Rather , he was given aspirin and Plavix at fulldoses. The use of Coumadin in this patient could be re-evaluatedas an outpatient based on the patient's follow-up as deemedappropriate by his outpatient providers.4. Endocrine: The patient remained on stable diabetes mellitusregimen of Lantus 5 units q.p.m. and standing NovoLog 3 unitsq.a.c. as well as the NovoLog sliding scale. The patient'sinsulin regimen can be adjusted as an outpatient and possiblyoral diabetes medications restarted.5. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from the pulmonarywith good oxygen saturations on room air at rest and withambulation.6. Renal: The patient's creatinine on the day prior todischarge was 1.6 improved from the peak of greater than 2.Renal toxic medications were avoided. The patient had not beenrestarted on ACE inhibitor , which could be done as an outpatientas his renal function stabilizes. His electrolytes weremonitored and repleted aggressively.7. Hematology: As mentioned , the decision was made not toanticoagulate the patient with outpatient Coumadin. He wasstarted on aspirin and Plavix. Of note , the patient also haddecreased platelets in the setting of heparin anticoagulation andthus anti-P4 antibody was sent. This test is pending at the timeof the dictation , but should be followed up by the patient'soutpatient providers as it may input further treatment. In themeantime , recommend no heparin products. As mentioned , thedecision was made by the CHF Team who will be following thepatient as an outpatient not to continue Coumadinanticoagulation.8. Neuro: Of note , on the evening of 5/2/05 , the patientcomplained of left-sided blurry vision , which was new for thepatient. He does have chronic right visual changes. In light ofthe patient's known peripheral atherosclerotic disease and atrialclot , the patient was seen by the Stroke Team for a question ofacute stroke. He had MRI at that time , which did show multipleold infarcts in the right frontal , right occipital , leftoccipitoparietal , left posterior frontal areas. There was ,however , no new stroke seen on the MRI. The left internalcarotid artery was not evaluated , not visualized on the MRI andthere was concern for left carotid artery occlusion versusstenosis. The patient declined any procedure such as carotidendarterectomy or carotid stenting for his possible carotidstenosis and due to this denial no workup with the CTA was done.It was felt that because the patient would decline anyintervention the risk of contrast in the setting of his acuterenal insufficiency would outweigh the benefits of the study.The patient declined any intervention for his carotid arteries onseveral occasions. A carotid noninvasives were ordered and arepending at the time of this dictation to evaluate the severity ofdisease.9. Social: The patient's sister , Alexis Fernendez , is his health careproxy. The patient in her presence has declined coronary arterybypass grafting and heart transplant evaluation. The patient hasalso declined further procedure for his probable carotid arterystenosis.10. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to the Com Medical Center for further rehabilitation. He will follow up with Dr.Kyle Yandle in the T Las on 8/23/05 at 08:30 a.m. as wellas with Dr. Clyde Chatampaya of Elmert HospitalCardiology 10/25/05. He also has a follow-up appointment withTRISTONTERN MEDICAL CENTER PCP , Raymond Banaag , on 8/26/05 at 01:50 p.m. The patientrequires substantial social support at this time , which is beingprovided by his sister.MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:1.

The patient has a long historyof left lower extremity DVT's. She had her first DVT approximatelyten years ago. She has had approximately one to two DVTs per yearthereafter. According to her report , the DVTs have always been inthe left lower extremity. Also , her record shows that she has onlyhad DVTs in her left lower extremity. The longest duration of symptoms from aDVT was approximately for one to two years. She has hadmultiple other episodes of left lower extremity swelling and pain. Thepatient states that she would not always go to the hospital fortreatment , but instead would self treat herself by raising her legwhen immobile. Nonetheless , she has had approximately four DVTs inthe past year. Her last two admissions for DVTs were as follows:From 3/6 to 5/1/95 she had left popliteal and greater saphenousDVTs by lower extremity non invasive testing. She was discharged atthat time but did not fill her Coumadin prescription. She was thenreadmitted on 3/23/95 and discharged on 1/1/95 with a left commonfemoral DVT by lower extremity non invasive testing.Since the last admission , the patient adamantly states that she wasvery compliant to Coumadin therapy. She states that she has hadincreased pain and swelling in the left lower extremity. She alsostates that she has been relatively active at home ( she doesgardening , cleans the house , goes for walks ). When not active , thepatient states that she elevates her legs. Despite all of this ,the patient has noted gradual increase of left lower extremityswelling and pain which has became intolerable on the day ofpresentation.DVT RISK FACTORS: No trauma to the lower extremities , no priorsurgery to the onset of DVT. No knownhypocoagulable state. No oral contraceptives used. No hormonereplacement therapy. No significant immobilization. The patient isobese , she has had three miscarriages and she smokes. Also of notethe patient had a factor V level , which was normal. No otherstudies have been done by patient report or discharge report.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies any fevers , chills , sweats ,nausea or vomiting , diarrhea , bright red bloodper rectum , melena , chest pain , pleuritic chest pain , chestpressure , cough , or dysuria. However , the patient has had asignificant toothaches bilaterally for the past two weeks. Also , ofparticular note , the patient gives a history of sudden onset ofshortness of breath , lasting for approximately 30 minutes or so ,almost every evening. She states that the shortness of breath isrelieved with oxygen therapy , as she has at home. She never haspleuritic chest pain or cough with these episodes.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Recurrent DVTs x 10 years; 2 ) obesity andobstructive sleep apnea; 3 ) restrictive lungdisease; 4 ) hypertension; 5 ) atypical chest pain; 6 ) GERD; 7 )depression; 8 ) status post herniorrhaphy in September of 1994.PFTs from September of 1994 show an FVC of 1.85 , which is 56%predicted. FEV-1 of 1.61 , which is 59% predicted. MVC/FEV-1 ratioof 107% predicted. DLCO corrected 61%. TLC of 3.32 , which is 64% predicted.ECHO results from 1994 show an ejection fraction of 55% , with anormal right ventricular function and size.The patient is on home 02 , approximately two to three liters bynasal cannula. Her baseline dyspnea on exertion is approximatelyfive steps or approximately 1/4 block , but always without chestpain or substernal chest pressure.PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY: She is G VIII , P V with three mis-carriages in the first trimester.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Coumadin , 7.5 mg q day; 2 ) Zoloft ,60 mg q day; 3 ) Lasix , 20 mg q day; 4 )Axid , 150 mg b.i.d.TOBACCO: 30 years x one half pack per day; currently smoking.ALCOHOL: No alcohol use.IVDU: Cocaine , no use.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: She has a positive family history for cancer. Hermother had cancer and died at a young age but shedid not know her mother. Her grandmother had skin cancer. There isno diabetes mellitus; coronary artery disease , bleeding or clottingproblems or lung problems in her family.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is from Ellno Rd andwas raised by her grandmother. She has four livingchildren and one child who recently passed away. She has beendepressed after the death of her last child. She is now livingwith her son in Barin Ln , I Ville Joseri , HawaiiPHYSICAL EXAM: The patient is a very obese , black female in noapparent distress. She was not tachypneic.Temperature 97.3 , blood pressure 112/74 , pulse 64 , respiratory rate16. Oxygen saturation of 88% on room air , which increased to 93%on two liters nasal cannula. Skin was warm and dry. There were norashes , bruising or petechiae noted. HEENT - pupils equally roundand reactive to light and accommodation. EOMI. Sclera anicteric.Neck supple with a full range of motion , no lymphadenopathy , noJVD; oropharynx moist and pink. Tongue midline with a mottledpigmentation. Tonsils bilaterally enlarged with a small airwaynoted. The left upper two molars were tender to minimal palpation.The right upper molar was also tender. Lungs clear to auscultationbilaterally but decreased breath sounds in the bases. Heart -regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , rubs or gallops.Abdomen soft , non tender , obese , positive bowel sounds , negativeorganomegaly; vertical midline scar , no CVAT. Rectal examinationwas hemenegative. Extremities - there was significant left lowerextremity swelling noted up to the thigh with positive pittingedema to the calf. There was also tenderness on the left innerthigh anteriorly. There was also marked tenderness on the leftcalf. There was no erythema. The left calf measured 41.5 cm.There was an impressive homan's sign. The right lower extremityhad minimal swelling noted without tenderness , erythema or warmth.The right calf measured 36.0 cm. Neuro exam non focal.LABORATORY DATA: Notable for a Bicarbonate of 34 , hematocrit of48.2 , and RDW of 17.4 and MCV of 75.4; whiteblood cell count of 4.9 with a normal differential. Her PTT was21.6 , INR of 3.2 , PTT of 45.0. Chest x-ray showed no pulmonaryedema or pneumonia. There was bibasilar atelectasis , which was notchanged from prior x-ray. LIMA showed left common femoral veinDVT , left popliteal vein DVT and distal left saphenous vein DVT.VQ scan was read as low probability , which was comparable to herprevious VQ scan in September of 1995 , which was low probability.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was evaluated for recurrent DVT andpossible pulmonary embolus and treated with intravenousheparin. We had a low clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolus and the VQ scanwas also low probability. The patient was seen by the cardiology service toevaluate if the patient was a candidate for IVC filter placement.Cardiology felt that the patient was not at risk for pulmonaryembolus and that her recurrent DVTs were of a more result of noncompliance and/or never completing a full course of anticoagulationtherapy. Thus , the plan was to continue to anticoagulate thepatient and follow her as an outpatient. However , the patientcontinued to have tooth pain and was seen by the dental service. On1/17/95 , she had two molars extracted , one on each side of theupper dentition. Her dental surgery was uncomplicated. Aftersurgery , she was continued on Heparin and anticoagulated withCoumadin. The patient continued to do well. However , the patient'shospital course was notable for multiple episodes of suddenshortness of breath , usually occurring during the evening. Theshortness of breath would come on suddenly , sometimes when she wasasleep and sometimes when she was awake. The shortness of breathwould last for approximately 30 minutes or so and would be relievedwith oxygen therapy by nasal cannula. The patient states that thishistory of sudden shortness of breath is usual for her and hasoccurred for several months. There were no associated symptoms offevers , chills , sweats , pleuritic chest pain , chest pressure ,palpitations or cough. We did not suspect that she was havingmultiple PE's. The patient was sent home with an INR of 3.2.In any case , the patient was slow to respond while in house toanticoagulation with Warfarin. She required approximately six daysof Warfarin at the following doses - 12.5 , 9/14 7.5 and 10 mg ofCoumadin before obtaining an INR greater than 3.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Lasix , 20 mg q day; 2 ) Nifedipine XL , 30mg q day; 3 ) Zoloft , 50 mg q d; 4 ) Axid ,150 mg b.i.d.; 5 ) Coumadin , 7.5 mg alternating with 10 mg P O qday.FOLLOW UP: The patient is scheduled to have a follow upappointment with Dr. Delbo on 7/25/95 at 9:40 AM. She is tohave VNA service to her home to check her INR level tomorrow. HerPT/PTT results will be reported to Jae Hobbie , a nursepractitioner at the Sa More Memorial Hospital BRY CENTER Clinic.Dictated By: OTTO ROSENWINKEL , JL6Attending: JAVIER L.

She wasrelatively well with diabetes and hypertension at her baselineuntil approximately 8 of September when she had a left common femoralangioplasty at Sideplea Memorial Hospital .In 27 of May , she had a left fem/pop for vascular insufficiency , andher hospitalization at that time was complicated by some mentalstatus changes and a fever of unknown etiology.In 7 of March , she presented to NORSTOOKTRINA HOP UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH with an upper respiratory infec-tion and received pneumovax. In 28 of February , she was recurrently seenin DAUTE ONTKEEAR MEDICAL CENTER for coughs and colds. In 25 of October , she had a Landutchess Hospital admission for three days of cough , purulent sputum andshortness of breath.On admission , she was on her insulin and inhalers. She wastreated with intravenous Cefotetan and IV steroids for reactiveairways disease. The patient improved slowly and steadily on ataper.On 5 of May , the patient was complaining of increasing lethargy , asick feeling , was cold and clammy and called her medical doctor.Approximately 15 minutes later , the patient was noted by herfamily to be unresponsive and EMTs were called. The patient wasfound to be hypotensive , diahporetic and nonverbal with a heartrate in the 20s and EKG that was consistent with complete heartblock.She was intubated , treated with Atropine in the field and broughtto the Waltwhidverstiicsonacot Medical Center emergency room. In the emergencyroom , her heart rate was noted to be 20. She appeared to be insinus arrest with a ventricular escaped rhythm. An externalpacer was placed. She was paced at 80 , had an increase in herblood pressure , was given calcium and resuscitated with fluids.A transvenous pacemaker was placed and captured effectively.LABORATORY DATA: ing intubated. Her bicarb was eight onadmission. BUN and creatinine were 48 and 2.3. Initial CK was28. She was given oriing intubated. Her bicarb was eight onadmission. BUN and creatinine were 48 and 2.3. Initial CK was28. She was given oriing intubated. Her bicarb was eight onadmission. BUN and creatinine were 48 and 2.3. Initial CK was28. She was given oriing intubated. Her bicarb was eight onadmission. BUN and creatinine were 48 and 2.3. Initial CK was28. She was given originally , in the emergency room , IV insulinas well and treated with antibiotics including Ceftriaxone ,Vancomycin and Gentamicin and transferred to the cardiac careunit because there were no NICU beds available. Allergies: Noknown allergies. She does not smoke or drink. She is currentlyliving with her daughter , one of 11 children. She has 66 grand-children and 30 great grandchildren. Medications on admissionincluded Verapamil 40 q. day; insulin 30 units NPH a day;Captopril 25 t.i.d.; Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.; andVentolin and Atrovent inhalers.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for hypertension , diabetes ,multiple rotator cuff injuries in thepast , the femoral and popliteal bypass procedure as noted aboveand noted to have an increased globulin in the past.HOSPITAL COURSE: In the unit , she had IV insulin startedfor presumed diabetic ketoacidosis. Thesinus arrest was presumed to be metabolic in origin due to hersevere acidosis hyperkalemia secondary to her diabetic ketoaci-dosis. In addition , she had been on high dose Verapamil withsome question of whether or not this was suppressing her sinusnode.She was maintained on IV insulin for approximately two days buthad a persistent metabolic acidosis. Because of some abdominaltenderness which was hard to gauge given her decreased mentalstatus while she was intubated , she underwent an abdominal CTthat was unremarkable , although very mild pancreatitis was noted.She had a concomitant rise in her amylase and lipase to approxi-mately 270 and 1 , 290 respectively.Her LFTs showed a picture consistent with shock liver with hertransaminases going up to approximately 1 , 000-2 , 000 range and theLDH in the 2 , 000-3 , 000 range. It resolved over time as her bloodpressure returned to normal. Her antibiotics were changed toAmpicillin , Gentamicin and Flagyl for concern of an abdominalsource despite the negative CT , and her low grade fevers per-sisted for a few days but then she defervesced.On 3 of November , she was transferred to the floor after having receivedapproximately five days of intravenous insulin and a resolutionof her hyperglycemia and ketosis.Her hospital course on the floor was notable for a titration ofher insulin dose. Of note , her insulin dose was as high asapproximately 30-35 units of NPH q. day in a setting of havingreceived steroids initially on admission and they were continued.Her steroids were weaned rapidly and , once steroids were stoppedher insulin requirement decreased markedly and she was only on 20units of NPH a day now.Of note , she had two episodes of hypoglycemia in the morning withblood sugars in the 20-30 range , one of which was asymptomaticbut one of which was associated with some shaking that respondedpromptly to administration of juice.From an infectious disease standpoint , she had no obvious sourcefor any of her fevers , and she defervesced. There was some ques-tion of aspiration surrounding her original intubation , so shewas maintained on approximately seven days of antibiotics andthen these were stopped. She was watched , and she remainedafebrile throughout her hospitalization.One day prior to discharge , she complained of some left gum pain.Exam showed a very mild swelling and some focal tenderness butwas unremarkable. Because of this , she was started on Peni-cillin 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. which will be continued for seven days.From a renal standpoint , her baseline creatinine was 1.3 to 1.5range and it bumped to approximately 3.0 during hospitalization.She was being discharged with her creatinine of approximately1.7. Her urine output had been excellent.From a cardiovascular standpoint , within three or four days ofher admission , her sinus arrest resolved in a setting of correc-tion of her metabolic derangement. Her pacemaker was removed ,and she had no further cardiac event.She was being discharged today in stable condition to the Beywell Hospital with the following discharge medications:Nifedipine 30 mg p.o. q.i.d.; Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day; Pepcid20 mg p.o. q. day; Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Clonidine 0.1 mgp.o. b.i.d.; Ecotrin 325 mg p.o. q. day; Albuterol 0.5 cc and2.5 cc normal saline q. three to four hours p.r.n.; insulin NPH20 units subcutaneous q.a.m.; Penicillin B 250 mg p.o. q.i.d.times one week; Peridex swish and swallow q.i.d.; and 5 , 000 unitsof subcutaneous heparin b.i.d. as long as she remains somewhatinactive. She takes an 1 , 800 kilocalorie ADA diet and low-saltand low-cholesterol diet as well.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Diabetic ketoacidosis.2. Sinus arrest.3. Diabetes mellitus.4.

Since then it has persisted andworsened , and she was seen by a primary care physician. Initialendoscopy was performed , which was suspicious for malignancy ,however , the patient was on Coumadin and no biopsy was obtainedat that time. She underwent a repeat upper endoscopy on August ,2005 at the Arma Healthcare Health The EGD revealed that Ms. Hinrichsenhad Barrett's esophagus as well as a nodule on the distalesophagus. No evidence of gastritis. A biopsy of the nodulerevealed poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma at 35 cm.It appeared to be rising in association with Barrett'sesophagitis. She also has a history of ischemic myopathy with anLVEF of approximately 20% and CAD with a history of bypass graftin 1992 and a biventricular ICD placed in October 2004. Sheunderwent an endoscopy on September , 2005 , an EUS revealed that shehad an intramural lesion in the distal esophagus measuring 2 cmin diameter invading into the muscularis propria , therefore shewas staged and having T3 , N0 , MX , and tumor by EUS. She was seenat Toards Health in mid July by both Dr. Tyrell Aningalanfrom Medial Oncology and Dr. Wahlen from Radiation Oncology. It wasfelt that she was a reasonable candidate for consideration ofchemoradiation. She therefore began her chemoradiation andradiotherapy , chemotherapy including Taxol and cisplatin.Approximately 1 week prior to admission on February , 2005 ,unfortunately , she reports over the course of the past week , shehas had increasing dysphagia to the point where she is havingtrouble swallowing liquids.

She is a homemaker. She does not smoke. She does notdrink except for occasionally.FAMILY HISTORY: She has a father with melanoma , and a motherwith an MI at the age of 59.REVIEW OF SYSTEM: She had no abdominal pain , no chest pain , noshortness of breath , no headache , and no joint pain.PHYSICAL EXAM: On admission ,VITAL SIGNS: Her temp was 97.4 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 87/56 ,respiratory rate 20 , saturating 98% on room air.GENERAL: She was an alert , oriented , cooperative female , who wasresting comfortably.HEENT: Her mucous membranes were dry , oropharynx clear. Pupilswere equal , round and reactive to right. Extraocular motionsintact.LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no crackles orwheezes.NECK: There is JVP at 7 cm , low lymphadenopathy. Her neck wassupple.CARDIOVASCULAR: She was irregularly regular with a 2/6 systolicejection murmur loudest at the apex.ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with positive bowelsounds. Her extremities had trace edema with no bruising.LABORATORY DATA: Her admission labs were notable for potassiumof 2.9 , BUN of 37 and creatinine of 1.6. Her LFTs and CBC werewithin normal limits. Her INR on admission was 2.7. Her albuminwas 3.7 , mag 1.5. Her UA was negative. Her EKG showed a rightbundle branch block with A-fib , A-flutter with occasional pacedbeats from her pacer. Her chest x-ray was clear.ASSESSMENT: This 77-year-old female with a history of CAD , CHFand esophageal cancer presenting with lightheadedness , however ,having nausea and vomiting , most likely her symptoms are due todehydration. Unlikely a cardiac cause given no chest pain , nopalpitation , and obviously decreased p.o.PLAN:1. Lightheadedness: Poor p.o. intake and dehydration.Nutrition was consulted to evaluate regarding the possible stentin esophagus. She will be treated with gentle hydrationovernight , measure orthostatics , holding Lasix.2. Cardiovascular: History of CHF with an EF of 20% , checkingBNP and monitor on tele for arrhythmia , continue digoxin , Diovan ,Lopressor , continue Imdur , continue Lasix while hydrating.3. Esophageal Cancer: Got XRT. On the day of admission , shewill continue XRT.4. Nausea: Rx for Zofran and replete potassium.5. Hypothyroidism: Continue Synthroid.6. GERD: Continue Prevacid.7. A-fib: Continue Coumadin.8. Hyperlipidemia: Continue Zocor.9. FEN: Replete electrolytes p.r.n. , diabetic diet , andmultivitamin.10. Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin and Prevacid.11. Full code.BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Lightheadedness: It was felt that all of her lightheadednesswas most likely due to dehydration. Her lightheadedness improvedwith hydration , it was most likely due to poor p.o. intake.Nutrition evaluated her and suggested high calorie supplements ,however , she continued to be nauseated and unable to take goodp.o. GI was consulted regarding possible stenting of heresophagus given that she had an intra-esophageal lesion thatcould potentially be causing this nausea. She was also orderedfor a barium swallow. On the barium swallow , there was a strictstenotic lesion of the esophagus , which is not allowed any foodto pass through. An EGD was performed , which showed some foodabout a tight stenosis that was unable to be passed. Based uponthis it was felt that she would benefit from a G-tube.Interventional radiology was consulted and placed a G-tubewithout complication. Tube feeds were begun and she toleratedthem well without complication. She has been continued on tubefeeds and is currently at goal of 360 cc four times a day , with ascoop of promod , these will be continued upon discharge.2. TIA/CVA: On the evening of 5/24/05 , it was noted that shehad decreased ability to move the left side of her body. Basedupon this , a STAT CT and CTA was performed. The CT showed nobleeding , and during the CT scan , she regained all function inthe left side , however , the CTA did note a large friable clotwithin her right ICA. Based upon her high level of heart diseaseand high risk for an operative procedure , it was not felt thatshe would be a stent candidate at that time. She was continuedon Lovenox therapy with Coumadin with the plan to discharge heron medical management for this TIA. However , on the morning of8/16/05 , she was noted to have a new left-sided facial droop.She also had some left-sided weakness. A STAT CT , CTA once againshowed no bleed. At this point , the clot was noted to have movedfrom the right ICA into the MCA , and to have dissolved somewhat.Based upon this , it felt that she would have good recovery fromher stroke , and she was not a candidate for any sort ofintervention at that time. She was converted over to heparindrip with the plan to give her a heparin drip as bridging overwhile her Coumadin became therapeutic. She was continued onheparin drip until her INR was therapeutic. She will bedischarged on Coumadin and continued on Coumadin and aspirintherapy for life.3. Esophageal Cancer: She was continued on XRT for the entiretime when she was in the hospital. Conversations between Dr.Depaoli , Dr. Serl and the family were had and it was felt that shewas no longer a chemotherapy candidate given her poor status , interms of her other issues. She will be continued on XRT afterdischarge from the hospital.4. Acute Renal Failure: On admission , she was noted to have anincreased creatinine; it was felt to be most likely due todehydration. However , at the time of admission , she had a BUN of50% and a renal ultrasound was performed , the renal ultrasoundwas normal and showed no further defect over the course of herhospital stay. Her creatinine continued trending down and was0.9 on the day prior to discharge.5. CAD: She has a history of CHF with an EF of 50%. She wasmonitored on tele for arrhythmia and no arrhythmia was observed.She does of note have a right bundle branch block at baseline aswell as biventricular pacer with 1 lead out of place causing awide complex rhythm. There were multiple alarms for VT , whichwere simply her baseline rhythm. In the hospital , she wascontinued on digoxin , Lopressor , and Imdur. Her Lasix wasinitially held , while she was being hydrated , however , it wasrestarted after the G-tube was placed and she was gettingsufficient feeds. She was also continued on her statin. She hadno other cardiac issues while she was in the hospital.6. Nausea: She was treated with Zofran for her nausea when shewas admitted and she continued to have good response to this.7. Urinary Tract Infection: On the 25 of May she noted that she washaving increasing pain on urination and increasing burning , an UAwas done and it was found to be positive for infection. Aculture was performed , which showed enterobacter that waslevo-sensitive. She was started on Levaquin and the Foley , whichhad been placed prior was discontinued. She was continued onLevaquin for a 10-day course and this will be continued forseveral days after discharge.8. Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her Synthroid at herhome dosages while she was in-house.9. GERD: She was continued on Prevacid while she was in-house.10. A-fib: She was continued on Coumadin , although it was heldprior to her EGD and G-tube placement. During the time when shewas not therapeutic on her Coumadin she was treated with eitherLovenox subcu. or heparin IV drip titrated to a PTT of 60 to 80 ,therefore she was always therapeutic on her anticoagulin duringthis hospital stay.11. She was initially on a full diet , however , she was unable totake any p.o. so she was started on tube feeds , which she wasable to make her goal. Nutrition was involved in her care andshe was continued on multivitamin.12. She was on Lovenox or heparin drip throughout herhospitalization for DVT prophylaxis. She was also continued onPrevacid.CODE STATUS: Full Code , and remained full code throughout herhospitalization.COMMUNICATION: There was much communication between her familythroughout this hospitalization in terms of their wishes for hercare and for her discharge , and it was agreed that a rehab wouldbe a good place for to go at the end of her stay here.eScription document: 0-5879021 HFFocus transcriptionistsDictated By: CRAFTON , BENEDICTAttending: KONDERLA , KIRK TANNERDictation ID 3468577D: 11/7/05T: 11/7/05

Popliteal pulses 1 plus bilaterally. Dorsalis pedispulse was biphasic and so was the posterior tibialis bilaterally.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the manic vascularsurgery service and she underwent anuncomplicated debridement of the nonhealing ulcer on the leftlateral aspect of her left forefoot. The patient tolerated theprocedure well and was stable in the immediate postoperativeperiod. The patient was then transferred to the floor where sheunderwent a rapid progressive and uncomplicated course of recovery.The patient's hospital stay was protracted due to inability of thepatient to mobilize herself with the assistance of physicaltherapy. She was screened for rehabilitation placement at thistime but there was some difficulty in placement secondary to bednon-availability. This immobility is consistent with hermobilization ambulatory capacity at home as per her own report.The patient throughout the remainder of her hospital stay hadcontinued progressive healing of the wound on the lateral aspect ofher left forefoot with wet-to-dry dressing changes.

His nifedipine wasdiscontinued because of gingival hypertrophy and Atenolol wasreplaced. Shortly after that he developed increased dyspnea onexertion , shortness of breath , especially with walking in themorning. There was a question of light-headedness. He denied anychest pain , pressure , or tightness. No jaw , neck or arm symptoms.No orthopnea or PND. Her also denied visual symptoms or headache.One day prior to admission the patient was taking a walk and was sofatigued that he had to stop.

O2 saturation was 98% ontwo liters by nasal cannula. GENERAL: The patient is an elderlyAfrican-American gentleman , sitting up in bed in no acute distress ,talking in complete sentences. HEENT: The left eye has anonreactive pupil. The right eye has a small pupil , approximately2 mm , with a clear cataract. There is no icterus. The oropharynxwas clear with gingival hypertrophy. NECK: Supple , with fullrange of motion. There was no lymphadenopathy. JVP was difficultto assess because of the large neck. CARDIAC: Regular rate andrhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the base. The carotids werewithout bruits. PULMONARY: The patient had bibasilar rales withexpiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. ABDOMEN:Protuberant , soft , non-tender. Normoactive bowel sounds. Noorgans appreciated. EXTREMITIES: Edema 2+. Femoral pulses were2+. There were bruits. Distal pulses were intact.

CBC shows WBC 8 , hematocrit 32.9 , platelets 343 , MCVapproximately 80 , RDW approximately 16. Admission CK was 175.Troponin I was 0.05. Chest x-ray showed a questionable bibasilarinfiltrates. EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 56. The axis was 20degrees. The intervals were 0.175/10/96/0.471. There was LVH byvoltage criteria , an isolated Q in lead 3 , biphasic T waves in AVL ,and a flat T in lead 3.HOSPITAL COURSE: By problems:Congestive heart failure: The patient underwent a rule outmyocardial infarction protocol and subsequently did rule out.After that he had an exercise echo. The patient exercised forthree minutes on a modified Bruce , achieving a maximum heart rateof 97 and a blood pressure of 160. The test was stopped because ofknee pain and shortness of breath. Baseline images prior toexercise showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy , with overallnormal function. There were no resting wall motion abnormalities.Stress images obtained after peak exercise showed a suggestion of aposterobasilar hypokinesis. No other wall motion abnormalitieswere noted. It was felt that this findings were questionable fornonspecific finding or ischemia. It was felt that the EKG portionof the ETT showed no evidence for ischemia. The patient wasdiuresed gently with IV Lasix and his shortness of breath improved.Hypertension: On admission , the patient's blood pressure wasapproximately 220/110. The patient was started on IV nitroglycerinand IV Labetalol in the Emergency Department. The patient wassubsequently weaned from IV nitroglycerin and switched to p.o.hydralazine and minoxidil , 100 mg t.i.d. and 2.5 mg q d. ,respectively. The patient had excellent blood pressure control onthese medications. The patient was discharged with close follow-upin order to titrate these medications.Anemia: The patient's admission hematocrit was 32.2. Subsequenthematocrits were very labile , and there was felt to be some laberror involved. Follow-up hematocrit was in the mid 20s. This wasrepeated and was again in the mid 20s. He was transfused two unitsof packed red blood cells and underwent upper endoscopy. Thefindings were gastritis , with some small erosions in the antrum anda subcutaneous nodules , which was biopsied. H. pylori studies werepending at discharge , as were biopsy results. The patient wasstarted on Prilosec 20 mg q d. and will continue with this forseveral weeks. Aspirin was held , as the patient's EGD findingswere felt to be consistent with NSAID gastritis. Iron studiesobtained were not entirely consistent with iron deficient anemia.The serum iron was low. However , the ferritin and TIBC were withinthe normal range. Further workup of the patient's anemia will takeplace as an outpatient.Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine increasedfrom admission value of 2.0 to 2.5. This was felt to be secondaryto diuresis , and the patient's diuretic dose was decreased. Thepatient will need to have outpatient follow-up of his creatinine.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Albuterol inhaler two puffs as needed for shortness of breathand wheezing.2. Prilosec 20 mg q d.3. Symvastatin 10 mg q d.4. Nitroglycerin sublingual as needed for chest pain , pressure ortightness.5.

Infectious Disease. The patient was found to have MRSA ,septic arthritis complicated by septic shock , bacteremia andacute renal failure. He was brought to the operating room withremoval of his prosthetic knee and debridement of his surroundingarea with drain replacement. He was started on a 42-day courseof vancomycin 1 g q.12h. and is currently on day #18 as ofFebruary , 2005. He was also noted to have pneumonia on theleft side that bronchoscopy was also thought to be MRSApneumonia. Per ID consult , he was started the linezolid forbetter lung penetration and is currently on day #8 of 14. He hasbeen afebrile now with negative cultures since then. Of note , onbronchoscopy , there was cytopathic changes consistent with HSVinfection , and he was treated with a course of acyclovir also perinfectious disease this is probably unnecessary and presentedcontamination from an old lesion.2. Pulmonary. The patient had a nosocomial pneumonia with MRSAand was intubated for inability to handle secretions and mentalstatus changes. He had a tracheostomy placed and has beentolerating that breathing on trach collar during the day andresting on pressure support of 5 and 5 overnight.

The patient had a complicatedhospitalization in August where he presented with a severeright MRSA infection of his right lower extremity. Duringhospitalization , he required a revascularization prior toundergoing surgery and had a bare metal stent placed to his leftanterior descending artery. After his stenting , he underwent a left BKA toeradicate his left lowerextremity infection and was later noted to have aright upper extremity clot associated with central venous catheter. Thepatient was discharged from the hospital in August on Lovenox80 mg twice daily and on Coumadin with the plan that his Lovenoxbe stopped at the time of his Coumadin reaching a therapeuticlevel. He was also discharged on aspirin and Plavix for his baremetal stent. On the day prior to admission , the patient wasnoted to have a hematocrit of 24 at rehab and on the day ofadmission the Hct rechecked and was found to be 18. For this , he wastransferred to the Landm Hospital for furtherworkup. The patient denies any blood in the stool , melena ,dizziness or lightheadedness. He does note some pain on hisright side , particularly his right upper thigh and glutealarea. He denies any recent trauma. He felt some weakness in hisright leg but has had no paresthesias or pain. He states thathis leg has been at all times warm.ED COURSE:The patient was noted to be guaiac negative and complained ofsome mild abdominal fullness. He received an abdominal CT , whichshowed a very large right gluteal hematoma with a fresh fluidlevels suggesting acute bleed. The patient was given packed redblood cells and was noted to have a potassium level of 5.8 forwhich he received Kayexalate.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Type II diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease statuspost MI in 1997. He had a nonST elevation MI in 3/29 forwhich he underwent catheterization. Catheterization at that timeshowed an 80% left anterior descending lesion , which was stentedto 0 with a bare metal stent , 80% diagonal and first diagonallesion and a 100% circumflex lesion. The patient has knownsignificant peripheral vascular disease status post left TMA in4/3 with fem-pop in 4/3 , left foot debridement in 5/26and finally a left BKA in 6/26 He has congestive heartfailure with last ejection fraction of 32% , hyperlipidemia , gout ,CLL status post fludarabine x4 cycles in 2004 in which has beenstable with no evidence of residual or retroperitoneallymphadenopathy , BPH , chronic kidney disease with a baselinecreatinine of 2.5 , and glaucoma.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:Include aspirin 325 mg , Niferex 150 mg daily , Lasix 80 mg b.i.d. ,Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , Lovenox 80 mg b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg daily ,diltiazem 60 mg t.i.d. , hydralazine 20 mg t.i.d. , Lantus 42 unitsat night , NovoLog 10 units with meals , Lopressor 75 mg q.6h. ,Zocor 40 mg at night , Flomax 0.4 mg daily , Coumadin 10 mg daily ,multivitamin , vitamin C , zinc 220 mg daily , Neurontin 100 mgb.i.d. , Xalatan one drop in the left eye every evening.ALLERGIES:His allergies include codeine.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:The patient was in no acute distress. Normocephalic , atraumatic.His eyes were anicteric. His extraocular membranes were intact.Mucous membranes were moist without exudates. His neck wassupple , with full range of motion. He had 2+ carotid pulses onboth sides without any evidence of bruits. His jugular venouspressure was approximately 8 cm of water at 30 degrees ofelevation. His lungs were notable for bibasilar crackles withleft side greater than right. Cardiovascular exam: He hadregular sinus rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , and he had a I/VIsystolic ejection murmur at his base. This seemed to radiate tohis axilla. His abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended.He had normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants , nohepatosplenomegaly or masses. His extremities are notable for aright-sided gluteal hematoma with fullness and thickening. Hedoes have 1+ palpable DP pulse on that side confirmed withDoppler. Skin was without rash , ecchymosis , or petechiae. Hisneurological exam was intact. He was alert and oriented x3.Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact. He had intactmotor and sensation in his right lower extremity along with ,however , was noted to have a baseline neuropathy with sensoryloss up to his admission.Admission EKG is normal for normal sinus rhythm , normal axis , oldT-wave inversions in I and aVL and an isolated ST elevation inlead 2.Notable studies during this admission included CT of the abdomenon admission which showed a new right gluteal hematoma with fluidlevels suggesting acute bleed.ADMISSION LABS:Potassium 5.8 , creatinine 2.1 , hematocrit of 22.3. He had an MRIof his brain done on 5/29/06 which showed subacute infarction onthe right anterior internal capsule and chronic occlusion of theleft internal carotid and old left parietal stroke. He had anechocardiogram done on 10/1/06 with an ejection fraction of30-35% , trace aortic insufficiency , trace mitral regurgitation ,trace tricuspid regurgitation and PA systolic pressures of 33+right atrial pressure.IMPRESSION:This is a 62-year-old man admitted for a falling hematocrit withan evolving right gluteal hematoma secondary to supratherapeuticanticoagulation.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM IS AS FOLLOWS:1. Right gluteal hematoma. The patient was admitted for lowhematocrit in the setting of being on multiple anticoagulant andantiplatelet drugs. He was found to have right gluteal hematomawhich was responsible for his acute hematocrit drop. HisCoumadin , Lovenox , aspirin , and Plavix were initially held. Hereceived vitamin K and three units of FFP to reverse hiscoagulopathy. He was also transfused a total of 6 units of PRBCsfor a goal hematocrit of 30 given his cardiac and neurologicdisease as described below. There was no evidence of furtherhematocrit drop. Given that he had been anticoagulated due toright upper extremity DVT and that the indication foranticoagulation in the setting and catheter associated clot issomewhat murky , it was felt that the patient would not benefitfrom addition of anticoagulation and therefore his Lovenox andCoumadin were discontinued. He was restarted on his aspirin andand his Plavix and his Hct remained stable.2. Non-ST-elevation MI. The patient was admitted in Augustand was known to have three-vessel coronary disease and hadunderwent stenting of his LAD with a bare metal stent on6/28/06. After discussion with the cardiologist , he was stoppedon aspirin and Plavix given the evolution of hematoma and hisacute hematocrit drop. During his lowest hematocrit period , thepatient was noted to have lateral ST depressions and thiscorresponded to a troponin leak with a peak troponin of 2.46.The etiology of this was felt to be demand related to hisprofound anemia and on correction of his anemia , the patient's STdepressions resolved fully and his troponins trended downward.The patient was known to have a presumed ischemic cardiomyopathyfollowing his nonST elevation MI. He was found to have anejection fraction of 30-35%. He willneed to have a repeat echocardiogram done in one month's time toassess whether or not he would benefit from an implantablecardiac defibrillator. The patient's blood pressure medicationswere adjusted as follows. His blood pressure medications wereinitially held due to his stroke-like symptoms at the time ofadmission when his low hematocrit. As detailed below , however ,they were slowly added back. He tolerated slow titration ofbeta-blocker to goal heart rate and also addition of an ACEinhibitor which was felt to be important given his extensive peripheralvascular disease and hislow ejection fraction.3. Recrudescence of stroke-like symptoms in the setting of thepatient's acute hematocrit drop. The patient was noted to haveworsening slurred speech and a right facial droop. He does carrya history of left internal carotid occlusion and left-sidedstroke in the past. The Neurology team was consulted for these acute deficitsand requested an MRI. The MRI showed basically old known strokes and asubacute rightinternal capsule stroke that was felt to be unrelated to hiscurrent symptomatology. He initially had hisantihypertensives to allow for maximal perfusion pressure. However , ashis coagulopathy resolved , it was felt that the stress thatresulted in the recrudescence of his old stroke-like symptoms wasresolved and he was able tolerate , further addition of hisantihypertensives without further incident.DISPOSITION:The patient was seen by physical therapy and given his recentbelow the knee amputation , it was felt to be best served by goingback to rehab.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: His discharged medications are asfollows:1. Tylenol 650 mg q.4h. p.r.n. pain.2. Aspirin 325 mg daily.3. Colace 100 mg twice daily.4. Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously daily.5. Nexium 40 mg daily.6. Lasix 80 mg in the morning and 40 mg at night which his IOgoals should be about -500 cc of fluid per day.7. Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d.8. Aspart 10 units subcutaneous with meals.9. Aspart sliding scale.9. Glargine 42 units daily.10. Xalatan one drop.11. Lisinopril 15 mg daily.12. Toprol-XL 200 mg daily.13. Niferex 150 mg daily.14. Zocor 40 mg at night.15. Flomax 0.4 mg daily.16. Multivitamin one tablet daily.17. Zinc 220 mg daily.18. Plavix 75 mg po dailyFOLLOW-UP PLAN:The patient is to call his primary care physician , Dr. Lupe Bario and his cardiologist , Dr. Mraw , followingdischarge from rehabilitation. At that time , he should haverepeat echocardiogram to assess his candidacy for an implantablecardiac defibrillator.eScription document: 6-5034970 EMSSten TelDictated By: DALENBERG , ALEXAttending: REICHMANN , TERRELLDictation ID 1908962D: 4/30/06T: 4/30/06

Her primary cardiologist is Dr.PegramHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Flora is a 50-year-old womanwith coronary artery disease and extensive vascular disease whopresented to the ED with worsening chest pain at rest and atbaseline has exertional chest pain. She had been experiencingincreasing chest pain of late and was referred to CT surgery forsurgical evaluation to correct her CAD and ischemia. She hadbeen at an office visit on the date of admission with Dr. Rudiciland began to experience terrible chest pain and Dr. Nackereferred her to the Clare Taho Medical Center ED for an urgentevaluation. In the ED , she was noted to be afebrile with atemperature of 98 , blood pressure 91/54 , respirations 16 , andsatting 98% on 2 liters. She was noted on EKG to be in normalsinus rhythm with 2-mm ST depressions in II , III , and aVF V4through V6. She was given aspirin , morphine , metoprolol ,Mucomyst , Ativan , nitroglycerin and was made pain-free and wassent to the cath lab for the concern that her stent to thediagonal #1 placed 6/21/04 was no longer patent , as a cause forher unstable angina. She had been recently told that no furtherintervention was possible after her stent to the diagonal #1.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery diseasestatus post CABG in 1996 , which involved LIMA to LAD ( free ) andSVG to OM1. Peripheral vascular disease. Status post FEM-POP andfem-fem bypass in 2003. End-stage renal disease status postcadaveric renal transplant in 1987 , currently immunosuppressed.IDDM , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , retinopathy , TIA , lower GIbleed , chronic diarrhea , CMV colitis , anemia , and bladder CA ,recent diagnosis not yet worked up.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg , azathioprine 50 mg aday , calcium carbonate 650 mg b.i.d. , Colace 150 mg b.i.d. ,lispro sliding scale , Lantus , multivitamin , folate , Lopressor 25mg t.i.d. , prednisone 5 mg a day , Zocor 80 mg q.h.s. , Plavix 75mg q. day as well as Zetia 10 mg a day.ALLERGIES: Sulfa , Benadryl , penicillin , and Compazine.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her husband and has two children.HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , Ms. Ameling was taken to thecardiac catheterization suite where it was found that hercircumflex was 60% , which had been 60% stenosis , now 100%stenosed. Her diagonal #1 status post stent was now 100%stenosed and all other native disease and graft disease wasunchanged. Her right heart cath revealed elevated fillingpressures and PTCA and stent was carried out of the occludeddiagonal #1 stent as well as the LAD , but she became hypotensive ,bradycardic , and developed cardiogenic shock requiring CPR andintubation. She had an IBP placed and subsequently an echo wasdone to rule out effusion and was negative , but had an apparentlylow EF. She had suspected transient decrease in flow to herseptal arteries and this likely compounded her acute myocardialinfarction. Following insertion of the intraaortic balloon pump ,it was noted that she had absent pulses in her right foot , whichwas noted also to be cool to touch. She was transferred to theCCU , intubated and sedated , unresponsive.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her JVP was elevated. Her lungs hadcoarse breath sounds anterolaterally , but without crackles orwheezes. Her heart was regular , tachycardic with a gallop and a3/6 harsh systolic murmur at the base of her heart and a 2/6holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. She had somewhatdecreased bowel sounds , but her belly was soft and nondistended.Her bilateral lower extremities were cool with absent pulses inher feet to palpation and her right foot was mottled and wasnotably cooler without edema.LABORATORY DATA: Her CK was over 100 , MB 7 , troponin 0.92 , INR0.9 , and platelets 191 , 000. She later developed acute renalfailure and dialysis was initiated on Monday , Wednesday , andFriday schedule. Her echo showed an EF of 30% with severe MR aswell as inferoseptal and inferior akinesis. The balloon pump waseventually taken out , the dopamine drip was discontinued. Shewas stabilized and extubated. She was stable for several days ,but on 9/1/04 in the evening experienced an episode of unstableVT arrest requiring shock x 1. no further defibrillation wasneeded. She stabilized after her V-TACH arrest and shocking andper Electrophysiology Service , she was loaded with amiodarone andhas been continued on 200 mg p.o. q.6h. after being titrated offher amiodarone drip.BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular:a. Ischemia: Ms. Quigg has terrible coronary artery diseaseand no further intervention can be offered to her afterdiscussion with both Dr. Kohler 's Surgical team and the EPService. She should not undergo any further catheterizations orrevascularization. She is currently on Aspirin , Plavix ,Lopressor , and Zocor. She was briefly on Lipitor , but this wasdiscontinued after a bump in her LFTs. She is not on an ACE oran ARB secondary to her acute renal failure and at the time ofthis dictation her renal function remains poor and there are noplans to restart an ACE inhibitor or ARB.b. Pump: Ms. Livernoche has ischemic cardiomyopathy with severeMR and she is undergoing ultrafiltration and regularly is gettingseveral liters per hemodialysis session as her blood pressuretolerates.c. Rhythm: Ms. Mcelhiney had an episode of ischemic and unstableventricular tachycardia requiring shocking. Electrophysiologyevaluated her for the possibility of an AICD placement , but thishas been deferred for now and it is unlikely that she will everhave an AICD placed , certainly not on this hospitalization. Shehas been loaded with amiodarone and is currently on 800 mg a day ,split into 200 mg q.6h. p.o. and after 10 days she should bechanged to 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. This will take place on February She initially tolerated amiodarone very poorly secondaryto nausea , so her dose was titrated up gradually.c. Peripheral vascular disease: Ms. Fassett has extensiveperipheral vascular disease and Vascular Surgery is following herfor a likely compartment syndrome in her right calf secondary toischemia upon insertion of intraaortic balloon pump. She ishaving the circumferences of her cath measured once or twice aday and these have not been increasing , have in fact beendecreasing. Also , her creatinine kinase levels have beenfollowed as a surrogate for compartment syndrome and these havebeen decreasing and are currently normal. At the time of thisdictation , her CK was 75 down from the 10 , 000 range. She was onheparin for some time and although her cath continues to betender , the pain has improved and the function has graduallyreturned. Her pulses remained poor. She had lower extremitynoninvasive Dopplers to evaluate her arterial venous flow and noclot was noted in the venous circulation. There was no commentmade on the FEM-FEM graft , however , but no note was made of anarterial clot. She should have the circumferences of her rightcalf followed closely at the place that they are marked on theright lower extremity.2. Renal: Ms. Barrete has acute on chronic renal failure. Shewas admitted with a creatinine of 2.7 and her creatinine has beenup and down depending on the timing of her dialysis; however , sheis relatively anuric , but occasionally produces small volumes ofurine and this should be followed carefully as well. She iscontinuing on prednisone and azathioprine for her transplant andshe did have one positive UA , but this is not being treatedbecause it is difficult to assess secondary to her extremelyconcentrated urine , but should be followed if she does produceurine. This may be permanent , but it is not clear at this pointshe may be on hemodialysis indefinitely. She is on fluidrestriction per renal recommendations of 1000 cc per day intakeand her ARB is being held for now.3. ID: Ms. Helmy spiked on 11/5/04 to 101.8 and she hasbeen found to have a line infection with a positive triple-lumencatheter tip as well as positive blood cultures. She was startedon vancomycin on 4/7/04 and this is being dosed according toher vancomycin troughs , which are drawn once a day. If hertrough is near or below 15 she should be given one dose ofvancomycin and this has turned out to be approximately everyother day.4. Heme: Ms. Kornn 's platelets have been dropping from the100s to the mid 50s since she was started on amiodarone. It isnot clear what the source is. She has had two negative HITantibodies , platelet factor IV antibodies , and her plateletsseemed to have stabilized in the high 40s , mid 50s and she is notshowing any signs of acute bleed , but this has been communicatedwith Electrophysiology Service who is aware of the possibilitythat amiodarone may be causing her thrombocytopenia and theamiodarone has been continued unless her thrombocytopenia worsenssignificantly. She is also on a number of other medications thatmay cause thrombocytopenia and these will be followed as well ,however , it was only the amiodarone for which the timing wascoincident with the drop in her platelets.5. Pulmonary: Ms. Wenrich has a large right pleural effusion;it was tapped on 10/14/04 , 600 cc were removed. It was noted tobe transudative. The tap was complicated by the patient slippingoff her bed during the procedure. She was caught and did notfall , but the pleural effusion was not completely drained and shedeveloped a small hydropneumothorax. This should be followed.She also had a CT subsequently to rule out hemothorax and therewas no evidence of that. The pleural effusion is evident on herchest x-rays with underlying consolidation. There has been nocompromise , however , in her apparent pulmonary status and thisshould be followed since it will likely reaccumulate aftertapping , but if she becomes more symptomatic it should be tapped.6. Ms. Delperdang is on prednisone. For her diabetes , she is onNPH and an insulin sliding scale.7. She experienced an increase in her LFTs , her transaminasesbumped to several 100s , and her total bilirubin peaked at 1.8 ,her alkaline phosphatase also bumped , however , this may have beensecondary to the starting Lipitor and this was discontinued.They have trended down since then. It is not clear exactly thesource of her increase in LFTs. She has been restarted on Zocorat a very low dose at 10 mg and this should be titrated up as herLFTs tolerate. She was on Zocor as an outpatient and we hopethat this is not a class effect and that it is not going to berelated to the dose of her Zocor.8. GI: Her nausea should be treated with p.r.n. Ativan andZofran. She has a Compazine allergy.9. Code status: Ms. Cubeta is DNR/DNI , but family does desirethat if they may help that pressures in shock can be used.eScription document: 7-5712077 ISSten TelDictated By: KESSANS , WILLIAMSAttending: DUBARD , BROCKDictation ID 6382117D: 6/28/04T: 6/28/04

The patient is a 48 year oldmale with new-onset angina and a positive exercise tolerance test ,admitted at this time for elective cardiac catheterization. Thepatient first noted chest tightness while walking in the cold 4months ago. He subsequently had a positive exercise tolerance testat a very short period of time. The thallium test showedreperfusion in the anteroseptal and apex areas. The cardiaccatheterization this admission showed 50% proximal circumflex , 70%obtuse marginal branch #2 , mid right coronary artery subtotalocclusion , and 80% left anterior descending. He had hypokineticleft ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%.ALLERGIES are no known drug allergies. PAST MEDICAL HISTORYreveals hypertension and adult-onset diabetes withhypercholesterolism. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were Diabeta 10milligrams by mouth each morning , Vasotec 5 milligrams by mouth perday , atenolol 50 milligrams by mouth twice a day , iron sulfate ,allopurinol , Colace , aspirin and ciprofloxacin 500 twice a daytimes 5 days. The patient is a former smoker.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese male , withexamination otherwise unremarkable , nocardiac abnormalities , lungs were clear.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrolytes were normal preoperatively ,except for sugar in the middle 150'srange.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to surgery on 15 of November ,where he underwent a coronary artery bypassgrafting times 3 with left internal mammary artery to the leftanterior descending , left saphenous vein graft to the marginal andto the posterior descending artery. The patient tolerated theprocedure well. The posterior descending artery graft had to belengthened intraoperatively as it was somewhat tight at the time ofsternum closure. There were no persistent ST changes.Postoperatively the patient did well. He had one event , which wasfelt to be vasovagal in nature in which he had an episode of chesttight and shortness of breath with diaphoresis. However , serialenzymes and electrocardiograms were normal. This episode occurredimmediately after the patient had overheard a Code Blue on theintercom , awakening him in the middle of the night. The patientalso had his discharge delayed for approximately 36 hours becauseof a very low-grade temperature , which resolved prior to discharge.He had minimal erythema of the proximal saphenous vein harvestsite , for which he was placed on ciprofloxacin 5 dayspostoperatively in oral form.RU005/6229ISREAL A.

Urinalysiswas negative.DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 62with no signs of acute ischemia.Chest x-ray is clear.HOSPITAL COURSE ( by system ): ( 1 ) Gastrointestinal: The patientwas admitted to the Surgical Servicefor , likely , cholecystis , and managed medically. He was maden.p.o. , and hydrated with intravenous fluids and started on tripleantibiotics including ampicillin , gentamicin , and Flagyl. Thepatient remained afebrile with a normal white blood countthroughout his hospital course on the Surgical Service. However ,his alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin became elevated andthe Gastroenterology Medical Service was consulted forconsideration of ERCP. The patient then underwent ERCP on March , 1999 , where a distal common bile duct stone was noted , and anattempt at removal of the stone was made. However , the stone couldnot be extracted. Therefore , the procedure was aborted , and thepatient was transferred to the Medical Service for furthermanagement. The patient's liver function tests remained stableafter the attempt of the common bile duct stone removal , and hecontinued to remain pain free and afebrile. Given the observationof a common bile duct stone , the GI Service thought it appropriateto take the patient back for repeat ERCP two days later. RepeatERCP showed that there was no residual stone , and no additionalstones were noted. The patient was then advanced on hisdiet , which he tolerated with no further symptoms. The patientcontinued to be followed by the Surgical Service who recommended ,then , an elective cholecystectomy as an outpatient at a later date.( 2 ) Cardiovascular: Given the patient's history of coronary arterydisease , a cardiology consult was obtained by the Surgical Service ,who then continued to follow the patient once he was transferred tothe Medical Service. Preoperative evaluation for possiblecholecystectomy was performed , and it was noted that the patient'scoronary artery disease included the following history: Thepatient had a coronary catheterization in 1995 , which revealed a 30percent left anterior descending artery , proximal as well as midstenosis , as well clean circumflex , 70 to 90 percent obtusemarginal lesion , and a 40 percent , 40 percent , and 70 percentserial right coronary artery lesions , as well as a 70 percentposterior descending artery lesion. At that time , obtuse marginalangioplasty was performed. An left ventriculogram revealed anejection fraction of 69 percent at the time. In January 1996 , thepatient had an exercise tolerance test , in which the patient wentsix minutes and 30 seconds with 1 millimeter ST depressions , whichwere highly predictive of ischemia , but the patient had nosymptoms , and he refused intervention at that time.The cardiology consult concluded that given the patient's historyof coronary artery disease , a recommendation was made to perform anuclear imaging study to assess the patient's ischemic risk for acholecystectomy. An exercise tolerance test MIBI was performed , inwhich the patient had a good work load. However , moderate tosevere inferoapical ischemia was noted on MIBI images. Given theurgent need for ERCP during this hospital course , catheterizationwas postponed , and the patient remained chest pain free and symptomfree throughout his hospital course from a cardiology perspective.He was continued on medications , which included Lopressor ,lisinopril , and Diltiazem. Persistent hypertension was controlledby increasing the dose of beta blocker with good response. Aspirinwas held secondary to consideration of ERCP and the possibility ofgastrointestinal bleed. Given that the patient remained symptomfree from a cardiac standpoint , cardiology consult decided that thepatient's cardiac catheterization would be deferred until afterthis hospitalization , in light of the possible complications ofadding a TB3A antagonist during percutaneous transluminal coronaryangioplasty in the context of possible ERCP. Therefore , thepatient will be followed up in cardiology for electivecatheterization.( 3 ) Endocrine: The patient's diabetes was well controlled with hisinsulin regimen , which was held while he was n.p.o. , as well as onan insulin sliding scale.( 4 ) Infectious disease: The patient remained afebrile throughouthis hospital course , but was continued on ampicillin , gentamicin ,and Flagly per surgery recommendations.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.( 2 ) NPH insulin subcutaneous 50 unitsq.a.m. ( 3 ) Regular insulin subcutaneous 10 units q.a.m.( 4 ) Lisinopril 40 milligrams p.o. q.d.

PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 73 year old male with ahistory of hypertension , diabetesmellitus , congestive heart failure , who has had multiple previousadmissions to Lourdes Memorial Medical Center with exacerbations ofhis congestive heart failure , most recently 27 of February The patientwas reasonably well until approximately 4-5 weeks ago when heinitially noticed slight worsening of bilateral ankle swelling.This has progressively worsened until the date of admission whenswelling had progressed up to his waist. In the last 2-3 weeks , healso noted slow worsening of his exertional dyspnea. Prior tothis , he was rarely limited by shortness of breath , but does notexert himself much. Recently , however , exercise tolerance hasdecreased to 3 to 50 feet on flat ground. Patient denied shortnessof breath at rest until yesterday evening when he noted slightdyspnea also associated with a vague chest tightness. Patientsubsequently went to bed , slept on his usual two pillows. He wokesuddenly at 4:00 A.M. the morning of admission with severeshortness of breath , chest tightness , and a sensation of generalfatigue. He was unable to get back to sleep because of worsenedorthopnea. His daughter called the EMTs who took the patient tothe Pathhydenoa Ryside Community Hospital Emergency Room. His initial EKG showed arate of 150 and he was loaded with procainamide after no changeafter being treated with IV adenosine. After treatment with O2 ,his chest tightness resolved. He denied nausea , vomiting ,lightheadedness or diaphoresis on presentation. He also deniedpalpitations during the past few weeks , but has noted episodicpalpitations in the past. He denies any previous episodes of chestpain or angina. In addition , he denies syncope and presyncope.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Congestive heart failure/ischemiccardiomyopathy with recent echo of 10/16 withan ejection fraction of 20% with antero and inferior apicalhypokinesis. 2. Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,diagnosed in 1988 , treated with oral agents. 3. Hypertension. 4.Status post varicose vein surgery of the left leg.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.day , digoxin 0.25 mg q.day ,glyburide 2.5 mg q.day , lisinopril 10 mg q.day , Lasix40 mg p.o. b.i.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient is a retired ship engineer , immigratedto the Dayna Sas from Shanpro Owma Street He lives withhis daughter in Li , originally from Monte Terster Go Hesmokes 1/2 pack per day x 48 years , stopped when he moved to theSy Virgs Lihamdale Alcohol - intermittent binge drinking withoutregular heavy consumption.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Heart rate was 120 , blood pressure 90/70 ,without orthostatic change. HEENT showedpupils were equal , round , reactive to light. Extracular movementsintact. Oropharynx was clear. Neck showed JVP above the jaw witha question of A waves. Chest showed decreased breath sounds at thebases bilaterally with bibasilar crackles. Cardiac exam wasregularly irregular S1 , S2 , + S3 and S4 , 2/6 pansystolic murmur tothe apex. Abdominal exam was soft , nontender , nondistended , with apalpable liver edge , nonpulsatile. No splenomegaly. Extremitiesshowed 3+ bilateral pitting edema. Distal pulses were not palpablebilaterally. Femoral pulses 2+ bilaterally. Neurologic exam wasgrossly nonfocal. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonaryvascular redistribution and perivascular cuffing. EKG showedatrial flutter with 2:1 block at a rate of 135 withintraventricular conduction delay with right bundle branch blockpattern , as well as poor R wave progression.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular. After patient had beentreated with procainamide in the emergency room ,he became hypotensive and was subsequently cardioverted. His bloodpressure recovered to his baseline of 90 systolic and he wasstarted on Ace inhibitors. He was also treated with IV Lasix andstarted on heparin. Because of his disproportionate rightventricular failure , he did undergo a VQ scan which was lowprobability.Patient had recurrent episodes of atrial tachycardia and was loadedorally with amiodarone. In addition , he had some short runs ofnonsustained ventricular tachycardia.After aggressive diuresis , the patient was noted to have anincreasing BUN/creatinine. He was started on IV dobutamine on14 of July and was continued on captopril and Isordil. He diuresed wellon dobutamine and was restarted on digoxin. The dobutamine wasweaned to off on 11 of January He was restarted on IV Lasix.On 25 of August , patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed a40% mid LAD lesion , 40% OM , 40% RCA. His pressures showed an RApressure of 10 , RV 50/12 , with a mean PA pressure of 34 , apulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , cardiac output 3.0 , withan index of 1.6 , SVR 1800. It was therefore felt that hiscardiomyopathy which had initially been attributed to ischemicetiology , was likely idiopathic or secondary to alcohol. Thepatient was subsequently transferred to the KH with Swan-Ganzcatheter in place. He was again treated with dobutamine andIsordil and his captopril was titrated upwards. Repeat echo showedan ejection fraction of 20% with an unstable LV thrombus. He wassubsequently restarted on heparin , followed by loading withCoumadin. He was transferred back to the floor on 2 of February andremained hemodynamically stable on captopril , Isordil , amiodarone ,digoxin and aspirin. His Lasix intravenous was converted to p.o.torsemide with good fluid balance.2. Neurology. The patient was noted to complain oflightheadedness , vertigo and ringing in his ears after receivinghis doses of captopril. He underwent noninvasive carotids whichshowed a subtotal occlusion of his right internal carotid artery.He underwent combined cardiac catheterization and carotidangiography on 11 of January Angiography revealed a greater than 90% rightinternal carotid stenosis. Following the procedure , he had atransient 5-10 minute episode of decreased responsiveness anddecreased left hand grip , which resolved completely. On 30 of January ,he underwent right carotid endarterectomy complicated by a smallright neck hematoma which resolved spontaneously. He had nofurther symptoms and was able to tolerate captopril up to 25 mgt.i.d.3. Hematology. The patient was anticoagulated with heparinfollowed by Coumadin as above , for his LV thrombus , with a targetINR of 2.5 to 3.4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Patient's bloodsugars were well controlled on p.o. glyburide.5. Renal. Patient's creatinine on admission was 1.4. Hiscreatinine transiently rose to 2.2 with aggressive diuresis , butfell to 1.4 on discharge.The patient was discharged home with VNA services on 23 of March Hewas stable on discharge. He is to follow up with Dr. Seth Scheirman on 10 of FebruaryDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.day , entericcoated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.625 q.day , Isordil 20 mgp.o. t.i.d. , multivitamin , quinine 325 mg p.o. q.day , torsemide 60mg p.o. q.day , Coumadin.Dictated By: DOUGLAS E.

The patient has long standing obesity with moderate tosevere hypertension which has been fairly well controlled andpoorly controlled diabetes , as well as atypical chest pain andasthma. Over the last four days she has had increased episodes ofrather persistent chest discomfort , shortness of breath. Shegenerally describes it in her anterior chest wall as pressure , butthere is also some sharp qualities as well. The patient has alsonoted increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea without subjectivewheezing and there has been an increase in her orthopnea. Thepatient is unsure of whether her shortness of breath correlateswith her chest pressure. Previous evaluation has included severalnegative exercise tolerance tests , but there was in 1981 anexercise tolerance test with Thallium that showed a fixed anteriorprofusion defect and an EKG has chronic anterolateral Q wave topoor R wave progression. An echo in 1991 showed LVH with noregional wall motion abnormalities. The patient was admitted forrule out MI three months prior to this admission.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Asthma. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetesmellitus. 4. Obesity. 5. Sleep apnea.6. Peptic ulcer disease.ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to Codeine which producesnausea.CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: 1. Diabetes mellitus. 2. Hypertension.3. Family history of CAD. 4. No tobacco.5. No hypercholesterolemia.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1. Hysterectomy vaginally.2. Status post an umbilical hernia repair.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Azmacort , Proventil , Tagamet , Cardizem 300q.day , insulin NPH 40 units q.AM and 55units q.PM. , aspirin , Motrin , Maxide 1 per day , Lisinopril 20 mgp.o. q.day.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile , heart rate 100 ,respiratory rate 20 , blood pressure was140/80 , oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. She was an obeseblack female lying in the bed at 45 degrees with nasal cannula inno acute distress. Her head was normocephalic atraumatic. Pupilswere equal and round to light and accommodation. Her extraocularmovements were full. Cranial nerves were intact. There were nooral lesions. There was minimal jugular venous distention. Chestwas clear. Heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs ,rubs , or gallops. There was no CVA tenderness. There was somechest wall tenderness on the left. The abdomen was obese andnon-tender , with bowel sounds present. There was no cyanosis ,clubbing , or edema. There was no proprioceptive defects.LABORATORY DATA: Laboratories on admission showed her to have apotassium of 3.7 , BUN and creatinine of 11/1.2 ,creatinine kinase of 148 , troponin of 0.0. Chest x-ray was clearwith no evidence of left ventricular failure. EKG showed normalsinus rhythm at 90 with Q waves/poor R wave progression in I , III ,IV , which was no acute change from the most recent EKG.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ruled out for amyocardial infarction with serial CPK , as well asserial troponin , both of which showed 0.0. The patient alsounderwent a VQ scan given her sedentary life style to rule outpulmonary embolus , and in fact it was very low probability. Thepatient at that point was managed by the addition of agastrointestinal regimen of Prilosec and Cisapride as she hadcomplained of some worsening of her chest pressure when she laidback flat and some sour taste in her mouth. The patient reportedthat this combination of medications made her feel somewhat better.The patient finally underwent an exercise tolerance test with MIBI10/1/96. She went 5 minutes and 0 seconds on a Bruce protocol ,stopped secondary to chest pain. Her peak heart rate was 140 ,which is 85% of predicted. Her systolic maximum was 120. Thechest pressure was similar to that on admission and it was somewhatatypical and ill defined. The patient then had MIBI images whichshowed a borderline to minimal anterior reversible defect , but thatwas as said borderline. The patient was deemed suitable fordischarge after conversation with Dr. Dubin of the CardiologyService , and the patient will be following up with her primary caredoctor. The medication changes will be the addition of Prilosecand Cisapride in the place of Axid AND the addition of isordil 10mg po tid.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Proventil 2 puffs inhaler q.i.d. , entericcoated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , NPH 40units q.AM and 55 units subcu q.PM. , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.day ,Maxide 1 tablet p.o. q.day , nitroglycerin 1/150 1 tablet sublingualq.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain , Prilosec 20 mg p.o.q.day , Azmacort 4 puffs inhaler b.i.d. , Cardizem CD 300 mg p.o.q.day , Cisapride 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. , and isordil 10 mg po tid.Dictated By: SHELTON BUEL , M.D. WI50Attending: JAMEY L.

The patient statesthat approximately three weeks prior to admission , she developedincreased lower extremity edema. She also noted increased coughand shortness of breath. Approximately two weeks prior to theadmission , she doubled her Lasix dose without much improvement inher symptoms. About one week prior to the admission , she beganto have abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. She continued tohave cough and shortness of breath at this time. The eveningprior to presentation , she had substernal chest pain , whichradiated to her arm x1 hour. This pain improved after taking twosublingual nitroglycerin tables. She presented to the emergencydepartment the following day complaining of shortness of breathand fatigue.In the emergency department , the patient's vital signs were notedto be heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 94/40 with O2 sat 98%on room air. She was complaining of shortness of breath andfatigue. Her blood pressure subsequently decreased further to77/48. At this time , she was bolused with IV fluids ,approximately 1.5 to 2 liters. Following the fluid bolus , shedeveloped wheezing and was treated with nebulizers. However , shebecame more nauseated and dyspneic and her blood pressurecontinued to fall. Dopamine was started for blood pressuresupport. When she continued to desaturate into the 80% range andshe was subsequently intubated. An echocardiogram at the bedtimeshowed a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25%. Inaddition , her labs returned with an elevated troponin of 4.5.She had a subsequent chest x-ray , which documented pulmonaryedema. She was admitted for flash pulmonary edema and wastransferred directly from the emergency department to the cardiaccath laboratory. In the cath lab , her bypass grafts of the LIMAto the LAD and SVG to OMB were noted to be patent. However , allthe other grafts were occluded. No interventions wereundertaken. She was also noted to have elevated right andleft-sided pressures with right atrial pressure of 32 and a meanpulmonary artery pressure of 51 and a left wedge pressure of 40.She was subsequently transferred to the CCU where she was alsonoted to have a serum creatinine of 2.3 and making very smallamounts of urine. A pH at that time was 7.13. Her cardiacoutput , cardiac index ratios were 6.8 to 3. She was treated withsodium bicarb and Lasix IV drip. Overnight , she developed abrisk diuresis and her hypotension resolved. An echocardiogramobtained on hospital day two showed an estimated ejectionfraction of 45%. The entire inferior wall was noted to beakinetic. The posterior wall was moderately hypokinetic. Globalright ventricular systolic function was severely reduced. Shewas also note to have a thickened , calcified mitral valve withsevere mitral regurgitation.Her CCU course was notable for two positive blood cultures , onedrawn on 2/21/05 and the other drawn on 4/10/05 for which shewas started first on vancomycin and then switched to nafcillinfor Coag-negative staph bacteremia. She was also diagnosed witha UTI and started on levofloxacin. She was eventually extubatedon 11/18/05. She was discharged from the CCU on 10/30/05 , andwas accepted on to the Cards Aworth Service.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Hypertension.2. Hypercholesterolemia.3. Diabetes mellitus.4.

Magnesium gluconate 1 gm three times a day.23. Loratadine 10 mg once a day.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is separated from her husband , andshe has several children who live in the same area. She liveswith her son and grandson in the same house. She is a currentsmoker , approximately one-third pack per day. She denies alcoholand IV drug use.FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a sone with schizophrenia.LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION: CBC showed a white blood cellcount of 6.07 , hematocrit 28.5 , and platelets 274 , 000. INR 2.3.PTT 42.8 and PT 25.8. Sodium 131 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 87 ,bicarb 24 , BUN 30 , INR 2.3 , and glucose 173. ALT ??___?? , AST27 , alkaline phosphatase 66 , and total bili 0.2. CK 141 , MB 8.2 ,troponin peaked at 4.46 and subsequently trended down.HOSPITAL COURSE: Following discharge from the Coronary CareUnit: In summary , the patient is a 64-year-old female , admittedon 2/21/05 , complaining of subacute progressive symptoms of CHFin addition to a more acute onset of nausea and vomiting. Shepresented to the emergency department hypotensive , which wasprobably related to dehydration due to decreased p.o. intake aswell as continued Lasix use. When given IV fluids , she went intoflash pulmonary edema , requiring transfer to the CCU andintubation. The patient underwent emergent cath , which showed nonew intervenable disease , but did show severe MR. She wasadmitted to the CCU where she was aggressively diuresed andweaned of the vent. She was transferred to the floor on4/13/05.Her hospital course by system is as follows.Cardiac ischemia. The patient underwent catheterization on2/21/05 , which showed 100% obstruction in the SVG to RCA graft ,60% obstruction in the RIMA to the marginal 1 graft , patent LIMAto the LAD , and patent SVG to OM1 and OM2. Note was made ofmarkedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures. Nostents were placed. We continued management of her ischemia withaspirin , beta-blocker , Lipitor , and Imdur. In addition , westarted an ACE inhibitor , which had been initially held due toher hypotension. This was restarted on 10/30/05 for afterloadreduction , given her severe mitral regurgitation. Over thecourse of her CCU stay and her hospital stay on the CardiacService , she continued to clinically improve. We felt that hermitral regurgitation was likely dynamic , related to her CHF flareand ischemia. We would recommend outpatient echo for furtherfollow-up of her mitral regurgitation.Rhythm. The patient at baseline has paroxysmal atrialfibrillation , on Coumadin. Here , she was noted to be in normalsinus rhythm. Her Coumadin dose was held for two nights from10/30/05 to 6/5/05 for planned TEE echo and a small dose ofvitamin K was given. Subsequently , the TEE was later canceled.We are therefore restarting the patient on her home dose ofCoumadin , but her INR may rise somewhat slowly due to the vitaminK. We have asked her to have her labs checked on 9/13/05 for anINR check.Infectious disease. The patient was noted to have two positivecultures for Coag-negative staph , one drawn on 2/21/05 and onedrawn on 5/29/05. She was initially started on vancomycin on2/30/05 and then switched to nafcillin based on hersensitivities. The plan was to obtain a TEE to evaluate her forendocarditis. However , on further review of the sensitivity , weconclude that two bottles represent two different Coag-negativestaph species. We feel that this most likely representscontamination rather than true bacteremia. This was discussedwith the ID fellow who agreed with our assessment. Therefore ,the TEE was discontinued and antibiotics were also discontinued.We asked that the patient have surveillance blood cultureschecked on 9/13/05 while off all antibiotics.The patient also had a positive UA while in the CCU and wasstarted on levofloxacin for a UTI. However , her urine culturesnever grew an organism. So , this was discontinued on 6/16/05.Pulmonary. The patient has a history of COPD. She was continuedon her home inhalers as well as nebulizers as needed. Shereceived one course of pulse dose steroids while in the CCU forpresumed COPD infection. This was discontinued prior to heradmission to the floor.Renal. On presentation , the patient had evidence of acute renalfailure with creatinine elevated at 2.3. However , this improvedwith diuresis. She also had an MRI of the kidneys to evaluatefor renal artery stenosis on 6/16/05. This showed severediffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta , but norenal artery stenosis. The radiologist recommends a CT angiogramfor further work if clinically indicated as an outpatient.Endocrine. The patient has a history of diabetes and is onLantus and metformin at home. Here , we held her metformin doseand treated her instead with insulin sliding scale and Lantus.We have asked the patient to restart her metformin upondischarge.FEN. The patient's goal in's and out's should be even to -500 mlper day. We increased her home Lasix dose from 80 mg daily to 80mg in the morning and 40 mg at night. These doses should besubsequently adjusted to maintain her volume status as anoutpatient.Code. Status is full code.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home on 1/7/05 withVNA Services. VNA should assist the patient with her medicationsas well as volume status checks , daily weights , and lung exams.She has a follow-up appointment already scheduled with herprimary care doctor , Dr. Wagenheim , on 9/29/05 at 2:30 p.m. Inaddition , Dr. Rayome of the Cardiology Service will seethe patient as an outpatient. The exact appointment time anddate are pending at the time of this dictation. The office hasindicated that they will call the patient for a specificappointment time.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:1.

She treated this at home with sublingual nitroglycerin withpartial relief of her pain. She presented to the emergency roomand had full resolution of her jaw pain with three sublingualnitroglycerin. Of note , when the patient presented with a non-STelevation MI approximately three months prior , she also had leftjaw pain. Since this pain was the patient's classic anginal pain ,heparin was started despite the fact that she had negative cardiacenzymes and no EKG changes.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,hypertension , hyperlipidemia , coronaryartery disease status post left circumflex stent in April 2002.Anxiety , depression , left arm phlebitis associated with blood drawsafter her left circumflex stent was placed. Status postappendectomy , status post tubal ligation.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS: Glucophage , Lipitor , atenolol , aspirin , sublingualnitroglycerin p.r.n. , Zestril , Celexa , Klonopin ,Neurontin.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a daughter who works for Erdar Y University Hospitals She does not smoke nor does she drinkalcohol. Her primary language is Spanish.FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease. Thepatient's father died of a myocardial infarctionat age 62 and her mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 75.VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 100-137/52-67 , pulse 60-62 ,respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 97-98% on twoliters nasal cannula.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Well appearing middle-aged female.NECK: JVP flat. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regularrate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. CHEST: Clear toauscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended.Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No lower extremity edema ,warm. RECTAL: The patient is guaiac negative.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular. The patient wastaken for cardiac catheterizationafter she was admitted. Her cardiac catheterization was onApril , 2003. Prior to her catheterization she was enrolled inthe Nacan Cajord General Hospital This was a blinded trial with Permsan Madiston Ni Hospital inhibitor. In accordance with the trial , the patient wasstarted on Lovenox 1 mg per kg subcutaneously b.i.d. Later thatafternoon on April , 2003 , she went for cardiac catheterization.The cath revealed a right dominant system with no significant leftmain lesions , no significant left anterior descending lesions , 70%diffuse lesion in the left circumflex artery consistent withinstant restenosis of her previously placed PIXEL stent. The rightcoronary artery showed a 30% lesion. During this catheterization ,brachytherapy to the vessel that showed instant restenosis wasattempted , however , it was aborted due to technical malfunction ofthe brachytherapy delivery machine. The lesion was , however ,dilated by balloon angioplasty. After dilatation there was TIMI-3flow with 10% residual stenosis.Postcath the patient did well. She was maintained on aspirin ,Zocor , Lopressor , captopril , Celexa , Klonopin which are her homemedications. The morning after catheterization , the patient hadrecurrent chest pain which radiated to her right jaw. The pain wasrelieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. The following day , thepatient did well. However , she began to develop a right groinhematoma in the afternoon on July , 2003. The hematoma wasthought to be rapidly enlarging. Hematocrit checked at that timerevealed a significant drop in blood count to 26. The patient wastransfused two units of packed red blood cells. Her hematomacontinue to expand overnight. The patient was discontinued fromLovenox at that time. However , she was continued on aspirin andPlavix. The patient's Lovenox was reversed with protamine.Over the night , the patient's hematoma continued to expand. Shereceived , the following morning on March , 2003 , one unit offresh frozen plasma as well as a third unit of packed red bloodcells. At that point , her hematoma was marked and it was noted tobe stable from that point on , no longer expanding beyond the boundsof the marks. Her left arm was noted at that time to also be tensewith hematoma secondary to blood draws. Vascular surgery wasconsulted in the morning on March , 2003 , in order to assess theright groin hematoma as well as the hematoma in the left arm due toconcern for developing compartment syndrome. Vascular surgery sawthe patient and felt that as long as the patient's hematocritstabilized , she would not need any surgical intervention. Theycould not find any evidence for left upper extremity compartmentsyndrome at that time.Also on the morning of March , 2003 , the patient's plateletsagents including both Plavix and aspirin were discontinued.Further family history was obtained from the patient that day whichrevealed history suspicious for possible bleeding disorderincluding the information that the patient's daughter bleedsheavily with each menstrual period , and that both the patient andher daughter have very easy bruising with history of severalhematomas secondary to light trauma. The patient also reportedthat she had heavy bleeding with childbirth that required extrahospitalization although it did not require a transfusion.Hematology was consulted at that point. The patient was thought byhematology to have these hematomas secondary to overanticoagulation with Lovenox , Plavix , aspirin and possible STONDE MEDICAL CENTERtrial drug with a Kenda Medical Center The only familialcoagulation problems that were screened for based on theirrecommendations were von Willebrand screen as well as a Factor XIIIscreen. The Factor XIII screen eventually turned out normal andthe von Willebrand screen was pending at the time of discharge.By the morning of August , 2003 , the patient had received a totalof five units of packed red blood cells due to blood loss secondaryto this hematoma. Her hematoma had stabilized at that time. Shewas restarted on aspirin on August , 2003. From that pointonward , the patient did quite well and was maintained on aspirin ,beta-blocker , Zocor and ACE inhibitor.The remainder of her hospitalization was uncomplicated and afterthe patient had a stable hematocrit for several days without anyrecurrent jaw pain , she was discharged home on January , 2003.Neurology. On August , 2003 , the patient developed a headachewhich she described as the same as she frequently experiences athome. Her headaches are usually not responsive to Tylenol or otheranalgesics. Given the patient's complications with hematoma andbleeding , a head CT was obtained that afternoon to rule outintracerebral hemorrhage. Her head CT was negative for bleeding.Her headache was treated with Tylenol to which it did not respondand later with Percocet to which she got some relief.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day , Klonopin 0.5 mgt.i.d. , glucophage 500 mg b.i.d. , Celexa40 mg p.o. q.d. , Zestril 2.5 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. ,Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.FOLLOW UP: The patient was instructed to follow up with herprimary care physician , Dr. BazerDictated By: LUKE DRENTLAW , M.D. SN01Attending: MARK WILKES , M.D. JO16LY565/943229Batch: 71748 Index No. NNAJ9W4537 D: 5/5/03T: 5/5/03

His neuroexam demonstrated he is alert and oriented x3.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. The patient was in end-stage renal disease and had a livingunrelated renal transplant from his friend. A detaileddescription of the procedure can be found in his dictatedoperative report. There were no complications. His kidney hadgood urine output during his postoperative course. Hiscreatinine continued to trend down even on his days of discharge.His creatinine was within a normal range prior to his discharge.He had some volume overload secondary to the large amount of IVfluids that he received , however , after minimal diuresis heresponded with high urine outputs. His immunosuppressionincluded Thymoglobulin , tacrolimus , a steroid taper , andCellCept. His allograft was functioning well.2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was found to be in atrialfibrillation postoperatively. He was evaluated by the CardiologyService. They interrogated his pacer and found that he was infact in atrial fibrillation. After 48 hours , the CardiologyService considered anticoagulation. Because he had a history ofa GI bleed , it was decided that he would not undergoanticoagulation. The patient's heart rate throughout this periodwas within the normal range because he was V-paced.3.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter left sided , statuspost atrial fibrillation ablation attempt x1 , and atrial flutterablation x4 , transesophageal echo in 6/24 showed that atrialappendage thrombus and trace mitral regurgitation.2. Hyperprolactinemia.3. Hypercholesterolemia.4. Chest CT in 9/19 showed multiple tiny nodules in the rightupper lobe that needed to be followed up in 6-12 months.BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-oldmale with a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation and atrialflutter , status post multiple cardioversion and failed ablations ,admitted electively for repeat ablation of his atrial flutter.He was initially diagnosed with atrial fibrillation about 12years ago and had multiple failed cardioversion and medicationtrials. He underwent several atrial fibrillation ablations ,which ultimately all failed. Overtime his atrial fibrillationhas become atrial flutter possibly due to scarring of the atrialwall and repeated ablations. When he was first diagnosed withatrial fibrillation he was started on Coumadin , but that gave himskin necrosis around his right scapular region. He had been allthe anticoagulants until 6/24 when during transesophageal echofor planned ablation he was found to have a left atrial appendageclot. He was first started on Lovenox , which caused largeecchymosis , which prompted him to switch anticoagulation thefondaparinux. He now lived persistently in atrial flutter. Hisweight controlled with acebutolol. His physical activity hassomewhat decreased and he occasionally gets short of breath ,epigastric discomfort , and palpitations. He was admitted on7/6/06 for planned atrial flutter ablation by Dr. Bockemehl andDr. Caddle However , a preprocedure transesophageal echoagain demonstrated a left atrial appendage thrombus despite beingon fondaparinux , instead the patient underwent permanent atrialfibrillation and atrial flutter surgery , which included a fourthsternotomy and ablation of atrial fibrillation with COX III Mazewith cryoablation and cut and sew resection of the left and rightatrial appendages and closure of a patent foramen ovale.PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Included Lipitor 40 mg orally daily ,acebutolol 200 mg orally daily , bromocriptine 7.5 mg orallydaily , and fondaparinux 10 mg subcutaneously daily.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has no tobacco use , no alcoholabuse , and no illicit drug use.ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to quinidine , Coumadin towhich he has a skin necrosis allergy , flecainide which he hasquestionable syncope , and amiodarone in which he developedabnormal liver function test.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient was alert and oriented x3.He was in no acute distress.

This patient wasscheduled to have cystoscopy and bladder intervention for a possiblebladder cancer as well as TURP at Whee Hospital on 2/1/2006. Hissurgeon wanted a pre-surgical cardiac evaluation given this history ofAS. The patient has had not changes in his functional activity recently.Of note , his past history is notable for 5/23 with a right hemisphericischemic stroke. He has been having a gradual recovery: there is nosensitivity in the left leg , though the motor deficits have improved andhe is able to walk with a walker. When he really exerts himself , he hadepisodes of SOB but no chest pain , palpitations , presyncope or syncope.He does have an unclear history of orthopnea but it might not be of acardiac etiology.

No comparison EKG for baseline so unable to ascertain if newischemia or if ACS in setting of sx. Patient rec'd ASA , nitro x3 w/relief and 2 mg morphine in ED. CXR was performed showing bilateraleffusions w/ L>R. Enzyme set A was negative. Patient was admitted tofloor , where a repeat EKG was done , which showed changes from his priorEKG , specifically a new T wave inversion in V3 and trigeminy with PVCs.Patient reported mild pain at this time. Signs & symptoms wereconcerning enough for ACS that the patient was started on a heparin dripof 1000cc/hr with a loading bolus of 5000 units and his PTT followed.Home isosorbide was held to ascertain for pain. Records were requestedfrom Wickstra Hospital , where the patient had his surgery 1 month ago.Patient was put on telemetry and his home Lipitor was increased to 80mg , and his home lopressor was increased to 37.5 mg TID. Overnight he waspain free , and r/o'd by enzymes x 3. His telemetry showed NSR w/occasional trigeminy and PVCs. Pain may be incisional or anginal ,lightheadedness most likely patient's anginal equivalent. Cardiology wasconsulted to consider the indications for catheterization and risk of ACS.The patient was asx 10/3 and noted to have some sternal incisional painwith palpation , no EKG changes observed. Reccomendations were made to sendthe patient to ETT-MIBI 4/12 , check fasting am lipids , d/c home amiodaronefrom RH for his ? arrythmia. The patient was also started on Lisinopril5mg at this time and his heparin drip was d/c'd. ETT-MIBI showed no signsof reversible ischemia , basal wall hypokinesis but which was knwon onadmission. Fasting cholesterol was unable to be sent 2/2 to am MIBIschedule. Should be tested as outpatient.( P ): No signs of pump dysfunction though mildly elevated jvp of 6-8cm onadmission , EF post-CABG at LMVH was 43%. Repeat echo was ordered to assessfunction though cancelled in setting of unremarkable MIBI and absence of ofsx and signs failure while in house.( R ): Alternates between NSR and trigeminy with PVCs. Amiodarone from THd/c's as not needed for this rhythym.--Renal: h/o hematuria at MMH , microhematuria on U/A and urine sed onadmission. Will require outpatient follow up. Per LAH noted he would needrenal bx and follow-up though it does not seem appropriate w/ h/o foley andhematuria. Cystoscopy seems more relevant. We consulted the patient's PCPand agree to recommend outpatient urology follow-up over renal. Urinecytology was ordered and collected ( though some lost to collection duringMIBI ).

Shealso was subsequently started on Zaroxolyn two days prior toadmission. She has felt increasingly tired and light headedwithout dyspnea. She has had a very dry mouth. She has also noteda decline in urine output. She is admitted to the short stay uniton May , 2000 when her BUN and creatinine were 125 and 4.2respectively. This compared to a baseline creatinine of about 2.0.She was admitted for intravenous hydration. She continues tocomplain of dizziness when she sits up at the time of admission andher creatinine has declined from 4.6 to 2.1 off all her medicationsand with some mild hydration over the first two days of admission.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Diabetes mellitus. 2 ) Gastroesophagealreflux disease. 3 ) Gout. 4 ) Congestiveheart failure secondary diastolic dysfunction. 5 ) Diverticulosisin 1998. 6 ) Obstructive sleep apnea. 7 ) Hypertension. 8 )Chronic renal insufficiency , baseline creatinine of about 2.0. 9 )Anemia of chronic disease.ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Morphine.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married. She has five children andtwo foster children. She quit smoking around nineyears ago. She uses a cane with walking.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission wassignificant for chest examination which wasclear. Cardiac examination was muffled , but you could hear an S4 ,S1 and S2 with a jugular venous pressure around 7 cm , positivehepatojugular reflux , 1+ peripheral edema of both legs.Extremities were warm and well perfused. Abdomen is obese andsoft. There was no cyanosis or clubbing in the extremities.LABORATORY: EKG showed a left ventricular hypertrophy , firstdegree atrioventricular block with a heart rate around90.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was initially admitted to the shortstay unit and was given fluid for two days andall of her medications were held. She was admitted to theCardiology Service , however on April , 2000 , she had been inhousewith that being her fourth day. Her cardiac medications wereprogressively re-initiated and her Imdur was increased to 120 mgp.o. b.i.d. Her course is notable for progressive decline in herBUN and creatinine. On April , 2000 we restarted her Lisinopril at10 mg b.i.d. She came in on 20 mg b.i.d. She did fine with this.The next , however we restarted her Torsemide and increased her doseof Lisinopril. This resulted in a bump of her BUN and creatinineback up to around 2.8 from 1.9. Because she diuresed a total ofabout 300 cc that day , we presumed this bump was due to increasedose of Lisinopril. We decreased the dose back to 10 mg b.i.d. andcontinued her Torsemide. The patient's BUN and creatininestabilized then at 63 and 2.8. Because of this response toLisinopril , we performed a renal artery scan with results pendingat the time of this dictation. The patient also at the time ofdischarge clearly at her driest considering the medication regimenthat she is on. She is clearly orthostatic this morning. She willbe discharged on 100 mg p.o.

DKA: The patient was stabilized in the MICU on an insulindrip and was then transferred to General Medicine for furthermanagement. Causes of DKA that were ruled out included thefollowing - negative cardiac enzymes , unimpressive pancreaticenzymes , unimpressive lactate , normal LFTs. The patient's DKAwas presumed to be due to her right thigh cellulitis in thesetting of a local burn. She initially was given 500 mL normalsaline boluses and then several 250 mL boluses. As she isaneuric , her boluses were stopped once the blood sugars werebelow 500. She initially was placed on insulin drip that wasthen transitioned to NPH and finally to Lantus 24 units subcudaily. Of note , the patient intermittently refused to take bothher long-acting and her insulin sliding scale. As a result , anendocrinology consult was called. The patient was noted to beordering extra food from the kitchen , which could in part explainher labile sugars. Despite careful diet and glucose controlefforts , the patient still had sugars at times to the 500s.Endocrinology continues to leave recommendations about ACstanding insulin in addition to her NovoLog sliding scale andLantus insulin. The patient has a history of gastroparesis andtherefore may not tolerate AC insulin very well. The patient'snew covering team will continue to follow up with Endocrinology.2. Right thigh cellulitis: The patient was placed on Augmentinand IV vancomycin. Her area of cellulitis has completelyresolved at the present time with slight sloughing of theoverlying skin. The underlying skin is pink with evidence ofgood granulation and no further evidence of infection. Giventhat her IV access is very difficult , the patient received somevancomycin , as she finishes hemodialysis every other day.3. End-stage renal disease: The patient missed her dialysis onthe day of admission. Once in the hospital , her potassium wasvery difficult to control in part due to poor adherence with herrenal diet and in part due to her very labile sugars. At times ,her potassium would rapidly increase to a level higher than 6.5requiring urgent dialysis. At the present time , the patient hasbeen dialyzed daily since her admission. She is closely followedby renal with plans to continue dialysis while in the hospital.She should not receive any further intravenous fluids unless shehas evidence of recurrent DKA , given her anuric state. Shouldshe become acidotic , the patient can be managed with sodiumbicarbonate and D5W in small boluses.4. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , there was no evidence of chestpain. The patient has showed no EKG signs of ischemia. Hercardiac enzymes remained negative. Lipids are pending at thepresent time. Lipid profile check is pending at the presenttime. Pump , the patient has a history of CHF with evidence ofright heart failure likely due to valvular disease in some aspectof the diastolic dysfunction given her preserved ejectionfraction. Her weight on admission was 70 kg. We did not knowher dry weight. Dialysis is helping to manage her fluids givenher aneuric status. Her O2 sats remained stable on room airthroughout the hospitalization. Her hypertension has beensomewhat poorly controlled and for that reason she was continuedon her home dose of Lopressor 25 q.i.d. and switched toCaptopril , which we continued to titrate at the present time.Rhythm , normal sinus rhythm. The patient is currently ontelemetry with no signs of arrhythmia.5. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: The patient was placed on acardiac , renal and diabetic diet. She was noted to repeatedlyorder extra food from the kitchen supervisor. Nutritionendocrinology and nursing staff are all aware and are workingdiligently to prevent the patient from receiving more than 2000calories per day as specified by her ADA diet. She is continuingher Nephrocaps and sevelamer. Prophylaxis , heparin 5000 unitssubcu t.i.d. - the patient has consistently refused her heparin.6. Consent: All interventions require consent from thepatient's medical guardian , Stanley Paneque ( please see numberabove ).7. Code status: The patient is full code and this has beenconfirmed with the guardian.ADDENDUMOf note , on the night of 10/22/06 , the patient complained ofsevere cramping , right lower quadrant pain , which is new. Shenoted this pain has increased rapidly in the setting of diarrhea.Several C. diff studies , which were sent recently have beennegative and the patient has had no blood in her diarrhea.Presumed cause is Augmentin , which has been stopped. The patienthas continued to eat freely and is passing diarrhea despite hercomplaints of 10/10 severe abdominal pain. A CT scan of herabdomen was ordered , but she refused to take oral or IV contrast.The results of this CT scan are pending and will be followed upby the new medical team.eScription document: 2-6789802 CSSten TelDictated By: TARONE , ANTONIAAttending: JAME CHATTERTON , M.D. HF91Dictation ID 5809901D: 5/17/06T: 5/17/06

The following is a continuation of thehospital events during her stay.1. Low back pain: As stated before , she suffers fromdebilitating low back pain from morbid obesity , spinal stenosis ,rheumatoid arthritis , and degenerative joint disease. During herhospitalization , her pain was treated with narcotics as well as asteroid/analgesic epidural injection. The Pain Service followedduring her discharge day. Her pain control with narcotics wastitrated with a fentanyl patch along with breakthrough p.o.Dilaudid. She was also titrated up on her chronic painmedications including Neurontin and Elavil. The patient had ahistory of sedation with too much narcotics , and her narcoticsshould be titrated for mental status changes. During her stay ,she received IV conscious sedation MRI , which showed a normalspinal cord and spinal stenosis , facet involvement. Orthopedicssurgery was consulted early during the hospitalization and theydetermined that there was no surgical indication for orthopedicsurgery. They were also reconsulted later on when the patientappeared to want to have surgery , and at that time orthopedicssurgery determined that the risk-benefit ratio was not in favor ,and that she was not a surgical candidate in the context of anewly developed right lower extremity DVT. As mentioned before ,the patient had an epidural injection with bupivacaine andsteroids on 7/8/05 with minimal initial response to her pain.However , later , there was some improvement in her pain. Thepatient is to follow at the Pain Clinic in two weeks , as furtherappointments in the follow up section for a possible repeatepidural injection. In addition , she is to follow up with Dr.Farella within four weeks of the Orthopedics Surgery Service forreevaluation for the orthopedics surgery. In addition , shereceived aggressive physical therapy , which slowly enabled her toimprove her range of movement in her lower extremities. She doeshave chronic and stable left lower extremity immobility.However , she is able to move her right leg somewhat and this hasimproved slowly over time with aggressive PT. The patient hasvery agreeable of recent days to physical therapy and is expectedto continue to improve with continued aggressive physicaltherapy. This should be the mainstay of her treatment inaddition to her pain control with her medications. She should bepremedicated with Dilaudid or any pain control medications priorto any physical therapy session.2. Cardiovascular: The patient had stable cardiovascularparameters during her admission and did not require anysignificant changes in her outpatient medications. Medicationsare as listed in the discharge medications.3. Endocrine: She has severe diabetes mellitus and insulinresistence. Her NPH was titrated due to episodes of asymptomatichypoglycemia to the range of 45 to 55 in the fasting morningglucoses of normal need. On discharge , the patient wasmaintained on NPH insulin b.i.d. as well as sliding scale ofregular insulin. He also had a history of hypothyroidism and herSynthroid was continued. She had a history of renalinsufficiency and received a chronic low dose of prednisone. Shedid not have any issues while she was in the hospital.4. Rheumatology: The patient has rheumatoid arthritis. Herprednisone was decreased in duration of her stay from prednisone20 mg p.o. q.a.m. to 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. She also is on as anoutpatient on her home dose of methotrexate 20 mg p.o. q. week ,which was held during her hospitalization due to her acuteissues. However , the methotrexate , which was prescribed by heroutpatient rheumatology , should be restarted as an outpatient assoon as possible. She takes 20 mg p.o. q. week.5. Renal: Initially , the patient had a mild increase in hercreatinine on presentation , but this improved to the normal rangewith gentle hydration.6. Infectious disease: The patient had a fever on 4/22/04 to101 and on 6/26/05 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Cultures werenegative. There were white blood cells in her urine and she wasempirically given levofloxacin. She did have cough and sputum ,and she was found to have MRSA in her sputum and was known to becolonized at this point , and was placed on precautions. However ,her chest x-ray was clear. She did not have a clinicalpneumonia. Her lower extremity appeared red and woody and therewas question of cellulitis , and she received 10 days of p.o.Keflex , although it was unlikely she had two cellulitis.7. Pulmonary: She likely has obstructive sleep apnea with amild decrease in O2 saturations at night. However , this wasnever clinically significant. Her body habitus and symptoms wereconsistent with obstructive sleep apnea. Chest x-rays were alsotaken during her course and were unchanged from her prior.Although , she has had a history of being fitted for a C-PAP mask ,she refused to use this.8. Hematology: She was diagnosed with a DVT in her right leg byultrasound on 6/26/05 , and was started on a heparin drip , whichwas bridged to warfarin with therapeutic INR during the rest ofher stay. The plan is for her to continue six months ofanticoagulation , then reevaluation by her outpatient primary carephysician. Her current dose of Coumadin is 6 mg p.o. q.h.s. andthis should be checked one week after discharge from the hospitalin order to ensure a goal INR of 2 to 3. Until than she will bemaintained on Lovenox 40 mg subu q.d. in the hospital , and thiscan be continued as needed as an outpatient.9. Physical therapy: As per above , the patient is engaged inphysical therapy and showed improvement over time.10. GI: The patient has intermittent constipation to her painmedications and has poor p.o. intake in general , however , thisimproved over the course of admission. She requires anaggressive bowel regimen to keep her regular bowel movements andshe will be often resonant to have a bowel movement due to thefeeling of vertigo during the bowel movements. This , however ,improved during time. She should be encouraged to allow herselfto have bowel movement in the rest room if she is able. The goalwill be for her to be able to sit on a toilet potty at thebedside.11. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient hadintermittent , non-clinically significant hyperkalemia , whichinitially was corrected with Kayexalate and bowel movements.12. Psychiatric: The patient had intermittent vocalization ofnot caring if she lived or died because she had lived her lifeand she was in pain. She was seen by the psychiatry multipletimes. She did not think that she was suicidal and only needemotional support to which she responded well. At the time ofdischarge , she was euthymic and hopeful and was eager to continueto improve her quality of life with aggressive physical therapyand pain control. She was looking forward to continuing her paincontrol management follow up visit with pain service.13. The patient has declared herself to be DNR/DNI.TO-DO PLAN , FOLLOW-UP PLAN:1. Aggressive physical therapy and pain control , as directed bythe pain clinic and her primary care physician.2. After her discharge from rehabilitation , she should follow upwith her rheumatologist Dr. Boughamer , pain clinic , Dr. Cills ,which is her primary care physician in Orthopedics.3. She is also noted to be MRSA colonized and should be onappropriate precautions. She should continue her Coumadin forsix months for her deep vein thrombosis until otherwise directedby the physician. The pain clinic will consider additionaltherapy for pain including epidural repeat as an outpatient. Thepatient should restart her methotrexate as an outpatient.FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:At this time , she has an appointment with Dr. Boore at theNardon Hospital Pain Clinic at Mont Ox Delp , phone number286-351-0157 on 7/9/05 at 2:30 p.m. She also has anappointment with Dr. Christofferse , Orthopedic Surgery at the Middrise Et Brynta Hospital Orthopedic Service on the Jo Renford PuGlenda Li Sabuffta at Park Health , phone number967-787-5406 on 10/1/05 at 10:30 a.m. She should have her INRdrawn in one week after discharge and follow up INR is to bedrawn every seven days until therapeutic.

The patient is a 70 yearold female admitted with approximately 12 hours of chest pain. Sheruled in for a myocardial infarction with a CPK peak of 786 and MBfraction of 52. Her echocardiogram examination was within normallimits with left ventricular function that was normal. She did ,however , have inferior posterior hypokinesis. Her ejectionfraction was 55%. The patient was on IV Heparin , Aspirin andNitropaste as well as a beta blocker. She had no symptoms of chestpain or shortness of breath. She had exercise tolerance test whichwas done approximately 5 to 6 days after her myocardial infarction.She underwent a modified Bruce protocol for 8 minutes and 40seconds with chest pain and ST changes. She had 1 minute of leftbundle branch block at the end of her exercise test. The patient'sexercise test was also notable for her having typical chest painsimilar to her angina. She had up to 2 mm ST depressions. Thetest was highly predictive of significant coronary disease. Thisexercise test was done on March . The patient went to cardiaccatheterization on May .

The patientwas noted to be pale and diaphoretic at this time. The patienthad recently noticed an increase in her baseline , severe dyspneaon exertion , there was no loss of consciousness , trauma , orprodrome associated with this mechanical fall. The patientdenied chest pain on admission to OH . She had left shoulderpain and complained of right scapular pain in the emergency room.The patient had been recently discharged from FGH afteradmission for herniated disc at L2 and L3 with right nerve rootimpingement. In the emergency room , the chest x-ray wasremarkable for a left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient also hadan elevated troponin at 0.19. The EKG in the emergency roomshowed 0.5 mm increase in ST depressions in the inferolateralleads , which the patient had at baseline.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. IDDM.2. CAD.3. Hyperlipidemia.4.

Neuro ,alert and oriented x3 , no focal deficits.Labs on admission were significant for white blood cell countequal to 12 with 25% bands and 56% polys , troponin on admission0.19.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. ID: The patient's decreased O2 saturation , chest x-rayfindings were all consistent with a left lower lobe pneumonia.The patient was started on Levaquin for a seven-day course. Thepatient's Levaquin was discontinued on 1/25/04 after a chest CTshowed no evidence of any further infiltrate in the left lowerlobe. The patient was able to be weaned off of oxygen and wassaturating in the high 90% at the time of discharge. The patientalso underwent urine , blood , and sputum cultures during thisadmission , which showed no growth of any organism.2. Pulmonary: The patient had a history of left upper lobe lungcancer status post resection. The patient was continued on herFlovent for management of likely COPD. She underwent a chest CTduring this admission , which showed no evidence a mass orrecurrence of her lung cancer.3. Ischemia: The patient was found to have a troponin as highas 23 during this admission and ruled in for a non-NSTEMI in thesetting of hypoxemia. The patient was continued on aspirin ,statin beta-blocker and Ace inhibitor. She underwent adobutamine MIBI on 5/18/05 , which showed areas of periinfarctischemia most prominent at the anterior wall. The patient thenunderwent a cardiac catheterization on 11/29/05 , which showedleft main disease at 50% as well as tight left circumferentialLAD and a 100% RCA lesion. The patient was then evaluated forCABG in light of her three-vessel coronary artery disease. Dueto her multiple comorbidities , she underwent a preoperativeevaluation with the chest CT , carotid ultrasound , pulmonaryfunction test , and echocardiogram. The chest CT revealed noevidence of lung cancer recurrence. Carotid ultrasound wassignificant for bilateral ICA stenosis at 60%-65%. PFT showed anFEV1 of 1.2 liters or 61% predicted with an FEV1/FVC ratio at 84%predicted. The echo showed an EF of 55% with mild LVH , mildhypokinesis of the inferior base and evidence of diastolicdysfunction. Based on these test results , the patient was deemedable to undergo CABG.

Abdominal exam was unremarkable.Lower extremities were warm and well perfused. He was able tomove all extremities , 4/5 strength in his right hand. He hadpositive peripheral pulses and 1+ lower extremity edema , leftgreater than right to mid calf.LABORATORY DATA:Laboratory values on admission are significant for creatinine of1.8 of unknown baseline and glucose of 192. LFTs were withinnormal limit. White count of 8.7 , hematocrit of 21.4 , down frombaseline of 30 to 35 and platelets of 351 , 000. MCV on hematocritwas 84.EKG on admission showed irregularly regular rhythm at 120 likelyatrial fibrillation versus atrial flutter with variable block , STsegment depression laterally in V5 through V6 , question demandischemia versus digoxin effect , left bundle branch block which isreportedly the patient's baseline.

Cardiovascular: The patient with no evidence of acutecoronary syndrome. On admission , the patient was noted to be ina rapid ventricular response at 120 and with CHF exacerbation.The patient initially with complaint of chest pressure , which wasconcerning for demand ischemia in the setting significant anemiawith increased heart rate and known ventricular dysfunction.Cardiac enzymes were drawn and serially were elevated with a peaktroponin I of 4. Subsequent serial cardiac enzymes resolved tobaseline values. The patient was initially started on heparin IVdrip for concern for unstable plaque , but following consultationwith Dr. Slaney in Cardiology , it was recommended anticoagulationbe stopped secondary to recent GI bleed and low concern for acutecoronary syndrome versus demand ischemia. Additionally , thepatient was rate controlled with IV following p.o. Lopressor ,digoxin and amiodarone. Additionally , the patient's ACEinhibitor was continued and titrated up to lisinopril 40. Thepatient was initially diuresed given significant volume overloadwith IV Lasix with diuresis of 4 to 8 liters over the hospitalcourse. Echocardiogram obtained during decompensated episoderevealed EF of 25 to 30% with global hypokinesis and septalakinesis , was significantly altered from prior echocardiogram of9/16/03 obtained at the Wellcamp University Of Medical Center which hadrevealed an EF of 40 to 45% with mild global HK. However , ofnote , this echocardiogram was similar to prior echocardiogram inAlehealtdana Bafound Hospital system from 1994 with no additionalwall motion abnormalities. The patient's cardiovascular issuesfelt to stem secondary to anemia in the setting of increasedventricular response and tachycardia , which led to demandischemia and subsequent troponin leak causing decompensated CHF.The patient's symptomatology resolved with proper rate controland resuscitation with IV fluids and blood. The patient's heartrate was well controlled in the 60s to 70s and following IVdiuresis , the patient's CHF symptomatology resolved. At the timeof discharge , the patient was ambulating without difficulty withno oxygen requirement. The patient was transitioned to all p.o.regimen.2. Heme: The patient with recent GI bleed with known both upperand lower GI lesions including AVM and diverticulosis for whichthe patient has been previously treated. The patient'shematocrit on admission 21.4. The patient received 4 units ofpacked red blood cells to stable hematocrit of 29 to 30 x 72hours. In addition , the patient was never hemodynamicallyunstable during admission. GI bleed felt to be a precipitatingetiology. The patient was seen by the GI Service , wasrecommended further outpatient evaluation and upper and lower GIendoscopy evaluation as required. The patient to follow up withDr. Rosendo in the Erpin Medical Center and outpatient EGDand colonoscopy to be scheduled for the next week or two tofurther evaluate. At the time of discharge , the patient'shematocrit stable at 29 , no evidence of active GI bleed present.Additionally , the patient initially held on Coumadin givingconcern for ongoing GI bleed and following stable transfusion ,the patient's Coumadin was restarted at initially 5 and thenlater 3 mg p.o. q.h.s. with INR goal of 2.8. To be furtherevaluated as outpatient and INR to be checked on 5/11/04 in Dr.Paider office and titration of Coumadin as required.3. GI: As mentioned prior , the patient with GI bleed , thoughtto be precipitating etiology of the patient's currenthospitalization. The patient maintained on IV Protonix b.i.d.and transitioned to p.o. Prilosec 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. Asmentioned , prior to GI consult , the patient will receive theoutpatient evaluation with EGD and colonoscopy as required forfurther management.4. Pulmonary: The patient with history of productive cough ,fevers , chills. On admission , previously treated with course ofantibiotics , presumably Levaquin for presumed community-acquiredpneumonia giving ongoing symptomatology , the patient treatedinitially with IV antibiotics including ceftriaxone andazithromycin transitioned to cefpodoxime and azithromycin. Thepatient to complete full 10-day course of antibiotics forpresumed community-acquired pneumonia. At the time of discharge ,the patient afebrile , ambulating without difficulty , no dyspneaon exertion and O2 saturation 95% on room air.5. Psychiatry: The patient with long tobacco history givenextensive cardiovascular status , the patient received addictionconsultation regarding tobacco cessation. Followingconsultation , the patient showing good promise regarding tobaccocessation. He has expressed interest in doing so. As such , thepatient's antianxiety and depression medications have beenaltered. The patient to decrease Zoloft to 25 mg p.o. q.d. from50 and to continue that for seven days , following which time , heshould discontinue his Zoloft. Additionally , the patient startedon Wellbutrin initially 150 mg p.o. q.d. x seven days , totransition up to b.i.d. as tolerated within seven days time asZoloft is discontinued , recommend further outpatient evaluationas needed.

Status post placement of coronary stents.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. at night , gabapentin 300 mg p.o. atbedtime , allopurinol 150 mg p.o. daily , torsemide 50 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , fentanyl patch 50 mcg anhour q.72 h. , potassium chloride 80 mEq daily , omeprazole 20 mgdaily , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , vancomycin 250 mg orally three timesa day , Flagyl 500 mg three times a day , NPH insulin 25 units inthe morning , and oxycodone 5 mg q.4 h. p.r.n. pain.ALLERGIES:Sulfa causes angioedema.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:On 5/5/2006 , the patient underwent debridement of her left footand amputation of the left fifth metatarsal phalangeal joint. On10/19/2006 , the patient underwent closure of her wound.OTHER TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES:CT angiogram:1. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with multiple focal areas ofmild-to-moderate stenosis seen in the origin of the SMA ,bilateral renal arteries , common and superficial femoral arteriesand popliteal arteries.2. Occlusion of the mid third of the posterior tibial arterywith distal reformation on the right side.3. Three-vessel run off in the left leg.HOSPITAL COURSE:The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service on5/5/2006 after undergoing her amputation. No concerningintraoperative events occurred; please see dictated operativenote for details. She was transferred to the floor from the PACUin stable condition. The patient had adequate pain control andwas tolerating a regular diet by postoperative day #0. She wasplaced on a fluid restriction in light of her congestive heartfailure. The patient's wound was clean with no evidence ofhematoma collection. She underwent wet-to-dry dressing changest.i.d. The patient underwent a CT angiogram to evaluate herlower extremity vasculature; please see the results noted abovein the procedure section. In summary , the patient's three-vesselrun off to the left lower extremity indicated that she would notlikely need a bypass for wound healing at this time. Inaddition , because the patient's wound was clean , Dr. Fregeau deemedthat it is appropriate to proceed the closure of the wound. As aresult , on 10/19/2006 , the patient returned to the operating roomand underwent closure of her wound; please see Dr. Visage 'sdictated operative note for details of this procedure. Followingboth of the patient's procedures , her pain was well controlledwith oral pain medications. The patient's cardiovascular statusremained stable postoperatively. She did continue on herhome/rehabilitation facility medication regimen for hercardiovascular issues. The patient remained stable from arespiratory standpoint. The patient did continue to have loosebowel movements during her hospital stay. She continued on heradmission regimen for Clostridium difficile , which consisted oforal Flagyl and oral vancomycin. There were multiple attempts tosave a stool specimen; either the patient did not save the stoolat times or it was mixed with copious amounts of urine. As aresult , a Clostridium difficile test is pending at the time ofdischarge and will need to be followed up for test of cure whileat rehabilitation. The patient's hemodynamic status wasmonitored closely as well as her fluid status. The patient wasplaced on a 1500 mL fluid restriction due to her CHF. Thepatient did have a slight rise in her creatinine from 1.4 to 1.8 ,at the time of discharge , the patient's creatinine was trendingback down to 1.4. The patient's electrolytes were monitored andrepeated as necessary during her hospital stay. The patientreceived subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis while as aninpatient. The patient's cultures from the operating room werepositive for MRSA , and as a result , she continued on IVvancomycin. The patient is to continue her IV vancomycin regimenthrough follow up with Dr. Gittins in clinic. The patient was seenby the Diabetes Management Service for evaluation of her diabetesas her blood sugars were elevated on her admission regimen. As aresult , the Diabetes Management Service recommended a regimenconsisting of 25 units of NPH in the morning , 8 units of NPH atbedtime , a standing NovoLog regimen of 4 units with meals inaddition a NovoLog sliding scale with meals and at bedtime. Theremainder of the patient's hospital course was relativelyunremarkable and she is to be discharged in stable condition backto rehabilitation with adequate pain control. The patient was given explicitinstructions to follow up in clinic with Dr. Kegerries in one to two weeks.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6 h. p.r.n. pain.2.

POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA.2. LUMBAR DISK DISEASE.3. HYPERTENSION.4. COR PULMONALE.5. TOBACCO SMOKER.HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old womanwith a history of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the Emergency Wardwith a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. She wasintubated for somnolence and worsening respiratory acidosis , andtransferred to the MICU. She had never had any intubationspreviously. She is an active smoker with a long history of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease who is followed by Dr. Jerald FennerMost recently , she was admitted on 8/5/92 for a chronicobstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation which was treated withaggressive bronchodilators. Her baseline ABG on discharge was7.39 , pC02 51.1 , and a p02 of 66 with 91.3% 02 saturation. She hada previous sleep apnea study on 5/25 which was negative. Hermost recent thyroid function tests on 8/6 revealed an FEV1 of 38%and an FVC of 51% , with an FEV1/FVC of less than 80%. This wasfelt to be consistent with a mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern.She has been treated with Theophylline and Proventil as well ashome nebulizers , Lasix , and 02 overnight. She continues to smokeas well as noted above. She has had frequent episodes of cough andproductive sputum as well as lower extremity edema. She nowpresents with one to two weeks of increase in her postnasal drip ,denying any change in her cough or sputum production although shedid note a slightly increased temperature. She began to becomemore short of breath and was taken to the Emergency Ward by hersister. There , she was found to be cyanotic with an 02 saturationof 59%. Her first blood gas on 50% was 7.27 , pCO2 79 , p02 78%saturation after one nebulizer treatment. Her peak flows afterthree nebulizers were only 90. She began to become somnolent witha repeat blood gas showing a pCO2 of 94 , and was thereforeintubated and transferred to the MICU. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Wasremarkable for ( 1 ) asthma/COPD , ( 2 ) polymyalgia rheumatica , ( 3 )borderline hypertension , ( 4 ) lumbar disk disease , ( 5 ) psoriasis ,( 6 ) right sided heart failure , ( 7 ) spinal stenosis , ( 8 ) sinusitis ,( 9 ) obesity. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post cholecystectomyin 1979 , status post back surgery. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Theo-Dur 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , KCL , Lodine 300mg p.o. b.i.d. , Proventil nebulizers p.r.n. , supplemental 02 q.h.s.ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC TO SULFA WHICH CAUSES HER TO HAVE ARASH. HABITS: She continues to smoke , and she has a history of 40pack years. There is no alcohol use. SOCIAL HISTORY: She livesalone. She has two sons. She is assisted by her sister.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , she was an intubated , obesefemale in no acute distress. Her bloodpressure was 140/70 , pulse 70-100 , and temperature of 101.6. HEENTwas unremarkable. Neck: Supple with no jugular venous distention.Lungs revealed diffuse wheezes with an I:E ratio of 1:4. Heart:Tachycardiac with a normal S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs , orgallops. Breasts: No masses. Abdomen: Obese , mild tenderness todeep palpation , normal bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ edema to hercalves bilaterally , no clubbing. Pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedispulses. On neurological exam , she was awake but lethargic anddifficult to arouse , but was able to move all extremities. Herreflexes were 2+ and symmetric bilaterally.LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride98 , bicarbonate 36 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.6 ,glucose 113. Her liver function tests were within normal limits.Her white count was 9.96 , 76 polys , 15 lymphs. Her hematocrit was47.6% with 265 , 000 platelets. The PT was 11.4 , and the PTT was30.5. Theophylline level was 5.3. ABG's were as mentioned above.Post intubation , ABG 7.45 , pCO2 41 , p02 57 , with 91% saturation.The most recent echocardiogram in 1/11 revealed mild concentricleft ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular function.The chest x-ray revealed an increased heart size with noinfiltrates. The urinalysis revealed too numerous to count whiteblood cells and 4+ bacteria. Cultures eventually grew out E. coli.EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with an axis of +8 , right bundlebranch block , inverted T's in V1 and V2 , but no significant changecompared with 11/1HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and continued on theventilator until 3/6/93. She was given aggressivebronchodilator treatment via nebulizers , Albuterol and Atropent.She was started on IV Solu-Medrol dose which was rapidly tapered ona p.o. schedule. She also received two days of IV Ceftriaxone tocover a possible tracheobronchitis. She was also continued on herAncef as well. Her urinary tract infection was treated via theCeftriaxone. She did well over the next two days and essentiallywas ready for extubation on this regimen on 3/6/93. She waswatched overnight and did continue to do well , and was transferredto the floor on 6/14/93. By this time , her 02 saturations were 92%on two liters. She was afebrile , and her peak flows were improvingwith continued Albuterol nebulizers and Atrovent inhaler. Herpolymyalgia rheumatica remained stable during her admission. Therewas a question whether or not her urinary tract infection wasadequately treated as she had several repeat cultures growing 5 , 000colonies of Staph aureus and one also growing diphtheroids. Thesewere clean catches. She had it repeated one more time as a cleancatch , and this was found to grow probable Pseudomonas species ,with an exact speciation pending. This last culture on 5/17/93 wasassociated with an urinalysis that was without white cells. Becauseof this and because of the low cell count , I did not feel that itwas necessary to treat the positive culture until a straight cathspecimen was obtained. The patient was informed that if herdysuria were to persist that she was to call Dr. Gigger immediately ,but that otherwise , her urine was most likely noninfected. Shealso received a sleep study on 1/16/93 which revealed that heroxygen saturations dropped to 46% during REM sleep. This was at apoint when she appeared not to be breathing , and therefore had anelement of essential sleep apnea. She also during periods ofnon-REM sleep alternated between breathing against an obstructionand not breathing at all. This revealed that she also has acomponent of obstructive sleep apnea as well. She was started onProgesterone as an outpatient and will continue to be followed forevaluation for possible nasal C-PAP. The patient was discharged on8/19/93 with a continued good airflow and much fewer wheezes thanpreviously. There were no complications.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Progesterone 20 mg p.o.t.i.d. , Albuterol 0.5 cc in 2.5 normal saline q4hours p.r.n. , Atrovent inhaler two puffs p.o. q4 hours , Prednisonetaper 50 mg p.o. q.d. times two tapering down to 10 mg p.o. q.d.with four days of each dose , continued home 02 at night , Ampicillin500 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , Lodine 300 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Theo-Dur 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and KCL 40 mEq p.o. q.d.

Her podiatrist ofrecord is Dr. Kocieda His telephone number is 092-829-8896.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She is a 66-year-old female withsevere diabetes mellitus type II , autoimmune hemolytic anemia ,peripheral vascular disease , COPD , asthma , and history ofmultiple infections who presents with bilateral lower extremityarea edema , swelling , and pain. She specifically complained ofincreasing erythema , swelling , and pain of the right second toeand left foot x 1 day. She saw her podiatrist on the morning ofadmission , 7/6/2003 , and her right toe was drained at thattime , yielding pus. Cultures were drawn and it was noted thatshe was have increasing erythema over the right ankle and theleft foot all the way to the shin. She had no fever but did havechills , no shortness of breath or cough , wheezing , no dizzinessor orthostatic symptoms. She had recently been admitted between8/7/2003 and 3/2/2003 for a COPD flare , pneumonia , andanemia. She is known to hemolyze additionally in the setting ofinfection. At that time she was treated on steroids and at thetime of this admission , was on a prednisone taper. During thatprior admission , she had also being treated with levofloxacin ,was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells , and was alsobeing treated with Aramis. She had had an abdominal CT duringthat admission for left upper quadrant pain , which demonstratedno evidence of splenic infarct. In the ED on this admission , shewas afebrile , her vital signs were stable , she was started onlevofloxacin , and she had plain films of her right foot , whichwere consistent with evidence of chronic versus acuteosteomyelitis of the second toe.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems , she denied any chestpain , urinary symptoms , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and herfingerstick , she mentioned , had been running high , to the 250s onprednisone. She has a left plantar ulcer as well , which she hadplanned on having surgery soon for.ALLERGIES: To Keflex , Ultram , Vancomycin , and Linezolid. WithLinezolid , she gets headaches and hypertension , with Vancomycinhives , Ultram produces systemic reaction of unclear nature , andto Keflex her allergy is questionable because she has toleratedcephalosporins and penicillins in the past by report of theadmitting team.FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for colon cancer and esophageal cancerin her father and mother respectively.SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a former nurse at Forestnew Medical Center She is married and has one daughter. She has a35-pack year history of smoking but she quit in 1994. No alcoholuse.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Notable for an elevated blood pressure of150/70 , stable heart rate of 70 , afebrile , saturating 100% onroom air , breathing at 18. Other notable aspects of her physicalexamination: Chest: She had a left carotid bruit. Her chestwas clear to auscultation bilaterally with the exception of milddiffuse inspiratory wheezes. Cardiac: She had a regular rate ,distant heart sounds on her cardiac examination but no murmurs ,rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Benign. Back: No CVA tenderness inher extremities. Extremities: She had tense edema , left greaterthan right. She also had an ulcer on the plantar surface of theleft extremity , which was not fluctuant but did haveserosanguinous drainage and erythema that was circumferential tothe mid-shin. There was more tenderness over the lateralmalleolus. She also had some left calf tenderness with aquestionable palpable cord. In her right lower extremity , shehad erythema over the right second toe with a punctate lesiondraining serosanguinous fluid. Discontinuous erythema over theinterior shin was also noted. She had diffuse onychomycosis andright intradigital ulceration between the 4th and 5th toe. Therewas not right calf tenderness that was noted. Neurological:Neurological was grossly intact and there were no focal deficitsnoted.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Infectious Disease: Her blood cultures were positive forgram-positive cocci , which was resistant to methicillin ,clindamycin , and levofloxacin. She had an MRI of the lowerextremities bilaterally , which demonstrated no collections butwas notable for acute osteomyelitis of the left 2nd and 3rdmetatarsal as well as chronic osteitis of the calcaneous wounds.The right phalanges were not visualized well. She was started onLevaquin initially but this was discontinued when thesensitivities came back and instead she was started ondopthromycin. Infectious Disease was consulted at this time andthe antibiotics were changed to Bactrim IV and then to p.o.Bactrim secondary to an increase in her creatinine. A TTE on2/21/2003 was negative for any vegetation. She underwentdebridement on 10/19/2003 in the afternoon. The material wassent for culture. She also complained of sternal discomfort ,dysphasia , and oral thrush on examination , and it was felt thatshe likely had oral candidiasis secondary to her steroid courseand so she was started on Diflucan as well as on a nystatin swishand swallow. The cultures from her bone tissue were positivemethicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus as well asbeta-hemolytic streptococcus. Infectious Disease once again feltthat , given her allergies , that p.o. Bactrim would be the bestway to treat these pathogens. On 3/19/2003 , the Diflucan wasdiscontinued and she was continued on nystatin swish and swallowfor the oral candidiasis , which has since been improving. She isalso being continued on Bactrim and her creatinine has stabilizedat 1.9 after peaking at 2.2. She has follow ups scheduled withthe Infectious Disease physicians on 1/27/2004 and will becontinuing her Bactrim for a full 6-week course with weekly CBCchecks , which will be monitored by her primary care physician ,Dr. Sherman Handel2. Heme: The patient has a history of autoimmune hemolyticanemia. Her hematologist of record is Dr. Bocanegra On herlast admission , she required transfusions and was thought to havehemolyzed in the setting of her pneumonia although her hemolysislabs at that time were negative. On this admission , her LDH andbilirubins were normal , her hematocrit steadily decreased from38.8 to 27 and then increased. She had an increase in her LDHbut no schistocytes were notable on smear. Nevertheless , she wasthought to be hemolyzing and received a total of 6 units ofpacked red blood cells , given in doses of 2 units each over thecourse of this hospitalization. She was transfused successfullywithout any complications or transfusion reactions and herhematocrit at the time of discharge is 36.0.3. Pulmonary: The patient's prednisone taper was discontinuedon day 4 because of oral candidiasis. She was continued on nebs ,however , for intermittent wheezing. She has had no acute COPDexacerbations but has had increased shortness of breathperiodically , which has been improved with nebulizer treatments.Chest x-ray on 1/7/2003 demonstrated a small bilateraleffusion. She was thought to be fluid overloaded at this time soher Lasix was restarted for diuresis. Also of note , the patienthad pain in the left posterior lower lung field , which waspleuritic in nature. She had LENIs done , which were negative ,had a PE protocol CT on 1/7/2003 , which was negative. At thattime , she was diuresed and her pleuritic left lower lobe chestpain resolved with diuresis. She had a recurrence of this pain 2days prior to discharge after receiving 2 units of packed redblood cells , which presumably led to a volume overload situation.However , once again , after diuresis , she had complete resolutionof her symptoms. At this time , the CT scan was reviewed toensure that there was no fracture of the ribs as she did havetenderness in the left lower lung field area. However , the ribswere visualized well and there was no evidence of any fracture.4. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on Toprol and herDiovan was held secondary to elevated potassium. She hadintermittent chest pain without EKG changes , possibly secondaryto esophageal spasm , which was relieved by nitroglycerine. Herenzymes were negative for the first episode. Her troponin was0.25 on random draw. This was likely a false positive and herenzymes thereafter were negative. She had a preoperative MIBI on10/11/2003 , which demonstrated a moderate area of reversibleischemia in the territory of the right coronary artery. Thedecision was made , however , to go ahead with the surgery for herfeet with spinal block , not with general anesthesia. Her Toprolwas increased to 75 mg q.d. given her MIBI findings. Her goalheart rate was set for the 60s and a low-dose statin was alsoadded to her regimen. It was felt that the cardiovascular planin terms of her coronary artery disease should be to increase herexercise tolerance during rehab to the point where she may beginto experience symptoms and then cap at that time can beconsidered. Towards the end of the patient's hospitalization ,she required diuresis , particularly after receiving boluses ofvolume with her blood transfusions. It was noted that , when hervolume status went up , she had an increase in swelling of herlower extremities bilaterally as well as recurrences of herleft-sided back pain in the area of the left lower lung field.However , as noted before , these improved with diuresis.5. Renal: Her baseline creatinine is 1.3 to 1.4 , increased onthis admission likely due secondary to the dye load , which shereceived prior to scans. Her creatinine peaked at 2.7 with theIV Bactrim but began to trend down after the IV Bactrim wasdiscontinued. Other reasons for which her creatinine likelyincreased during this admission were secondary to herdopthromycin and also secondary to the IV Bactrim.6. Endocrine: The patient's blood sugars have been wellcontrolled after her prednisone was discontinued and she wasmaintained on a regimen of NPH.7. Ophthalmology: The Ophthalmology team was consulted for anew left floater. The patient has a history of vitreoushemorrhages and questionable retinal detachment in the past. Theoptic examination was notable for vitreous bleed. In response tothis , the head of the patient's bed was elevated and her symptomswere stable thereafter. If she has a recurrence of curtainssymptoms or spots or flashes , it is recommended thatOphthalmology be reconsulted at that time.8. GI: The patient had complained of right upper quadrant painduring this admission. Her liver function tests were elevatedwhen initially checked. It was recommended by Infectious Diseasesince these would be monitored with IV Bactrim. They have beentrending down since she is status post cholecystectomy and wasinitially very tender in her right upper quadrant. Her rightupper quadrant ultrasound on 10/19/2003 was negative except foran enlarged liver alkaline phosphatase that was thought to besecondary to osteomyelitis. Her right upper quadrant painimproved subsequently during this hospital course with continueddiuresis and antibiotic treatment.DISCHARGE CONDITION: The patient is being discharged at thistime in stable condition to the rehab facility. She is beingdischarged on the following medications.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.2. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.3. Folate1 mg p.o. b.i.d.4. Heparin 5000 units p.o. b.i.d.5.

Pregnancy at 34 weeks with Di/Di twins , IUFD of one twin.2. Diabetes.3. Hypothyroidism.4. High blood pressure , chronic hypertension.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kerry Winninger is a 32-year-oldG1 , P0 who presented to obstetrical triage at 34 weeks' gestationwith mono/Di twins with complaints of decreased fetal movement aswell as cough in the setting of nausea and vomiting. In triage ,the fetal heart tracing on twin #2 was unable to be obtained , soan ultrasound was quickly brought and showed that twin #1 had FH100 to 108 with no evidence of FH in twin #2. Given evidence ofan IUFD and possible fetal distress in twin #2 , she was broughtfor a stat cesarean section which was ultimately complicated bymultiple factors.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Chronic hypertension.2. Hypothyroidism.3. Hypercholesterolemia.4. Obesity.5. Diabetes type II.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: An appendectomy.MEDICATIONS UPON ADMISSION:1. Levoxyl 88 mcg p.o. daily.2.

Pineapple leading to GIdistress.SOCIAL HISTORY: Denied any alcohol , tobacco , or drugs.FAMILY HISTORY: Diabetes in father and grandmother.HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Brain Govea was immediately brought tothe operating room and underwent an uncomplicated stat cesareansection within 15 minutes of her arrival to obstetrical triage.For complete details of the surgery that she underwent , pleasesee the dictation from that day. The preoperative diagnoses werebradycardia , twin #1 , in triage; absent fetal cardiac activity in#2; and 34 weeks gestational age with mo/Di twins. Postoperativediagnoses were listed as chorioamnionitis , diabetes , and demiseof twin #2. The findings were consistent with a live born maleinfant Apgars 5 and 8; a stillborn male infant , Apgars 0 and 0;and intact placenta and a foul-smelling amniotic fluid with lightmeconium in twin #1. There were no complications.Her postpartum course was highly complicated by several issuesthat will be dealt with by system. In short , she suffered a Vfibarrest in the setting of the DIC , potential sepsis , potentialHELLP syndrome , and was admitted to the Medical Intensive CareUnit and intubated. Ultimately , she was discharged from theMedical Intensive Care Unit and was monitored on the labor floorand then was transferred to postpartum where she continued torecover and regain function until postoperative day #12 when shewas discharged home with VNA in stable condition. Her issueswill be dealt with by system.1. Cardiology. Within 3 hours following her for stat cesareansection , she presented with acute onset of shortness of breath ,chest discomfort in the setting of a postpartum hemorrhage.Telemetry was applied and had evidence of widening QRS complexes ,and ultimately , she went into Vfib arrest with pulselesselectrical activity. She underwent aggressive resuscitation inthe form of 2 shocks with epinephrine following the code blue.She was brought back to the operating room where Chem-7 revealedpotassium of 7 which may have been the etiology of this Vfibarrest. A pulse was obtained following the 2 shocks andepinephrine , and she was intubated to clear her airway. She wasthen transferred to the medical intensive care unit where cardiacenzymes were followed for 4 total sets and were found to begrossly positive. The impression of her positive cardiac enzymesthat did trend downwords was that it was secondary to theaggressive chest compressions and were felt not likely to lead tosignificant myocardial injury. An echocardiogram that wasobtained on postoperative day #2 while she was admitted to theMedical Intensive Care Unit revealed no evidence of focal wallmotion abnormalities and showed that the overall left ventricularfunction was normal with an EF of 55%. Of note , throughout herMICU admission , she was tachycardic to 120s to 140s , and thiswas ascribed to her marked amounts of postpartum hemorrhage inthe setting of possible chorioamnionitis with sepsis. Thistachycardia resolved by postoperative day #6 , and bypostoperative day #12 , she was no longer tachycardia with a heartrate in the 80's.Her blood pressure while in the initial postpartum period wasmaintained in the normal range , began to become elevated bypostoperative day #8 , and she was started on postoperative day#10 on her labetalol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. This controlled herhypertension throughout the remainder of her hospital course , andshe was discharged home on labetalol.2. Hematology. Following her stat cesarean section , sheunderwent a postpartum hemorrhage with an estimated hemorrhage of5-6 L of blood from her vagina. This dissection itself had only700 cc blood loss. At this time , her fibrinogen was appreciatedto be 78 and her coags were markedly elevated. In the setting ofDIC , she underwent an aggressive product resuscitation andultimately she received 20 units of packed red blood cells , 7units of fresh frozen plasma , 3 pools of platelets , 1200 mcg ofactivated factor 7A , 2 units of cryoprecipitate , 4 units of 5%albumin , and 1 bag of Hespan within a timeframe of 3 to 6 hours.With this aggressive resuscitation , her hematocrit dropped to aslow as 26.4 , but we within 2 hours , had increased to 61.3.Acutely following this episode after her aggressiveresuscitation , her fibrinogen increased from its low of 87 to337. Her DIC continued to be low-grade , even after beingdischarged from the Medical Intensive Care Unit. For thisreason , she was monitored on the labor floor for an additionalday postoperative day #4 , and her coagulation studies ranged froman INR of 1.2 to 1.4. When she was admitted to postpartum , herINR was 1.1 , and the day before discharge from the hospital , hercoagulation studies were found to be normal with an INR of 1.1and fibrinogen of 377.Her platelets became an area of concern when she presented with aplatelet level that was found to be fluctuating between 90 and185. In the initial presentation after her postpartumhemorrhage. Her platelets while in the Medical Intensive CareUnit went to as low as 57 , and this was felt to be possibly acomponent of her HELLP syndrome versus dilution from her bloodproduct resuscitation also part of her DIC consumptivecoagulopathy. Although her DIC consumptive coagulopathy hadevidence that it had resolved , her platelets remained low andreached another low postoperative #7 when they became 69. Ahematology consult was obtained to evaluate the possible causesof her low platelets , and she underwent an extensive evaluationincluding a negative anticardiolipin and a negative lupusanticoagulant. The impression was one of low platelets secondaryto shock liver in addition to DIC in addition to dilution withmarked amounts of blood products , especially in the setting ofthe hematocrit ranging from the 49 to 50 range at that time. Herplatelets continued to improve throughout the hospital course andher platelets upon discharge were 144 and had trended up from thelow of 69.Her hematocrit initially was found to be very high , uponpresentation at 51. This was consistent with hemoconcentrationwith a trough to as low as 26 while in the Medical Intensive CareUnit. Following her resuscitation , it went to as high as 61. Onpostoperative day #7 , however , it dropped from 46 to 40 and thendropped again to 37.5 upon repeat check. This was of concern but2 subsequent hematocrits were stable in the 39 range. Her finalhematocrit on the day of discharge was 39.5. This droppinghematocrit was discovered in the setting of a rectus musclehematoma that will be dealt with elsewhere in the dictation buther hematocrit was stable upon discharge.3. GI. Upon presentation , Ms. Neeb had evidence of increasingLFTs. While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit , she was found tohave an AST of 177 , ALT of 124 , and total bilirubin of 6.2.These elevated liver enzymes in the setting of her low plateletswas suspicious for possible HELLP syndrome. These LFTs continuedto improve with the AST and ALT dropping down to the normallimits. Upon discharge , she was appreciated to have an ALT of 37and AST of 48. Her bilirubin , however , continued to increasefrom 6.2 to as high as 11.2. In the setting of her increasingbilirubin while the other LFTs continued to improve , a GI consulwas obtained , and she underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasoundtwo times , once while on the labor floor and once while on thepostpartum floor. Both of these revealed a normal liver , normalbiliary tree , as well as normal-sized spleen. In the setting ofa normal nonobstructive picture , the GI consult had theimpression that the increased bilirubin was secondary to hershock liver as well as the multiple blood transfusions andpossible sepsis. They were confident that this would continuedto improve but would likely take 2 to 3 weeks. Upon discharge ,her total bilirubin had begun to decrease to 8.2. She didmanifest evidence of jaundice that was improving through thehospital course.On postoperative day #9 , Ms. Culp developed a marked increase inher amylase and lipase. This was checked in the setting ofincreasing right upper quadrant pain that ultimately resolved.Her lipase was elevated to as high as 438 to 474. GI was againreconsulted and had the impression that she did not suffer frompancreatitis given that she had no nausea or vomiting , wastolerating a regular diet , and had resolved abdominal pain. Theyfelt that this was likely secondary to post-surgical change andwas not an aggressive process that may need further treatment.An abdominal pelvic CT also demonstrated a normal pancreaswithout any evidence of stranding or pseudocyst formation.The overall impression of the Obstetrics team was that herconstellation of acute-onset DIC associated withhyperbilirubinemia and low platelets was all consistent with apotential diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Thisdiagnosis is one that can be best made by a liver biopsy anddiscussions with the GI Service revealed that they did not feelstrongly that she needed a liver biopsy. The GI Service wasskeptical with regard to the diagnosis of acute fatty liver ofpregnancy despite the clinical hallmarks being manifest in thispatient. They felt as if her symptoms could be adequatelyexplained by the degree of shock liver and postpartum hemorrhagethat she experienced. It was unclear as to whether or not shehad acute fatty liver of pregnancy , but given the risk ofrecurrence , she will be counseled as an outpatient with regard tofuture pregnancies and management of these pregnancies , given herhistory of potential acute fatty liver of pregnancy.4. Incision. On postoperative day #10 , she developed a darkblood ooze from a 2-mm portion on the right aspect of herPfannenstiel incision. This was concerning for a possiblesubcutaneous hematoma. So an abdominopelvic CT was obtained onpostoperative day #10 that showed evidence of an 8 x 5 cm rightrectus hematoma that may have had an area of tracking through thefascia into the subcutaneous space. It was felt that this couldundergo dressing daily , and would ultimately seal up and stopbleeding. She was discharged home with VNA daily dressingchanges and plan to reassess the incision at her followuppostpartum appointment in 4 days from the date of discharge. Ofnote , this right rectus hematoma was diagnosed in the setting ofa drop in her hematocrit from 46 to 40. Her hematocrit remainedstable for 2 additional days at 39.5.5. Infectious disease. On postoperative day #0 , following herstat cesarean section. She had a T-Max of 101.9 in the MedicalIntensive Care Unit , and ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycinas well as levoflox ofloxacin were started on IV and wascontinued for 6 days until ultimately her blood cultures grew outno organism. The urine cultures were negative and her placentaculture also demonstrated only staphylococcus coagulase negativewith a Gram's stain showing no organisms. She remained afebrilefor the remainder of her hospital course and was not dischargedon antibiotics.6. Endocrine. Initially following her Medical Intensive CareUnit admission , her blood sugar remained low throughout the daydespite her eating habits. Her blood sugars would get as slow asthe 40s and as high as the 80s. This was perplexing as she wasknown to be type 2 diabetic who initially been managed onmetformin prepregnancy. An endocrine consult was obtained. Theconcern was for possible addisonian crisis and cord stimulationtest was normal as well as a.m. and p.m. cortisol levels werechecked. These remained within normal limits , and the concernfor possible Sheehan syndrome secondary to her massive postpartumhemorrhage was largely excluded. A TSH as well as an ACTH levelwhere both drawn , and her TSH was 1.05 in the normal range andthe ACTH test was 51 , within the normal range. Of note , herblood sugars did trend up near the end of her hospital course.On postoperative day #10 , she was found to have fasting sugars inthe 120s. She was restarted on NPH 10 units daily. q.p.m. andq.a.m. as well as her Humalog sliding scale a.c. She wasdischarged home with prescriptions for NPH as well as her Humalogand will follow her sugars. These will be followed up by herendocrinologist Dr. Kuk within 4 days of this discharge.7. Renal. While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit , shesuffered acute renal failure with a creatinine that went as highas 2.1. This improved to 1.0 upon discharge. Of note , she had adecreased sodium appreciated on postoperative day #7. Urinaryelectrolytes were drawn and fractional excretion of sodium wasappreciated to be 0.32 consistent with prerenal , and the urineosmolality was 400 consistent with concentrated urine that may ormay not have been consistent with syndrome of inappropriate ADH.She underwent fluid restriction for 3 days and her sodiumimproved from 129 to 134 upon discharge.8. Pulmonary. Immediately following her Vfib arrest , she wascomplaining of severe rather shortness of breath and wasintubated on the first attempt. At this time , intubated andsedated , she was in the MICU and was extubated on postoperativeday #2. She was transitioned to nasal cannula after being onFiO2 of 80% and ultimately was discharged home sating 99 to 100%on room air with a good exercise tolerance.9. Infant. Their baby boy Towery was doing very well upondischarge. He was followed by the pediatric service at Chardson Medical Center and was discharged home with them.10. Neuro. Initially , her mental status in the MedicalIntensive Care Unit would wax and wane. She would beintermittently disoriented. A head CT was obtained postoperativeday #4 , and this was shown to have no focal abnormalitiesalthough there was some indication that there might have beensome stranding between the white and gray matter consistent withpossible edema. This report was not mentioned in the finalreport of the head CT. Upon discharge , her mental status was atbaseline with perfect memory of the event leading up to the statcesarean section although she had some difficulty rememberingspecifics with regards to her Medical Intensive Care Unitadmission , and the ensuing days. She was alert and oriented toperson , place , and time.11. Physical therapy. She underwent a physical therapy consultwith the impression of improving physical status and exercise.She was given exercise strategies that she will continue at home.She was offered home physical therapy but declined as shethought the visiting VNA would be adequate and that she was ableto be out of bed with her usual exercise tolerance.DISPOSITION: On postoperative day #11 , status post her statcesarean sections for IUFD with twins and postpartum hemorrhageDIC , she was discharged home with a plan to follow up in the OBclinic in 4 days with Dr. Fred Riter and Dr. Shad BrondykeShe will also be seen by Dr. Durnin of endocrinology. She willhave daily VNA dressing changes and was instructed to call if shehad any fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , increased bleeding fromthe incision or if she had any questions.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.2. Levoxyl 75 mcg p.o. daily.3. Oxycodone 5 to 10 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.4. Senna tablets 2 tabs p.o. b.i.d.5. Simethicone 80 mg p.o. q.i.d.6. Labetalol 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.7. NPH 10 units q.a.m. and q.p.m.8. Humalog sliding scale AC 5-10 units.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:1. Pregnancy , status post stat cesarean section for IUFD ,nonreassuring fetal heart tracing.2. Vfib arrest.3. DIC.4. Severe PET/HELLP.5. Thrombocytopenia.6. Elevated liver enzymes.7. Hypothyroidism.8. A2 gestational diabetes.Ultimately she was discharged home with low platelets.Throughout her hospital course , she was appreciated to haveevidence of low platelets on her first CBC upon presentation toArdma Medical Center as well as chest compressions , and apulse was once again obtained. In the triage , she was found tohave evidence of a demised twin as well as evidence of a heartrate of the second twin in the 90's.eScription document: 2-5532923 HFFocus transcriptionistsDictated By: JODHA , DONNIEAttending: BRETT DOMINIC COBBINS , M.D. TY98Dictation ID 9576305D: 3/15/05T: 3/15/05

He had cardiac catheterization at Ryhoagberg Spisus Community Hospital on August , 1999 which demonstrated a 30%tapering lesion of the left main coronary artery , 70% proximallesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery , 80% lesiondistal to D1 , 100% occlusion of his left circumflex and a 100%occlusion of his right coronary artery. He is admitted on March , 1999 for coronary artery bypass grafting.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Psoriasis and polymyalgia rheumatica ,coronary artery disease and wide eyeglaucoma. His echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricularhypertrophy with a normal ejection fraction. He has a 45 yearhistory of smoking.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Prednisone 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Zocor 40mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Nitropatch.6 ) Enteric coated aspirin p.o. q. day. 7 ) Timolol eye drops tohis left eye. 8 ) Captopril 18.75 mg p.o. three times a day. 9 )Tagamet 50 mg p.o. twice a day. 10 ) Calcium supplementation.LABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission revealed a BUN of 20 ,creatinine 1.2 , white blood cell count 8.8 , hematocrit40.2. Chest x-ray revealed no acute disease.HOSPITAL COURSE: On May , 1999 , he underwent coronaryartery bypass grafting times three with a leftinternal mammary artery to the left anterior coronary artery ,saphenous vein graft to the aorta and a saphenous vein graft fromthe obtuse marginal to the aorta. His intraoperative course wasuncomplicated. On postoperative day number one , he was weaned toextubation and he was treated with stress steroids to preventsteroid withdrawal. On postoperative day number one , he was takenback to the operating room for bleeding. After he was extubated ,he was reintubated and was returned in good and stable condition tothe intensive care unit on renal Dopamine. He was again extubatedand was seen in consultation by the Gastrointestinal Service for aquestion of gastrointestinal bleed since there was a clot seen onthe transesophageal echocardiogram probe at its withdrawal from hisfirst surgery. The Gastrointestinal Service saw any evidence ofany upper gastrointestinal bleed and he was maintained on H2blockers. He was sent to the step down unit on routinepostoperative day number two and his Captopril was increased forafterload reduction. His course improved and he was diuresed for avolume overload still requiring oxygen supplementation on twoliters. His oxygen saturation was only 91% on postoperative daynumber three. He continued to improve and continued to have carefor his respiratory situation with continued diuresis and nebulizertreatments and ambulation.

The patient has had a history ofcoronary artery disease , is status post multiple myocardialinfarctions. In the 1970s the patient had a myocardial infarctionnumber 1 and in 1992 he had his second myocardial infarction , non Qwave MI , refused catheterization. ETT was done and he was treatedwith Atenolol and Isordil. In 2/23/93 the patient had an anteriormyocardial infarction and subsequently had a V-tach , V-fib arrest ,converted with 200 joules at Mid-ma Hospital and received TPA ,heparin , Lidocaine , and his peak CPK value was 7975. Echo revealedan ejection fraction of 20% with anterior apical akinesis , leftatrial enlargement. The course was complicated by post MI chestpain. On 11/27/93 the patient was transferred to Rahfletchgreenesouth Rehabilitation Hospital Of Cardiac catheterization at that point revealed 90% LADlesion and 100% PDA lesion , 90% D1 lesion , and the patient had PTCAof LAD to a remaining 40% lesion and D1 PTCA with 40% residual.Post PTCA course was complicated by flash pulmonary edema andanterior ST elevation which led to emergent cath which revealed a70% LAD , 100% D1 lesion , and this re-occlusion was treated withrepeat PTCA of LAD and intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient wasgiven Captopril and Lasix for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Since then ,the patient was medically managed and in his usual state of healthwithout any chest pain for the two years until about three daysprior to admission when patient had vague abdominal pain ,epigastric ache , and cramp occurring intermittently , lasting for4-6 hour episodes. Occasionally the patient was awaken from sleep.He denied orthopnea , PND , edema. The patient's pain was similarto but not identical to peptic ulcer disease pain. The patientdenied chest pain. On 5/25/96 , the patient was seen by Dr. Mcgrayof PVH . The patient continued to have abdominal pain. Patienthad CHF on examination. An EKG revealed new lateral T wavechanges. The patient was sent to Tanjuan Tialan Vition Hospital and there thepatient became diaphoretic , was short of breath , improved withnitroglycerin and therefore was transferred to Bert Stern Medical CenterIn the Emergency Room , the patient had shortness of breath , bloodpressure elevated to 210/110 , heart rate of 118 , continued to haveabdominal pain and development of chest pain typical of angina. Hereceived Lopressor , IV TNG , aspirin , no heparin secondary toincreased INR to 2.8 , and his shortness of breath subsequentlyimproved. Chest pain resolved. His EKG had T wave inversions inV5 through V6.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Significant for coronary artery diseaseas above. Status post multiple myocardialinfarctions. PTCA of LAD. 2. Peptic ulcer disease. 3.Hypertension. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Status postamputation of right third distal phalanx. 6. History ofnephrolithiasis.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 3 mg q.h.s. , Atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.day , Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor20 mg p.o. q.day , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Nitro patch , andsublingual nitroglycerin.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with brother. Retired heavyequipment operator. He smoked 15 pack years andquit twenty years ago. Alcohol occasionally.FAMILY HISTORY: Positive coronary artery disease in two sisterswith myocardial infarctions.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature of 98 , heart rate of 72 , bloodpressure of 104/68 , respiratory rate of 16.Oxygen saturation of 97%. HEENT examination revealed no JVD.Cardiac examination showed regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6systolic ejection murmur at left lower sternal border. Chest wassoft bibasilar crackles. Abdomen was soft , non-tender ,nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. A ventral hernia was presentwhich was easily reducible. Extremities showed no cyanosis ,clubbing , or edema. Neuro examination was nonfocal. Rectal wasguaiac negative per the Emergency Ward.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium of 144 , potassium of 3.5. He had ahematocrit of 43.6 and white blood countof 9.8. LFTs were within normal range. PT of 20.2 , PTT of 38.2 ,INR of 2.8. ABG on 100% face mask revealed 7.33 , 45 , 193 , 99.6% inthe Emergency Room. Abdominal ultrasound in the Emergency Roomrevealed right renal stones , but no hydronephrosis , no gallbladderstones , no evidence of triple A. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly ,low volume lungs without clear evidence of CHF. EKG upon arrivalin the Emergency Ward revealed sinus tachycardia , T wave flatteningin AVL , T wave inversion V4 through V6 which were new , poor R waveprogression which was old. Pain free EKG revealed resolution of Twave inversion in V4 through V6.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the rule out MIprotocol. He actually ruled out for a myocardialinfarction with a CPK of 168 , CPK2 of 138 , and CPK3 of 147.However on 11/10/96 his T wave inversion in V1 and V2 were noted tobe deeper on C set compared to A set. Subsequently that day thepatient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema. As his IV heparinand TNG were being turned down he became acutely short of breathwith bilateral crackles half way up the lung fields. He was foundto be in flash pulmonary edema which was treated with heparin , IVTNG , and also Lasix. The patient did very well after that and histroponin level at that point was 0. The patient's CPKs wererecycled and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction again.His ABG at that point and during his acute episode of shortness ofbreath was 7.37 , 43 , pO2 of 111 on 6 liters , and after diuresis hewas able to be on room air without any difficulty. It wastherefore decided for the patient to have cardiac catheterization.Cardiac catheterization was performed on 10/4/96 which revealedproximally occluded LAD , 60-70% lesion of OM1 , and 99% lesion ofproximal PDA , and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction withextensive anterior apical akinesis and also inferior apicalakinesis. Based on this it was decided that the patient had threevessel disease. In anticipation of surgical conservation thepatient had a ETT MIBI on 7/11/96 and he was able to go on modifiedBruce protocol 6 minutes. He stopped secondary to fatigue. He didnot achieve target heart rate. His maximum heart rate was 104 and85% of the predicted value. Subsequently the MIBI results revealedanterior wall and septum and apex to be nonfunctional , however thepatient had known transmural myocardial infarction in inferior wallwhich revealed viable myocardium there and also lateral wallnonfunctioning wall. These are the preliminary results. It wasdecided for the patient to have maximal medical management prior toconsideration for surgery. The patient's Isordil dose wasincreased while in hospital and his Coumadin was restarted.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mgp.o. t.i.d , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.day , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.8h. ,nitroglycerin 1/150 p.r.n. chest pain. Coumadin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s ,and Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is being discharged in goodcondition.FOLLOW-UP: With Dr. Ayoub The patient is to be seen within oneweek with Dr. Warmack of Gardmond Hospital forCardiology , and Dr. Bartolomeo of Thoracic Surgery per Dr. Ondrusekrecommendations. The patient has been chest pain free since11/10/96 , since he had the episode of flash pulmonary edema. Hisheparin was discontinued on 1/11/96. The patient remained chestpain free with good oxygen saturation and was not short of breath.Dictated By: LANDON GABREL , M.D. II3Attending: ADAN S.

In July 1995 , patient was admitted to Penle Hospital for symptomatic bradycardia. She ruled out for amyocardial infarction at that time. Echocardiogram revealed leftventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular cavity obstructionwith systolic outflow tract gradient of 20-30 mm of mercury. InSeptember 1995 , patient presented to the Sumri Sondoyle Hospital with complaintsof exertional chest pain with onset after one flight of stairs.She was started on Atenolol. Echocardiogram at that time revealedasymmetric septal hypertrophy , anterior movement of mitral valveduring systole , and peak left ventricular outflow tract gradient of58 mm of mercury. This was consistent with the diagnosis ofidiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Patient was continuedon Atenolol , however , given her history of symptomatic bradycardia ,her dose could not be increased. One week prior to admission , thepatient noted onset of substernal chest pressure described as painin her anterior chest radiating to her jaw. This was usuallyexperienced in the late morning with no obvious relation toexertion usually accompanied by light headedness. On the day ofadmission , patient awoke without pain , however , in the a.m. , sheagain noted onset of substernal chest pressure associated withlight headedness. This lasted for a period of about thirty minutesafter which time she had a syncopal event. The patient fell on herright hip without evidence of head trauma with brief loss ofconsciousness. Within seconds , she was awake and conversant. EMTwas alerted and she was brought to Rit HospitalEmergency Department for further evaluation and management. Shedenied any significant shortness of breath , fever , chills , andsweats.PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Insulin dependent diabetes timestwenty years , status postpancreatectomy , IHSS , and angina.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Nifedipine XL 30 mgp.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,aspirin , and 30 units NPH insulin q.a.m.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of IHSS or sudden deathdocumented.SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient was originally from the Ist. Andfreca , formerteacher , married , and lived with husband. Therewas no significant use of alcohol or tobacco.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , patient was a pleasant elderlyfemale in no acute distress. She wasafebrile with a heart rate of 64 , blood pressure 114/68 ,respiratory rate 16 , and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. HEENT:Examination was notable for anisocoria , right pupil status postprevious surgery , and oropharynx clear without lesions. NECK:Supple without lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distention ,carotids were without bruits , and firm mobile mass on anteriorneck. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Regularrate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , and III/VI late systolic murmur best heardat the left lower sternal border. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES:Without clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. NEUROLOGICAL: Examinationwas non-focal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: CBC showed a hematocrit of 43.1 , whiteblood count 8.6 , platelets 160 ,electrolytes within normal limits with a potassium of 4.7 ,BUN/creatinine 34/0.9 , liver function tests within normal limits ,INR 1.1 , and CK 68. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.006 ,pH 5.5 , and 1+ bacteria , chest x-ray with evidence of tortuousaorta but no acute pulmonary or cardiac disease , and ECG showed asinus rhythm , left ventricular hypertrophy , early repolarization inV1 to V3 , T wave inversion in lead I , first degree AV block ,otherwise with normal intervals , and axis minus 39.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 79 year old female with a history ofIHSS and insulin dependent diabetes who nowpresented with a syncopal episode accompanied by substernal chestpressure. Given the patient's history of chest pain , she was ruledout for myocardial infarction with flat CK and cardiac troponin Iof 0.0. She was placed on cardiac monitor. She was noted to havenormal sinus rhythm at a rate in the fifties to sixties increasingas high as the nineties with exertion. As a result , the patient'sbeta blocker dose was increased as tolerated with close monitoringfor possible bradycardia. Given the likelihood that her symptomscould be related to decreased outflow secondary to IHSS , thePacemaker Service was consulted. It was felt that the patientwould benefit from placement of a permanent pacemaker which wouldpossibly be therapeutic both for IHSS as well as allowing furthertitration of beta blocker for her exertional angina. The procedurewas discussed with the patient and her family in detail and herfamily requested one additional evening to discuss whether or notto proceed with pacemaker placement. She remained on cardiacmonitor and remained asymptomatic throughout her hospital course.Clinically , the patient remained stable. She remained on cardiacmonitor given her history of daily episodes of syncope and chestpain over the last week prior to admission. Her blood sugar wasfollowed closely with fingersticks q.i.d. and she was replaced withsliding scale Regular insulin in addition to her regular NPH dose.On 3/7/96 , the patient underwent placement of a permanentpacemaker , mode DDDR , via her left axillary vein withoutcomplication. The patient remained stable overnight and placementof pacemaker was confirmed with chest x-ray.DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged to home in stable condition.She was instructed to notify her medical doctor forany worsening of chest pain , light headedness , or pain at thepacemaker site. In addition , she was instructed to check theincision site for sign of redness as well as fever and she was toldnot to shower for four days status post pacemaker placement.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 20 mgp.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.8h. , andProcardia XL 30 mg p.o. q.d.

This shortness ofbreath awakened her from sleep. Her blood pressure in theEmergency Room was 230/110 without EKG changes. She responded wellto IV Lasix and IV nitroglycerin , saturating at 99% on 100%nonrebreather mask. Chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonaryedema. Her blood pressure was stabilized on IV nitroglycerin withresolution of her shortness of breath. She was ruled out formyocardial infarction. The patient was also recently admitted onemonth ago to Stonemep Medical Center for flash pulmonary edema withoutevidence of myocardial infarction. Echo on admission showed 30%ejection fraction with anteroapical and posterobasal hypokinesis.Cardiac catheterization in January 1997 showed a 90% proximal RCAlesion and diffuse distal LAD disease. During vigorous rehydrationfollowing that cardiac catheterization , she developed recurrentpulmonary edema requiring intubation from which she was weanedfollowing diuresis. Because her pulmonary edema was believed to beischemia related , she was transferred to the Ha Hospital for RCA angioplasty. On this admission , she denies anychest pain , shortness of breath , or dizziness. She has threepillow orthopnea , ankle edema. She denies any paroxysmal nocturnaldyspnea with the exception of her current presentation. Thepatient's coronary risk factors include diabetes mellitus ,hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , post menopausal status withouthormone replacement therapy , and history of tobacco use.

Neurological examination was grosslyintact.LABORATORY DATA: BUN was 59 , creatinine 3.9 , hematocrit 28.9 , andMCV 82.3. Magnesium was 2.4. Chest x-ray fromoutside hospital was consistent with pulmonary edema. EKG revealednormal sinus rhythm at 81 , normal axis and intervals ( QT slightlyincreased at 0.46 ) , LVH , LAE. There was T flattening in AVL.There were no acute ST or T wave changes.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient was much improved aftersuccessful diuresis with improvementof her pulmonary examination and no evidence of right sidedfailure. She was saturating well on room air. Care was taken todiurese slowly in order to present a prerenal insult. She remainedsymptom free for the duration of her hospital course.2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The patient denies ever having had anychest pain , but had known anatomy with single vessel disease ( RCA ).Her history is suggestive of possible silent ischemia consistentwith her diabetic status. Her anginal equivalent appears to beshortness of breath. The patient underwent cardiac catheterizationon 6/2/97 with PTCA plus stent placement to her RCA with a goodresult. She is on Ticlid for two weeks. Her blood pressure waswell controlled in her target range of 140-160 systolic bloodpressure on hydralazine , Lasix , and Lopressor. The day followingcardiac catheterization , her hematocrit and creatinine remainedstable at 30.9 and 3.7 , respectively. On 7/4/97 , her creatinineincreased to 4.2. This increase was thought to be due to acombination of prerenal insult in addition to possibledinephropathy. She was hydrated gently and her creatinine waswatched for the next two days , stabilizing in the 4.4 to 4.5 range.3. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Etiology was unknown , possiblysecondary to diabetes mellitus or hypertensive nephropathy. Shehas history of creatinine rises to high 3s and 4s during recenthospitalizations. Hospital course is as described above. Inaddition , Axid was changed to renal dosing ( q.day ) and the patientwas treated for a urinary tract infection. In reviewing thehospital records , there is no evidence of previous work up forrenal artery stenosis. This patient with history and physical tocontrol blood pressures and flash pulmonary edema in the setting ofhypertension may benefit from further evaluation of possible renalartery stenosis. This work up was deferred during thishospitalization due to management of acute issues.4. DIABETES MELLITUS: This was stable , diet controlled.5. ANEMIA: The patient was worked up for her baseline lowhematocrit , found to have an iron deficiency anemia treated withNiferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. Given her underlying renal failure ,there may also be a renally driven component to her anemia and shemay benefit from Epogen as an outpatient.The patient was discharged to home in stable condition to follow upwith Dr. Andre Smithe , her cardiologist , in two weeks , and herprimary care physician in one week based on previously scheduledappointment.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.day , hydralazine 50 mgp.o. q.i.d. , Isordil 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual q. 5 minutestimes three p.r.n. chest pain , Timoptic 0.25% one drop OU b.i.d. ,Axid 150 mg p.o. q.day , and Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. for twoweeks.

The patienthas been in his usual state of health active in the Cape O until henoticed progressive chest pain with chest tightness and shortnessof breath , but no light-headedness , nausea or vomiting which hasbeen progressing over the past few months. The patient did notoccur at rest , but occurred with minimal exertion. The patient hadan EKG as an outpatient which showed ST-T wave abnormalities and hewas advised to come to the hospital.The patient presented to the Box Ro University Hospitals Of and was heparinized.At that time his CKs were stable and his EKG did not show anyinfarction. The patient had an echocardiogram and a Persantinethallium stress test which was remarkably positive. The patientdeveloped substernal chest pain after one minute. The patient wastreated with 100 milligrams of aminophylline and two sublingualnitroglycerines. His EKG revealed 2.5 millimeter ST depression inleads 2 , AVf and V3-V6. His thallium images showed profusionabnormalities in the posterolateral , anterior walls and also theseptum. The septum and apex were nearly completely filling in therest of the images.The patient has now been transferred to the Biee Nino Hospital for further evaluation and intervention.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Included the above. He had a CABG in1981 and by office report , had an SVG to theLAD in D1 and also and SVG to the distal RCA on OM1.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.MEDICATIONS: On transfer , NPH insulin 12 units subcu q. h.s. ,aspirin 81 milligrams p.o. q.d. , digoxin 0.25milligrams p.o. q.d. , Glucotrol 10 milligrams p.o. q. a.m. ,gemfibrozil 600 milligrams p.o. q. h.s. , Atenolol 100 milligramsp.o. q.d. , nitropaste 1" q.8h. , IV heparin 1000 units per hour ,Colace 100 milligrams two b.i.d.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works three times a week at the Iand he has a remote history of tobacco withsmoking 1-1-1/2 packs per day for 20 years , but also quit 20 yearsago. The patient drinks infrequently , but used to drink more inthe past.FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease in hissister and his brother. His brother had a CABGat age 73.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient at this time denies any shortnessof breath , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspneaorthopnea or dyspnea on exertion.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.0 , heart rate 49-53 , bloodpressure 140/70 , respirations 20 , O2saturation 96% on room air. In general , the patient seemedcomfortable. His sclera were anicteric. JVP was 5 centimeterswith good carotids. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterallyfrom anterior. Cardiovascular: Regular with a II-III/VI harshcrescendo , decrescendo systolic murmur in the right upper sternalborder , and also a I-II/VI diastolic decrescendo murmur in the leftlower sternal border. Abdomen was soft , nontender and nondistendedwith normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities showed 1+ pitting edemato the mid shins. Neurologically , he was alert and oriented timesthree. Extraocular movement are intact. Pupils are equal , roundand reactive to light , 3-4 millimeters bilaterally. Otherwise , hisexamination was grossly nonfocal , but he has mild paresthesiasdistally. Reflexes are 0 at the ankles , 0 at the ankles , butsymmetric and 2+ in the upper extremities.LABORATORY: He has a normal SMA-7. His hematocrit is 41 withWBCs 7.9 , platelet count 163 , 000. His CK is 104. HisLFTs are within normal limits.His electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia at 51 with firstdegree AV block and T wave inversions in 1 and L with ST-T waveabnormalities in V4-V6.His chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly with mild superior vascularredistribution.HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Iamiceli was taken to the CardiacCatheterization Laboratory where acatheterization revealed a left dominant system with a left mainthat was okay and LAD was totally occluded proximally. The leftcircumflex had 30% stenosis with 4-50% distal stenosis of thebifurcation of the left PDA , also with a PDA of 80% lesion with PLVof 40% and OM1 with a tubular 40% lesion. The RCA was totallyoccluded at the ostial region , this was old. SVG to the LADlooked okay , but the LAD itself distally had 90% lesions. The SVGto the PDA to OM1 was totally occluded. The SVG to the diagonalhad a 95% ostial lesion. There was no MR. A PTCA was performedwith an SVG to the diagonal also with two 3.5 PS stents placedresulting in 0% residual.Also noted by Dr. Keyl , is that the operative notes from Nas Louskoci Prinbap General Hospital from 1981 says that there are two skip SVGto the PDA to the OM1 , also SVG to the D1 , to the LAD which isincorrect. There are actually separate SVGs to LAD and to D1 and athird SVG must be totally occluded to the PDA to OM1.After the catheterization , the patient was admitted to theCardiology Cleve Ti Er , Georgia 46841 Team where he continued to be heparinized andsupported with rate control awaiting a second cardiaccatheterization which was to correct the distal LAD lesions. Thepatient had an unremarkable hospital course and underwent hissecond cardiac catheterization and PTCA on 10/15/97 which resultedin the two distal LAD lesions which were each 90%. The patientunderwent PTCA to a residual of 10-20%.The patient tolerated this procedure well and subsequently had avery small left groin hematoma , but was otherwise okay. Heremained afebrile with stable vital signs and was discharged on9/20/97 in good stable condition.DISPOSITION/FOLLOW UP: The patient was discharged in good andstable condition on 4/3/97. He willfollow up with Dr. Errol Turgeon in 1-2 weeks. The patient alsowill return to have his blood drawn for a CBC check in two weeksand also in four weeks because he is discharged on Ticlid.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams p.o.q.d. , Atenolol 100 milligrams p.o. q.d. ,Captopril 25 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. , Gemfibrozil 600 milligramsp.o. q. h.s. , Glucotrol 10 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. , NPH insulin 12units subcu q. h.s. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingually q.5 minutes times three p.r.n. chest pain , Ticlid 250 milligrams p.o.b.i.d. times 14 days ( this was started on 10/10/97 ).ACTIVITIES: As tolerated.DIET: No added salt , low fat/low cholesterol , ADA 1800 calories.OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: Status post PTCA and stent placements timestwo 10/10/97 and status post PTCA 3/8/97.Dictated By: ERIC METZGAR , M.D. OY69Attending: DAMIEN O.

Presenting problem wasshortness of breath. Problem list included anxiety , status postcholecystectomy in 1988 , headaches , asthma , hypertension , vertigo ,question of pneumonia in February 1996. Patient's cardiac riskfactors included a history of hypertension , she had no knownhistory of elevated cholesterol , she did not smoke , and had nohistory of diabetes or family history of cardiac disease. She hadno prior myocardial infarction and no history of angina. Thepatient did have a history of asthma with no prior hospitalizationsor steroid tapers. She did take p.o. Proventil at night and therewere no pulmonary function tests available on record. Two daysprior to admission , the patient noted sudden onset of inability tosleep secondary to shortness of breath when lying down. Thepatient tried her inhaler without relief of symptoms. She alsonoted an intermittent nonproductive cough. The patient deniedfevers or chills. She reported that her symptoms did not improveduring the day and the night prior to admission , the patient notedshortness of breath on exertion. She denied chest pain or chestpressure. She had no diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting , or lightheadedness. The patient presented to Bellmarle Medical CenterEmergency Department for persistent inability to sleep. Onevaluation in the Emergency Room , her blood pressure was 136/75with a pulse of 124 , respiratory rate of 32 , and saturations of 94%on room air. She was given nebulizers times three then 20 mg ofintravenous Lasix. She put out 600 cc of urine to that Lasix. TheEmergency Department then attempted to give her Verapamil 5 mgtimes three to decrease her heart rate which was not effective.The patient had no prior history of cardiac event. Her lastexercise test was in 1993. She went three minutes and five secondson the treadmill and stopped secondary to shortness of breath. Hermaximum heart rate was 130 with a maximum blood pressure of 190/80.She had a baseline left bundle-branch block and therefore , her EKGwere not interpretable.ALLERGIES: Patient had no known drug allergies.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Meclizine 25 mg t.i.d. , Proventil tablet 4 mgp.o. q.h.s. , oxazepam 10 mg p.o. q.8h. ,hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d. , and Flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h.SOCIAL HISTORY: Habits included that patient did not drink alcoholand she did not smoke cigarettes. Patient livedat home with her family who were very involved with her care.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was an elderly Hispanic woman in noacute distress. Vital signs included atemperature of 98.2 , blood pressure 108/59 , pulse 101 , andrespiratory rates of 30 with saturations of 92% on three liters.HEENT: Examination revealed a jugular venous pressure at 6 cm.CHEST: Showed bilateral rales two thirds of the way up withoutwheezes and no focal findings or egophony. CARDIAC: Examinationshowed a regular rate and rhythm , tachycardic with a normal S1 andS2 , no murmurs , and no S3 or S4. ABDOMEN: Showed a well healedsurgical scar , breath sounds present , no hepatosplenomegaly , and nohepatojugular reflux. EXTREMITIES: Without edema , clubbing , orcyanosis and she had 2+ symmetrical distal pulses. NEUROLOGICAL:Examination was within normal limits.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was within normal limits with a BUNof 15 and a creatinine of 1.0 , CBC showeda white count of 9.45 , hematocrit of 36.5 , and platelets of 338.CK was 110 and troponin was 0.0. Chest x-ray showed increasedheart size with bilateral increased interstitial markingsconsistent with pulmonary edema and positive pulmonary vascularredistribution. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 106 beats perminute with normal intervals , an axis of negative 16 , a leftbundle-branch block , and no significant changes since 5/6/97.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for new onset congestiveheart failure. She was ruled out for myocardialinfarction. On the second day of hospitalization , she underwent anexercise tolerance test MIBI on which she went four minutes andeleven seconds on a modified Bruce protocol. She stopped secondaryto fatigue. She denied chest pain , there were no EKG changes , andshe had several bursts of nonsustained supraventricular tachycardiawith exercise. Nuclear images revealed mild fixed reduced uptakein the inferior wall consistent with a small injury but no evidenceof ongoing ischemia. An echocardiogram was also performed thatrevealed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis and anejection fraction of 15% to 20%. She had mild mitral calcificationwith mild regurgitation , trace tricuspid regurgitation , and anormal right ventricular size and function. It was determined thatthe patient would benefit from afterload reduction and inatropygiven her poor ejection fraction. She was started on Captopril ,Digoxin , and Isordil in addition to the Lasix she had received uponpresentation for her congestive heart failure.

STATUS POST AAA REPAIR IN 1994.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75 year old with a longhistory of coronary artery disease whopresents with unstable angina.The patient has a long history of stable and unstable angina ,suffered a nonQ-wave myocardial infarction 2 of JulyPAST CARDIAC HISTORY: 1978 - myocardial infarction. 1980 -coronary artery bypass graft with porcinemitral valve replacement. Saphenous vein grafts were performed onthe LAD , PDA arteries. 1991 - Repeat coronary artery bypass graftbecause of recurrent angina , LIMA to LAD graft. 16 of August - Laserangioplasty. 16 of February - Laser angioplasty. 28 of May - Episodes of TIA ,seizures and was begun on Coumadin. 1 of May - Abdominal aorticaneurysm repair , nonQ-wave myocardial infarction by enzymes atSoundbellley Coursi Medical Center .Since July 1995 he has had worsening of his angina to the pointwhere he had it several times a week while walking very shortdistances. He required prophylactic nitroglycerin before walking.In the week prior to admission , the angina increased to severaltimes a day , requiring 2 or 3 nitroglycerins for relief where asbefore required only 1.On the day prior to admission , he had recurrent chest pain whichwas unresponsive to nitroglycerin. He presents originally to theTroga Seph'snob Memorial Hospital Health Services ER where he was treated with IV nitroglycerinand heparin and had recurring chest pain.He was transferred to Stownhu Palio General Medical Center for furthermanagement.At the Er Hney University Hospital he ruled in for myocardialinfarction with CKs in the low 300s , MB of 29.8. He was taken tothe cath lab where an angiography showed an occluded leftcircumflex and an occluded LAD path of the first diagonal andoccluded proximal RCA , occluded saphenous vein graft to the LAD andoccluded saphenous vein graft to his OM and patent LIMA to LAD andsaphenous vein graft to the PDA.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As summarized above under significantproblems.MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM RELAND HOSPITAL : Isordil 20t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. , Dilantin100 t.i.d. , proscar 5 mg q.d. , Hytrin 2 mg q.d. , IV heparin and IVTNG.ALLERGIES: None known.SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his wife , former employee of theCorp Codelping StaPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission - Elderly , moderately obese manin no current distress. Heart rate is 63 to75 , blood pressure 108/64 , R 10-14. HEENT - Within normal limits.Neck - No jugular venous distention. CV - Regular rate and rhythmwith a systolic 1/6 murmur at the right upper sternal border.Lungs - Crackles 1/3 of the way up.LABORATORY DATA: Admission - Normal electrolytes , creatinine ,CBC - hematocrit 35 , platelets 43 , 000 , PT/PTT19.2 and 6.1 , respectively. CK were 311 and 333.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the CCU and was takento the Cardiac Cath Lab with cardiaccatheterization as detailed above. The decision at that time wasmade that his findings were not amenable to angioplasty or tosurgical intervention. He was put on an intra-aortic balloon pumpfollowing catheterization. Medications were increased to relieveafter load and decreased ischemia.His course in the CCU was notable for continued episodes of chestpain and difficulty weaning from the intra-aortic balloon pump. Hewas seen by the cardiac surgery team and they did not feel he wasamenable to revascularization. In addition , he was not a candidatefor laser revascularization protocol under Dr. Stusse and thatprotocol was closed.On 8 of June the patient was successfully weaned from intra-aorticballoon pump and did not have further chest pain at that time. Hewas at this point using SL nitroglycerin prophylactically. On 24 of Junethe patient was transferred to Cardiology A Service.On the floor , the patient continued to have episodes of chest painup to 2 or 3 times a day which were relieved with nitroglycerin SL.On 14 of August he had more severe episode of chest pain refractory to 3nitroglycerin and eventually improved with 6 mg of morphine and 10mg of IV Lopressor. His pain had occurred at rest and lasted atotal of approximately one hour. After this event , the angioplastyteam was reconsulted concerning the possibility of addressing someof the patient's cardiac lesions. It was agreed that this is ahigh risk procedure but after extensive discussion with him and hisfamily; both decided to attempt an angioplasty of his LAD lesion.He was briefly admitted to the HYJU for intra-aortic balloon pumpprior to the procedure and subsequently on 26 of November underwent PTCA ofhis distal LAD to a 30% residual stenosis. He also underwent PTCAof his proximal LAD to residual 20% stenosis. He was successfullyand rapidly weaned from the intra-aortic balloon pump andreadmitted to the cardiology Dabri Hwy. , Loschusonhass , New York 85015 service on 16 of AugustThe patient's subsequent course was characterized by decreasingepisodes of chest pain. He began to ambulate in his room andsubsequently around the Ci without chest pain. He continuedthroughout final week of hospitalization to have one episode ofchest pain on awakening , always relieved with 1 SL nitroglycerinand occasionally relieved without any nitroglycerin.On 24 of April , the patient was in good condition without angina ,walking around the Stara Shing Ford and scheduled to be transferred to Maho Hospital He has also undergone anticoagulationwith Coumadin for his dyskinesis. He is discharged with a goodINR. He has upon discharge a 24 hour Holter monitor that ispending which was performed to evaluate his pacer function.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Captopril 50 mgp.o. t.i.d. , digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. ,Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor 40 mgp.o. q.d. , metoprolol 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , SL nitroglycerin asneeded , Hytrin 2 mg p.o. q.d. , proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin 3mg p.o. q.d.He is discharged in good condition to the Nadbyrdri Packweah Hospital and he will follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist ,Dr. Alphonse Spreen at the Nerknox Byter Nalparkm Medical Center .Dictated By: HAL KATES , M.D. BR95Attending: WARD E.

Asthma exacerbation.SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. Coronary artery disease.3. Chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease.4. Sleep apnea.5. Hypertension.6. Obesity.7. Tobacco history.HISTORY: A 61-year-old female with a long tobaccohistory of COPD , and recently diagnosedsleep apnea is admitted with an asthma flare. In 1981 , she had aDVT which required IVC filter placement. In 1983 , she had anonQ-wave MI and cath at that time showed an 80% proximal LADstenosis , 30% RCA stenosis treated medically. In October of 1991 ,the patient had an exercise test in which she went four minutesin 28 seconds , stopped because of fatigue and there were nodiagnostic EKG changes. PFT's at that time were reportedlynormal , although details are not available at this time.In July of 1991 , further evaluation of the patient's dyspneaincluded multiple normal EKG's , a low probable VQ scan. She wastreated with steroids and inhalers ( Bronchosol ) with good relief.In September 1991 , the patient had recurrent dyspnea on exertion. Sheruled out for an MI at Jeanes Medical Center . Repeat Cathshowed an LAD stenosis of 40% , RCA of 80% and an ejectionfraction of 73%. She was discharged on medical management.In February of 1991 , the patient was diagnosed with "asthma"/COPDand had another rule out MI for dyspnea. At that time , she hadanother ETT in which she went four minutes and 45 seconds ,stopped secondary to chest pain , however , the EKG wasnondiagnostic. Thallium showed fixed anterior defects ( althoughthe effects overlying breast tissue cannot be ruled out ).Bronchoscopy showed mild bronchitis and , since that time , she wasdischarged on a prednisone taper which had gradually been tapereddown to 11 mg a day.Of note , the patient also has been diagnosed with sleep apnea forwhich she is on nasal CPAP. She sleeps in a chair due toorthopnea and occasionally has paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.The most recent pulmonary function tests ( January 1992 ) showed anFEV1 of 1.76 , an FVC of 2.5 , ratio of 70% , DLCO of 28.3. Atwenty-four holter was negative for arrhythmias. Exercise testat that time , she went nine minutes and had no ST changes.Thallium images were again unremarkable.One week prior to admission , the patient developed symptoms ofupper respiratory infection including sneezing , rhinorrhea ,headache and had increased shortness of breath. Steroids wereincreased as were nebulizers with symptomatic improvement. Overthe five days prior to admission , the patient had increasingshortness of breath , wheezing worse at night. She denies fevers ,chills , sweats , nausea , vomiting , chest pain , abdominal pain ,cough , rash or joint pain.In the Emergency Room , the patient was in marked respiratorydistress for which she was given nebulizer and begun on IV Solu-Medrol. Peak flow at that time was 180.Past medical history , COPD , coronary artery disease status postnonQ-wave MI 1983. Obesity. Sleep apnea. Allergic rhinitis.Status post cholecystectomy. Benign breast cyst resection.History of labyrinthitis. History of Sjogren's disease with apositive anti DNA antibody. History of DVT status post IVCfilter in 1983.ALLERGIES: Sulfa has caused swollen mouth ,Theophylline causes jitteriness.MEDICATIONS: Albuterol nebulizers t.i.d.; Kay-Ciel8 mEq q.d.; Prednisone 11 mg q.d.;Guanfacine 600 mg b.i.d.; Verapamil 240 SR q.d.; Lasix 40 mgb.i.d. ( q.d. if feels okay ). Cromolyn nebs q. 6 hours ( rarelyuses ); Nasobid inhaler b.i.d.; Ranitidine q. h.s. HABITS:Tobacco history , quit approximately two years ago , rare alcohol.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Obese , pleasant female in mild shortnessof breath initially but responded tonebs and steroids. Otopharynx was clear. There was no thrush.NECK: Supple. Carotids 2+. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate andrhythm , very distant. LUNGS: Decreased breath sounds at bases ,scant wheezes , no crackles. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender.EXTREMITIES: Obese , no marked edema , although difficult toassess secondary to obesity. SKIN: No visible lesion.NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly within normal limits.LABORATORY DATA: Potassium 3.6 , BUN 16 , creatinine 0.9 ,white count 15.1 , urinalysis negative.Chest X-ray , no significant disease except for a question of mildCHF changes.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated with IVsteroids , nebulizers , oxygen , and didquite well. The trigger for her asthma remains illusive. Sheunderwent an esophageal acid study to rule out subclinicalaspiration ( results pending at the time of discharge ). There wasno infectious component to her exacerbation detected , althoughpreceding viral illness cannot be excluded. The patient wastreated with subcutaneous Heparin for DVT risks.On hospital day number four , the patient was converted toPrednisone without complications. She had no episodes of chestpain and there was no evidence for ischemic etiology.At the time of discharge , the patient's peak flows were greaterthan 500 and her lung exam had cleared remarkably. She istransferred to Foflotroy Hospital for respiratoryrehabilitation on the following medications: Aspirin one tabletp.o. q.d.; Atrovent puffers two puffs q. 4 hours; Beconase nasalinhaler two puffs q. 6 hours; Heparin 10 , 000 units subcutaneousb.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg q. h.s.; Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. d. ( taperas tolerated ); Albuterol nebulized treatments q. 4 hours asneeded; Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Verapamil SR 240 mg p.o. q.d.;Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. a.m. p.r.n.; Beclovent neb six puffs p.o.q.i.d.ADDENDUM:Regarding the patient's esophagram results , the patient had a48-hour esophageal pH monitor which showed that the patient hasreflux episodes and parameters which are within normal limits;however , 4/7 cough episodes are correlated with the patient'scough and asthma flares are possibly related to her refluxsymptoms; however , the study was not completely diagnostic.Benefit from anti-reflux medications such as Reglan on adiagnostic and therapeutic trial , we should also consider furthergastroesophageal reflux studies such as manometry as anoutpatient.Dictated By: TREY BOGHOSIAN , M.D. HAACK , EMIL D.KJ001/8881 /RAFAEL EDUARDO AVERETT , M.D. AY1 D: 5/12/28T: 8/6/92Batch: P402 Report: CX780L2 T:

Ejection fraction of 25% ,left atrium 5 cm mildly enlarged , global hypokinesia , no obviousthrombi , PA SBP 57 mmHg. EEG performed on 5/25/2006 by Pat Byford was consistent with mild encephalopathy of toxic ,metabolic , traumatic , or other origins. No definitive , focal , orepileptiform features. Previous EEG done on 9/17/2006 revealedsimilar findings. Head CT on 5/25/2006 by Lanny Chiarito showedprominent ventricles and sulci that appear appropriate for thepatient's age. No acute intracranial process.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted with an elevatedBNP and chest x-ray consistent with CHF flare , likely secondaryto UTI. On arrival to the floor , the patient was hemodynamicallystable and asymptomatic. EKG and one set of cardiac enzymes werenegative for cardiac ischemia and his home cardiac medicationswere restarted. On examination , the patient had elevated JVP andedema , suggesting that he was volume overloaded. The patientresponded to diuresis with torsemide 5 mg IV and metolazone 2.5mg by mouth. He was switched to his home dose of torsemide 30 mgp.o. and was euvolemic on discharge. Echocardiogram wasperformed on 5/25/2006 to rule out structure etiologies for CHFflare. Results showed no significant change from previous echodone on 6/27/2006. The patient was on telemetry during thehospital course and was noted to have atrial fibrillation withpremature ventricular contractions. He remained asymptomatic andhemodynamically stable throughout the hospital course.2. ID: UTI contributing to his CHF flare and MS changes.Urinalysis was positive and the outside hospital reportedGram-negative rods. The patient was continued on a 10-day courseof p.o. Levaquin. TP-IgG was negative.3. Pulmonary: Chest x-ray on admission was consistent with mildinterstitial pulmonary edema. The patient remained asymptomaticwith no oxygen requirement. The patient responded well todiuretic therapy for CHF flare.4. Neurology: The patient's altered mental status was thoughtto be secondary to urinary tract infection without metaboliccauses. B12 , folate , TSH , and T4 were within normal limits.TP-IgG was negative. Iron was slow with small hypochromia onsmear , suggesting mild iron deficiency. EEG was also performedon 5/25/2006 as this patient displayed fluctuations in cognitivefunction that could be related to seizure activity. EEG wasnondiagnostic for epileptiform features. The patient was startedon Keppra 500 mg twice a day. His mental status appeared to be at baseline attime of discharge5. Renal: Creatinine 1.4 , baseline creatinine was monitoredduring diuresis. Creatinine trended down to 1.3 on discharge.Gross hematuria was present upon arrival to floor secondary topatient pulling on catheter in his altered mental state. Bladderscan ruled out obstruction and the bladder was irrigated toremove clots. As the patient's mental status improved , he nolonger pulled on the catheter and the hematuria resolved. Hecontinued to have some bleeding around the catheter secondary toBPH and the trauma from manipulation of the catheter.6. Wounds: The patient had a nonhealing ulcer on the leftAchilles , recently seen at Usccaialt Hospital by Dr.Kampmann , Plastic Surgery. He saw the patient and recommendedPanafil spray for the wound and frequent dressing changes. Thepatient will follow up with Dr. Ousley as an outpatient.7. GI: Distended abdomen with question of ascites. LFTsreturned within normal limits , no indication for ultrasound.8. Hematology: Hematuria as described above which resolved withimproved mental status. The patient's hematocrit remained stablethroughout the hospital course. The patient has a history ofelevated INR , resistant to p.o. and subcutaneous vitamin K.Records from Eym Medical Center suggest that the patient has factorVII deficiency. The patient had no episodes of uncontrollablebleeding or symptoms suggesting anticoagulative state.9. Endocrine: Continued the patient's home dose of Synthroid.Diabetes type 2 covered Lantus 10 units and insulin aspartsliding scale.10: Fen: Potassium/magnesium scales. cardiac ,low salt diet.11. Prophylaxis: Proton pump inhibitor , Lovenox.12. Code: The patient is DNR/DNI. There were no complications.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:Tylenol 650 mg every 4 hours by mouth , aspirin 81 mg once dailyby mouth , Dulcolax 5 mg daily by mouth for constipation , calciumcarbonate 500 mg 3 times a day by mouth , Celexa 20 mg daily , bymouth , Colace 100 mg twice a day by mouth , Nexium 20 mg daily bymouth , folate 1 mg daily by mouth , Imdur 30 mg daily by mouth ,Keppra 500 mg twice a day by mouth , Levaquin 500 mg daily x1 bymouth , Synthroid 137 mcg daily by mouth , lisinopril 5 mg daily bymouth , lithium carbonate 150 mg twice a day by mouth , Lopressor25 mg twice a day by mouth , Niferex 150 mg daily by mouth ,Nystatin ointment topical twice a day for rash , Zyprexa 2.5 mg bymouth at bedtime , Panafil spray applied topically to wound twicea day , Zocor 20 mg by mouth at bedtime , torsemide 30 mg daily bymouth , and zinc sulfate 220 mg daily by mouth.DISPOSITION:Stable.

Poorly controlled hypertension.2. Diabetes.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Fjeseth is a 62-year-old woman withcardiac risk factors of hypertension ,diabetes , a positive family history , and coronary diseasedocumented by a prior myocardial infarction who presented withincreased leg swelling , a 21 lb weight gain over the last threemonths and who was seen in Clinic on February , 1996 , by Dr.Glod , and was admitted for management. She had a myocardialinfarction in 1981 and , in September 1995 , she had a three vessel CABGwhich included a LIMA graft to the LAD and two saphenous veingrafts to the OM and to the PDA. In April 1995 , her postoperativecourse had been complicated by loculated left pleural effusionwhich required bronchoscopy and a left thoracentesis , as well as athorascopic lysis of pleural adhesions , some decortication anddrainage of effusions. At this time , she had also been dyspneic onexertion along with shortness of breath at rest. On April , 1995 ,she had an echo which showed an EF of 59% , a mildly dilated leftventricle , abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branchblock , and minimal mitral regurgitation , and mild mitralcalcification above the normal right ventricular size and function.A Bovie study was also performed and was negative. She alsopresented with some biventricular failure and diuresis wasattempted , as well as alkaloid reduction. Over the past twomonths , she had increased lower extremity edema , and she gainedapproximately 21 lb since February , 1995. She has been quiteactive and not limited. However , the edema has been her mostlimiting factor. Three nights prior to admission , she had dyspneaon exertion and some proximal maximal dyspnea , but she had no chestpain and compression boots were attempted to try to alleviate someof the edema. She had no orthopnea. She claims to have no dietaryindiscretions , no fevers , no sweats , no chills , no coughs , no chestpain , no abdominal pain , and no bright red blood per rectum , butshe was more fatigued. On February , 1996 , she was seen in Clinicby Dr. Denet and was seen to have increased leg edema andincreased dyspnea on exertion with climbing stairs. An echo wasperformed and showed decreased left ventricular function within anEF of about 40% , decreased down from an EF of 59% documented inApril 1995. Her CKs were flat an troponin I level later documented0.4 , which was negative. Echo report also showed some inferiorposterior hypokinesis , as well as significant tricuspidinsufficiency at 3.2 meters per second , which suggested PApressures of about 41 mmHg. The patient was subsequently admittedfor management of her congestive heart failure.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , status postmyocardial infarction in 1981 , hypertensionwith systolics in the 200s , which has been difficult to control ,diabetes for which she has been on insulin. She has a history ofan amaurosis fugax in September 1995 and was started on Coumadin in January1995. She has a history of the loculated pleural effusions and ahistory of TIA while being on Coumadin. She also has a history ofkidney stones.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: CABG times three in 1995 , right CEA in1993 , and right mastoid surgery.ALLERGIES: Penicillin and Ceclor which cause a rash.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Coumadin 2.5mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , insulin NPH35 units q.a.m. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Procardia XL 30 mg p.o.p.r.n. , and Slow KCl.FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for mother who had a myocardialinfarction at age 40 and 60. Father died of amyocardial infarction at age 40.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a rather obese woman ,totally edematous , who was slightly short ofbreath while talking. Her vitals were 97.3 , 64 , blood pressure211/100 , respiration rate 20 , and oxygen saturation of 96% on roomair. Her neck examination was significant for a jugular venouspulse that went up to the angle of her jaw at 30 degrees. Hercarotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally showing no bruits , but there wasa right CEA scar. Her chest examination was significant for fewcrackles at bilateral bases. Cardiac examination showed a normalS1 , S2 , but with a faint S3. Abdominal examination had a positivefluid wave , positive bowel signs , and she was tender in right upperquadrant. Extremities showed 3+ pitting edema to kneesbilaterally. DP pulse was 1+ bilaterally and femoral pulses wereunable to be palpated. Her weight , at the time of admission , was233 lb.LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values were unremarkable at the timeof admission. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm of64 , left bundle branch block , and there was no change essentiallysince September 1995. Chest x-ray , on admission , showed increasedinterstitial markings bilaterally with perhaps a slight pleuraleffusion. There was also some left lower lobe scarring and therewas an elevated left hemidiaphragm , which was consistent withincreased initial pulmonary edema.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix for thefirst three hospital days , during which she lostapproximately 17 lb. She was then switched to p.o. Lasix onhospital day four , and continued to diurese. She was placed onstrict fluid and diet restrictions throughout her stay. Her bloodpressure was controlled with a diuretic , as well as with a beta-1blocker and ACE inhibitor and a small amount of nitrate. Hercalcium blocker was discontinued while we were trying to diureseher. Her blood sugars ran low with her normal 35 units of NPHdose , so the dose was held for a couple days and she was controlledan CZI sliding scale and was resumed on 20 units of NPH. Byhospital day five , the patient was stable on the staple regimen.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 100 mgp.o. b.i.d. , NPH 20 units subcutaneousq.a.m. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.6h. ,nitroglycerin NTG 1/150 sublingual q.5 minutes times three p.r.n.chest pain , Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , KCl slow release 32 mEq p.o. b.i.d. ,ofloxacin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. times three days.COMPLICATIONS: The patient had irritation of her bladder from herFoley catheter and produced some bloody urine andthen upon discontinuing the Foley catheter had some burning of herurine for which a urinalysis was performed. She was placed onofloxacin for three days.DISPOSITION: The patient was stable upon discharge.FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow up with Dr. Mancha on January ,1996 at 12:30 p.m. during a scheduled appointment. Sheis also to follow up with Kelley Tallie , her nurse at Ver Hospital tofollow up on her blood sugar control. The patient will also have aVNA sent to see her three times a week for vital signs check ,weight medical , pharmaceutical compliance , and her weights will becalled in to Dr. Heglar She should also improve upon herphysical therapy and increase her abilities for ambulation.Dictated By: BURT BORDONARO , PDG 2Attending: KEVIN C.

GOUT.OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: On 4/25/98 , cardiac catheterization andechocardiogram.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Cliff Lucas Man Mcnease is a 52 year old Asianmale with known coronary arterydisease and extensive cardiac history , including: ( 1 ) In 1988 , thepatient had a CABG x2 vessels ( LIMA to LAD and RIMA to PDA ); ( 2 )PTCA to PDA in 1994; ( 3 ) PTCA of LAD ( proximal to LIMA and leftcircumflex ) including stent in 10/6 The patient dischargedhimself AMA at that time. ( 4 ) The patient was admitted on 10/17/98for symptoms consistent with CHF. He had a dobutamine MIBI at thattime , which was markedly positive with significant ST changes inthe inferior leads. He underwent a cardiac catheterization , wherea 90% long instant restenosis was found in the left circumflex.The area was rotablated , and then angioplastied. During theprocedure , the patient experienced episodes of asystole. A V-pacerwas placed. The pacer was D/C'd the next morning , and the patientwas discharged home on 11/17/98.Since that time , the patient states he has been pain free , exceptwhen he exercises on the treadmill. He , therefore , takes onesublingual nitroglycerin before and one after the treadmill.However , the patient now reports that he has developed rest anginaover the past two weeks. The patient states that he has q. dayrest pain , with approximately 1-3 episodes per day relieved by onesublingual nitroglycerin and lasting for minutes of each episode.On the day of admission , the patient presented to his primary caredoctor at HEH for upper respiratory infection symptoms , whichstarted approximately on 7/15/98. The patient felt chest painagain while walking up the stairs to his doctor's office. Hereported this to the doctor , and was sent to Cater Hospital for further evaluation.On presentation , he denies nausea , vomiting , or arm tingling. Hedoes report occasional shortness of breath and intermittentparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , ? no orthopnea. He sleeps with onepillow. His other review of systems was positive for productivecough over the past week , yellow phlegm , no fevers or chills ,diarrhea , or other. He was pain free in the Emergency Room. Thepatient was therefore admitted with a diagnosis of unstable anginafor further evaluation.

White count 6.37 , hematocrit 43 ,platelet count 146. CK 90 , troponin-I 0.06. His protein was 12.3 ,INR 1.1 , PTT 32.7.HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Sunier was subsequently admitted for R/O MI , andunstable angina. The patient was did R/O for MIby EKG and enzymes. He was heparinized and continued on all of hismedications that he presented on , and he was also continued onnitropaste sliding scale to keep him pain free.On hospital day #1 , the nitropaste was taken off , given that thepatient had a headache. In the evening , however , the cross-coverintern was called as the patient developed 4 out of 10 chest painwith deep breathing , which the patient stated felt like his typicalangina. Therefore , the nitropaste was restarted and the patientwas pain free within approximately two minutes.The patient underwent an echocardiogram on hospital day #2 , whichshowed an EF of 60-65% , 1+ MR , and borderline inferior hypokinesis.He had an ETT MIBI done on 9/17/98. He exercise approximately 9minutes and 45 seconds and stopped secondary to his chest pain andfatigue. His peak heart rate was 89 , and BP 170/98. He hadhorizontal downsloping of 1 mm , ST depression in the inferior leadsand V5-V6 , which was persistent in recovery. He got one sublingualnitroglycerin given. On the images , it showed: ( 1 ) Moderate tosevere ischemia of the inferior wall and the posterior septum ( RCA )7 out of 20 segments; ( 2 ) Mild ischemia of the anterior wall andseptum ( LAD ) 4 out of 20 segments; ( 3 ) An EF of 59%. The patientwas continued on heparin , nitropaste , and aspirin , and was sent forcardiac catheterization on hospital day #3. Cardiaccatheterization showed: ( 1 ) A left main which was okay;( 2 ) Totally occluded RCA; ( 3 ) Totally occluded LAD after the D1;( 4 ) His left circ was 30-40% with a mid instant occlusion; ( 5 ) LIMAto LAD was patent; ( 6 ) A treated LIMA , gaze TNG arrow patent;( 7 ) Status post RIMA PTCA/stenting with significant spasm of theentire RIMA.

The patient was continued to be monitored.Her blood pressure was followed. Patient was kept on Coumadin.Patient was scheduled for an open air MRI , given her significantsize. Patient was scheduled for an open MRI at the MRI inWell Deh Ny On 3 of August , patient underwent MRI with particularinterest in visualization of the posterior fossa. No acute infarctor hemorrhage was noted on MRI MRA. The patient was continued onher Coumadin. Coumadin had been increased from admission dose of17 mg to 18 mg p.o. q.p.m. Initially , her INR went down slightlyon 3 of August to 1.7 , likely secondary to a missed dose earlier in theweek. On 17 of July , patient reported feeling back to her baseline ofone week ago. Patient denied any new symptoms. Patient deniedfurther imbalance or vertical diplopia. Patient was thought tohave had a likely small vessel cerebral infarct and , although nostroke was demonstrated on MRI , involvement of patient's left sidesuggested a cerebral lesion in the brain stem in order to explainthe diplopia.

Shehas been complaining of chest pain and pressure on exertion as wellas dyspnea on exertion associated with limitation of activity andincreasing sublingual nitroglycerin use for the six to seven monthsprior to admission. Of note , the patient developed atrialfibrillation , atrial flutter back in October , 1995. Anechocardiogram at that time demonstrated an ejection fraction of40% , inferior hypokinesis , moderate mitral regurgitation , and aleft atrial size of 6.1 centimeters. The patient requiredhospitalization in October , 1996 , for congestive heart failure. Shereturned to the hospital in February , 1996 , with complaints of chestpain at rest and shortness of breath. She was ruled out formyocardial infarction at Tol Hospital and transferred toAna Vinerl Hospital , where she refused cardiaccatheterization. Echocardiogram at that time demonstrated anejection fraction of 45% , inferior , posterior and anterior septalhypokinesis , mild to moderate mitral stenosis and moderate mitralregurgitation. Again , there was left atrial enlargement measuredat 6.1 centimeters. The patient returned home and was doing welluntil February , 1996 , when she developed headache , chest pain andshortness of breath. She again presented to Beth's Community Memorial Hospital whereshe was found to be in acute pulmonary edema. She was stabilizedand transferred to Crithouse County Medical Center for furthermanagement.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease ,status post anterior myocardial infarction.Mitral regurgitation. Mitral stenosis. Atrial fibrillation.Hypertension. Hypothyroidism. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.Peptic ulcer disease. Normocytic anemia. Polymyalgia rheumatica.History of left humeral fracture. She is status post appendectomy ,cholecystectomy , and laser therapy for retinal disease of the righteye.ALLERGIES: Erythromycin , which causes vomiting and hypertension ,as well as to sulfa drugs which cause vomiting. Shehas a possible allergy to penicillin as well.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Synthroid 100 micrograms p.o. q.d.;Lasix 40 milligrams p.o. q.d.; Axid 150milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; aspirin 325 milligrams p.o. q.d.;prednisone 5 milligrams p.o. q.d.; digoxin 0.125 milligrams p.o.q.d.; Vasotec 5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d.; Zocor 10 milligrams p.o.q.d.; Lopressor 25 milligrams p.o. q.i.d.; Isordil 10 milligramsp.o. t.i.d.; Coumadin alternating 1 and 2 milligrams q.d. Ontransfer , the patient was also on intravenous heparin andNitropaste.SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and retired. She has no smokingor alcohol history.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is in atrial fibrillation at a rate of83. Her blood pressure is 100/60 and is 95%on room air. HEENT: Significant for upper and lower dentureswithout any oropharyngeal lesions. NECK: Supple with 2+ carotidpulses and no bruits. LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIOVASCULAR:Irregularly irregular rate and rhythm. Normal S1/S2. III/VIholosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. ABDOMEN:Soft , nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis , clubbingor edema. There are varicosities in bilateral lower extremitieswith minimal varicosities over the thigh areas. There is bilateralknee swelling. Pedal pulses are 1+ bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL:Nonfocal.LABORATORY DATA: BUN is 35 , creatinine 1.5. White blood cell count8.3. Hematocrit 32. PT 11.9 , PTT 28.4.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Jeffganlanda Py Docweli Skiffle Community Hospital Cardiology Service , where shewas maximized medically. The patient underwent cardiaccatheterization on January , 1996 , where she was noted to haveright coronary artery stenosis in the mid portion which was 50% anddistally had 80%. Finally , 90% with subtotal occlusion after theposterior descending artery. The left anterior descending arteryhad 40% stenosis after diagonal 1. Diagonal 1 itself had 90%stenosis in the mid portion. The left circumflex had a 70%stenosis at the mid portion and another 70% stenotic area at thedistal portion. Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimatedat 45%. Inferior hypokinesis was noted as was 3-4+ mitralregurgitation. Right atrial pressures were 6 , right ventricle was52/10 , pulmonary artery 52/22 , with mean of 33 , pulmonary capillarywedge pressure was 27 and left ventricle was 160/16. The patientwas evaluated by the Cardiac Surgical Service for coronary arterybypass grafting and replacement of her mitral valve. On March , 1996 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room where sheunderwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four with saphenousvein graft to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft toobtuse marginal one , saphenous vein graft to left anteriordescending artery , diagonal one and to left anterior descendingartery. She also had mitral valve replacement with 31 millimeterHancock. The patient tolerated the procedure well and wastransferred postoperatively to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit onnitroglycerin , Dopamine drip. She was weaned to extubate withoutdifficulty. She was restarted on Captopril and digoxin as well asCoumadin. The patient had minimal response to diuretics ,associated with a rise in her creatinine to 1.9. The Captopril wasdiscontinued and the creatinine returned again to 1.3. Althoughthe chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions , thepatient did not require aggressive diuresis initially as she hadexcellent oxygenation on room air. Of note the patient was notrestarted on Lopressor as her blood pressures remained in the90-100 range. The patient was , however , started on her prednisoneat 5 milligrams p.o. q.d. as well as on her Synthroid. Chest tubesand invasive monitoring were discontinued early in the patient'shospital course and she was transferred to the floor onpostoperative day number four. The patient was followed byphysical therapy and occupational therapy for progression of hermobility. She was determined to benefit from intensiverehabilitation at a facility.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was ambulating withassistance. She was tolerating a regulardiet. She was seen to be in atrial fibrillation but ventricularresponse was well controlled in the 60s to 70s. Of note , herelectrocardiogram demonstrated persistent right bundle branch blockas well as a left anterior fascicular block. Although the patienthad been receiving more than her normal doses of Coumadin , her INRhad not reached the therapeutic range. She was , however ,therapeutic on heparin.DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to a facility forintensive conditioning and rehabilitation. There shewill continue to receive her heparin until she is therapeutic onher Coumadin. Coumadin dosing will be handled by primary caredoctor , Dr. Corey Updegraff , or a physician at the rehabilitationcenter. Dr. Turks 's number is 250-940-9571. The goal INR is 2to 2.5. The patient will also require follow-up chest x-rays asprior to discharge , her chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleuraleffusions which were small and were not compromising herrespiration at all.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3 one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h.p.r.n. pain; digoxin 0.125 milligrams p.o.q.d.; Colace 100 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. while taking Tylenol #3;Lasix 80 milligrams p.o. q.d. to be continued initially but may bediscontinued at the discretion of the primary care or cardiologyphysicians , pending the resolution of the pleural effusions and herrespiratory status; Synthroid 150 micrograms p.o. q.d.

The patient has an extensive past medical historyof hypercholesterolemia , chronic renal insufficiency , insulindependent diabetes , coronary artery disease status post multipleMI , CABG , hypertension , degenerative joint disease , CVA , gout ,schizoaffective disorder , tardive dyskinesia and hypothyroidism.At her baseline she has been staying at the Wrangcon Ronhomar Memorial Hospital and onadmission was complaining of chest pressure since waking , similarto the pressure she felt during a prior admission. She had acertain amount of shortness of breath , some nausea , two episodesof vomiting and her symptoms were not responsive to nitroglycerintablets at the Harpa Vensports Center The patient came to the Ter Health Emergency Department where she reported that herchest pressure had resolved. She was treated with IV TNG. Inthe Emergency Department she was also treated with Lopressor ,aspirin , IV trinitroglycerin and was heparinized. The patientthen pulled out the lines. Her admission vitals were significantfor a blood pressure of 180/90. The patient had a heart rate of86 , was afebrile and was breathing at 100% at 2 liters. She hadan elevated JVP , had clear sounding lungs , trace edema and at theleft upper sternal border and left lower sternal border asystolic ejection murmur II-III/VI was heard with S1 and S2.Admission labs were significant for an elevated creatinine of2.0. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient had elevatedplatelets from a baseline of 30 to 80 to 673 on admission , awhite count of 9.3 , hematocrit of 35. EKG was notable for a Q3which had been seen on a prior EKG. T-wave inversions also seenon a prior EKG. The patient had an echo on 7/4 which showedconcentric LVH with an EF of 30-35% , posterolateral and inferiorakinesis was also seen. A calcified aortic valve with trace AIand mild MR was seen. On 10/19 , the patient had catheterizationwhich showed that her circulation was right dominant with an LAD90% and 100% lesions , left circumflex with 100% lesion , RCA with100% lesions. She had an SVG to PDA graft with 100% lesion , SVGto circumflex graft with 85% lesion stented to 10% at that time.She had a LIMA to LAD graft which was patent , and she had lots ofcollaterals. The right heart cath was significant for a wedge of39 and a PA of 75/34 and right atrial pressure of 14 and acardiac index of 1.7.HOSPITAL COURSE: By system ,1. Ischemia: The patient was initially treated with aspirin ,beta blockers , statin , Plavix , Heparinized and was ruled out withenzymes. On the first day of hospitalizations , the patient'sheparin was stopped , the patient's IV trinitroglycerin wasstopped as well. The patient was started on nadolol and thatdose was increased to 80 q.day which the patient tolerated welland seemed to control the patient's blood pressure and heart ratereasonably well. The patient's attending felt that the patientwas a poor candidate for catheterization and other interventionsand would not benefit significantly from it. The symptoms thepatient was having was similar she was having during a priorhospitalization which had ended just two days before thisadmission. It was felt that her nausea , vomiting and chestpressure were probably noncardiac in nature. The only change inthe patient's cardiac medications at the time of discharge is anincrease in nadolol to 80 mg q.day.Rhythm: The patient's rhythm was monitored on telemetry for mostof her stay during this hospitalization. Significant events werenot observed.Pump: The patient was continued at her regular dose ofoutpatient medications which seemed to be effective. The patienthad multiple complaints of chest pain/pressure during herhospitalization which resulted in periodic examinations and EKGs.All of these workups were negative.2. GI: On 10/26 it was noted that the patient had an increasedwhite count of 16 , 000. Also on exam on that day it was notedthat the patient had marked right upper quadrant abdominaltenderness and fullness. She was not tender anywhere else in herabdomen. Abdominal exam was also significant for a central massrepresenting an umbilical hernia. At that time , General Surgeryconsult was called. Lipase and amylase were sent off. They werenegative. Liver function tests were also in the normal range atthat time. Surgery felt that the patient was a poor surgicalcandidate given her comorbidities at that time but did recommenda cholecystectomy in the future. They recommended initialantibiotic course of amp , Levo and Flagyl which she was startedon. They also recommended making the patient NPO treated herwith Pepcid and giving her adequate IV hydration. The majorintervention they suggested was a cholecystectomy tube byInterventional Radiology which was placed on the night of3/16/04. On 9/24 , the patient's white count was down to 10 witha Tmax of 100 , and at the time of discharge the patient had awhite count in the normal range around 7 and was also afebrile.Surgery followed the patient during her stay in the hospital asdid Interventional Radiology. Bile was sent out for culturewhich showed yeast as well as a gram stain which showed grampositive cocci. The patient's antibiotics were switched toVancomycin , Levo and Flagyl. Initially the Vancomycin and Flagylwere given IV and the Levo was given p.o. One day prior todischarge , the patient's Flagyl was switched to p.o. and on theday of discharge the Vancomycin was stopped after the patient hadreceived seven days of Vancomycin. The patient will bedischarged on Flagyl p.o. and Levo p.o. The patient was alsostarted no Fluconazole 100 to treat the yeast that was noted inher bile cultures. The IR drain will need to be in the patient'sgallbladder for a minimum of six weeks or until the patient hasher elective cholecystectomy which will be scheduled at a laterdate.3. ID: The patient is colonized with MRSA and appropriateprecautions were taken and the patient was also noted to have aninfection in her gallbladder and was treated for it as such.4. Pain: The patient was treated for abdominal pain during herstay in the hospital with Demerol and also with Morphine.5. Psychiatry: The patient was seen by Psychiatry on admissionto help manage her agitation and delirium. They did apreliminary assessment of the patient. The patient did showcertain signs of agitation and multiple code grays had to becalled on the patient for difficult behavior , though the patientwas never in danger of truly hurting herself or others.ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac chest pain.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis now resolved.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: ASA 325 , Colace 100 b.i.d. , Lasix 80b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Levoxyl 175 , nadolol 80 , Lipitor80 q.h.s. , Lantis 18 units , Diovan 80 , levofloxacin 500 every 24hours to complete a 14 day course , Fluconazole 100 to complete a14 day course , Flagyl 500 t.i.d. to complete a 14 day course ,Plavix 75 , famotidine 20 b.i.d. , iron 325 q.day.eScription document: 0-5350071 DBSSten TelCC: Markus Scrogham M.D.Ca Xand RoclearriSDictated By: HOGON , CLETUSAttending: REYNOSO , SONNY RONNYDictation ID 6696435D: 10/18/04T: 10/18/04

CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.CHIEF COMPLAINT: DYSPNEA ON EXERTION.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Cabaniss is a 70-year-old woman witha history of yellow nail syndrome ,hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes ,who has had multiple admissions since October 2001. The first wasan admission to an outside hospital from 5/25/01 - 11/20/01.At that time , she had increased shortness of breath , and wasdiagnosed with bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardialeffusion. She had a pericardial window and 600 cc were drainedfrom her pericardium , as well as pleural effusions drained. Shewas discharged at that time with a diagnosis of congestive heartfailure , secondary to cor pulmonale. The second admission wasfrom 8/28/01 - 8/10/01 at the Aen Medical Center . At that time , she hadincreased lower extremity edema. She was diuresed during thatadmission , and again her pleural effusions were tapped. Anechocardiogram at that time revealed mild LVH , an ejection fractionof 55-60% , no wall motion abnormalities and a moderate-largepericardial effusion with fibrinous strands.A catheterization of her left and right heart revealed a rightatrial pressure of 5 , an RV pressure of 45/11 , PA pressures of38/18 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , LV pressurewas 127/14. There was no constrictive pericardial disease orrestrictive cardiomyopathy. She also had no malignant cells in herpleural effusion , which was exudated. ANCA , ANA , SPEP werenegative. She also had a renal ultrasound that was without mass orhydronephrosis , 24 hour urine collection with decreased protein.The third admission was at Beysa Dward Hospital from 11/15/01 - 1/16/01 , forincreasing shortness of breath and increasing lower extremityedema. At that time she was diuresed , found to be iron deficient.She had bilateral thoracentesis , which revealed exudativeeffusions. PFTs revealed a FEV1 of .9 , 40% of predicted , an FVC of1.26 , 43% of predicted , an FEV1/FVC ratio of 93% , a TLC of 2.07 ,40% of predicted , and a DLCO of 8.42 , also 40% of predicted. Shewas ruled out for TB with serial ASBs during this admission.She was also diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome at that time ,consisting of the clinical syndrome of recurrent pleural effusions ,lymphedema and yellow fingernails. She was started on high doseVitamin E , and evaluated by CT surgery for a possible pleurodesis.However , she was sent home at that time with an increased dose ofdiuretics.Since her discharge in July , she has been aggressively diuresed ,but the diuretics were stopped secondary to hyperkalemia. In September2001 , she was found to have a 10 pound weight gain and wasrestarted on Lasix. Over the week prior to admission , she has hadincreasing dyspnea on exertion. She has baseline shortness ofbreath and orthopnea , but her orthopnea has also worsened. Herweight at discharge in July was 208 , and on admission shecurrently weighs 238 , and was 231 pounds a month prior toadmission. She denies wheezing , but does have a chronic cough withwhite sputum. She has had some substernal chest pain that is sharpwith dyspnea on exertion , which lasts for awhile without radiation.She also has increasing lower extremity edema. In the emergencydepartment , she was found to be afebrile , heart rate 103 ,respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure 95/41 and satting 91% on 2liters.

She was admitted withincreasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and a weight gain overthe past week prior to admission. She has most likely had afailure of home diuretics , and needed to have her effusions tappedalong with some definitive therapy for her yellow nail syndrome interms of recurrent pleural effusions.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Pulmonary. We initially diuresed Ms. Jowellwith IV Lasix , along with Diuril. She had briskdiuresis overnight , but was still short of breath the next day. Onhospital day #2 , we did a thoracentesis on her right side and wereable to remove 1.5 liters of clear , yellowish fluid. The fluid wassent for cytology , as well as chemistries and returned as anexudative effusion with predominant lymphocytes. The cytology wasnegative for any malignant cells. The pulmonary team wasconsulted , who decided that she would benefit from a pleurodesis toprevent effusions from recurring. We consulted thoracic surgery ,who requested a CT scan after a thoracentesis to assess her lungsfor evidence of malignancy.CT scan was done on 9/19/01 , but due to atelectasis and having todo the study without IV contrast , there were areas in her right andleft lungs that appeared nodular or opacified and could have beenmalignancies. CT surgery also requested cardiac clearance beforeany definitive surgical therapy was done due to new onset SVT. We obtained astress MIBI. On 9/4/01 , she was taken to the operating room for surgeryof the right chest. At that time , Dr. Women , the cardiothoracicsurgeon took biopsies of her pleura , which were reportedlythickened and yellow. She also took a wedge biopsy of the rightlower lobe. Those biopsies have returned , and revealed mildnonspecific interstitial pneumonitis with chronic bronchiolitis.The diaphragm was also biopsied , and was determined to be lymphoidtissue in a fibrous tissue fragment. She had a chest tube placedat the time of operation and tolerated that well. However , after thatprocedure , she was deemed unstable by the PACU team and wasadmitted to MICU overnight. She extubated without problems andremained on a few liters of oxygen overnight , with oxygensaturations in the 90%. She was readmitted to the medicine teamon the following day , 8/28/01. Overall , she tolerated thatprocedure well. Her chest tube that was placed on the right sidedid not drain much fluid over the next few days. However , thepleural effusion on the left side , did increase in size and we dida thoracentesis on 8/28/01. We removed 1 liter of turbid ,yellowish brown fluid. The chemistries revealed a lymphocyte andmacrophage predominance and the cytology is still pending at thistime. As her chest tube was not draining much fluid , the thoracicsurgery team decided to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which hasshown to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient's 70% ofthe time. The pleurodesis was on 3/29/01. She tolerated thisprocedure well , and had little chest tube drainage over the next 48hours. The chest tube was pulled on 6/2/01.Mrs. Musson 's shortness of breath was much improved after theinitial thoracentesis on the right , and she is currently on herhome oxygen requirement of 2 liters , satting in the mid-90%. Theplan is for her to see Dr. Colasante in 2 weeks and also have afollow-up chest x-ray. At that time , Dr. Ostermann will determine ifthere is fluid reaccumulating on the right after the pleurodesis.She can then have a repeat pleurodesis on the right , or an initialpleurodesis on the left.2. Cardiovascular. Mrs. Blan was tachycardic on admission , andcontinued to be tachycardic throughout the admission. She wasinitially diuresed with IV Lasix and Diuril , and was probably overdiuresed , a total of 2-3 liters over a number of hours overnight.On hospital day #2 , she was found to be tachycardic with rates inthe 140s-150s and atrial fibrillation. She converted back tonormal sinus rhythm with 3 doses of IV calcium channel blockers anda Diltiazem drip. She was then maintained on Diltiazem SR 60 mg POb.i.d. throughout the admission and remained in normal sinusrhythm. However , her tachycardia was noted to be multifocal HLtachycardia during her MICU admission. At the time of admission ,we did a pulsus which was only 8 mmhg. She had a bedsideechocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which revealed atrace pericardial effusion. She also had a dobutamine MIBI forcardiac clearance for the cardiothoracic surgical procedure. Herheart rate increased from 107-129 , and the blood pressure decreasedfrom 115/70 - 110/70 at peak stress. The clinical response todobutamine was non-ischemic , the blood pressure response wasnormal , and the EKG response to dobutamine was non-ischemic. Therewere no definite regional perfusion defects seen on the stress orrest images. However , only planer images could be obtained , due todifficulty with positioning of the patient's left arm. Her resultswere determined to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence ofhemodynamically secondary CAD , although the study was technicallylimited.In terms of her diuresis , Ms. Duensing was kept on IV Lasix for onlythe first few days of her admission , and then was switched to POdiuretics. Initially at a dose of 200 mg PO b.i.d. , and thendecreased to 120 mg PO b.i.d. Her lower extremity edema decreasedsignificantly , along with her pleural effusions.3. Renal. Ms. Handy 's baseline creatinine is 1.7 , her creatininethroughout her admission varied between 1.6-1.9. We caused a mildcontraction alkalosis with diuretics , but were able to replete herelectrolytes as needed. She will follow with Dr. Svinth for herrenal insufficiency as an outpatient.4. Endocrine. Ms. Reppell has type II diabetes and was on glyburide5 mg q. d. as an outpatient. She continued that therapy as aninpatient , and her finger sticks were in good control during thisadmission.5. Rheumatology. Ms. Chad has a history of gout , and we wereconcerned about precipitating a gout attack with the aggressivediuresis. We continued her colchicine and decreased herallopurinol to 200 mg PO q. d. We also continued her Vitamin Etherapy for the yellow nail syndrome.6. Hematology. She has chronic anemia , and we continued her ironand Procrit treatment during the admission.DISPOSITION: Ms. Souza will be discharged to home with VNAservices to administer her twice weekly Procrit doses , and physicaltherapy to aid her in regain her strength and range of motion inher joints infected with gout. She has been instructed to makefollow-up appointments with Dr. Amicone in a few weeks , and to havea chest x-ray on the day that she sees Dr. Burchell She should alsofollow-up with Dr. Donkin in the renal clinic.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.

At the outside hospital , she was noted to befebrile with temperature 39.8 and noted on EKG to have STelevations in the inferior leads. The patient was med-flightedto Hasey Health Care for an emergent cath. The patient had 70%LAD lesion , 50% proximal RCA , and 90% mid RCA lesion that wasstented to 0% , and a 60% PDA lesion , and LVEDP of 33 on initialcath. Started on Integrilin post cath and transferred to CCU.The patient did well in the CCU and was transferred out on thenext day. Previous to admission , the patient resided in aassisted living facility and was fairly active but has hadincreasing dyspnea on exertion , decreasing exercise toleranceover the past six months.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature was 98.8 , heartrate was in the 70s , BP was 120s/60s , respirations was 22 ,saturation was 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula. Generally , she isan obese female in mild distress. Some cough. Her HEENT examshowed a clear oropharynx. No erythema or injection. Skin hadno rashes or other lesions. Neck was supple with full range ofmotion. JVP was approximately 2 with 2+ carotid pulses withoutbruits. No thyromegaly or nodules. Chest was noted to havediffuse wheezing with bilateral bibasilar crackles. Questionableright-sided consolidation , PMI nondisplaced with a regular rateand rhythm with S4 , S1 with physiologically split S2. Nosignificant murmurs or rubs. Abdomen was nondistended andnontender. Positive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. Herextremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. 2+ femoral ,DP , and PT pulses. Neurologically , she was alert and orientedwith normal mental status and nonfocal exam. Her chest x-rayshowed evidence of pulmonary edema with focal consolidation ofright upper lobe with chest consistent with pneumonia. Her EKGon admission , was normal sinus rhythm in the 60s with normal axisand inferior Q waves with T-wave inversions inferiorly andlaterally.IMPRESSION: This is a 77-year-old female status post IMI withconcurrent COPD exacerbation secondary to probable right upperlobe pneumonia.HOSPIATL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular: The patient did very well status postrevascularization. She did have some persistent pain while inthe intensive care unit and this went away on transfer to thefloor. She was medically optimized and continued on aspirin andPlavix , added a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor to the patient's1B pump. The patient had compensated heart function ondischarge , euvolemic , but she did require intermittent Lasix.She was discharged on Lasix to treat heart failure. Rhythm-wise ,the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the courseof hospitalization.2. Pulmonary: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbationwith a rapid prednisone taper , and her home nebulizers , and a10-day course of levofloxacin. Incidentally , the patient alsoadmitted to having a TB exposure. We placed a TB and that wasnonreactive and had induced sputums that were negative x 3.3. Renal: The patient had well preserved renal functionnormalized at discharge.4. FEN: The patient was tolerating oral diet well and wasindicated on her instructions that she should have low-calorie ,low-fat , low-cholesterol diet particularly given her diabetes andshe should watch her sugar and was maintained on her own.5.

More recently , superficial bladder cancer whichwas treated with partial resection. He developed hematuriaapproximately April 1995. A workup revealed hemorrhagic cystitiswhich was felt to be secondary to prior radiation treatments. Hehas required approximately 1 unit of red cells per week for thepast three months to keep up with ongoing urologic blood loss.The patient has no known cardiac history. His risk factors includediabetes , hypertension , tobacco use , and male sex. No history ofhypercholesterolemia or family history. He describes 4-5 episodesof chest tightness occurring over the past five years , the lastepisode occurring approximately three months ago. He does noteprogressive pedal edema over the past six weeks and over the pasttwo to three days has had increasing fatigue and dyspnea onexertion. On the day prior to admission , routine VNA blood drawrevealed a hematocrit of 17. His primary care physician wasnotified and the patient was instructed to report to Fiville Gadelp Medical Center on the day of admission for transfusion. Repeathematocrit on the day of admission was 18. He received two unitsof packed red cells and chemotherapy infusion and shortly aftertransfusion developed shortness of breath without chest pain.Chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure. Hisinitial CK was 770 with 70 MB fraction. The patient wastransferred to the Emergency Room for further evaluation where hewas treated with topical Nitro paste , 40 mg of IV Lasix , resultingin 1500 cc of urine output. Aspirin and heparin were heldsecondary to hemorrhagic cystitis. Beta blocker was also heldsecondary to question of bronchospasm.The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit forfurther treatment.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. AODM. 2. Peripheral vascular disease.3. Neuropathy. 4. Prostate cancer. 5.Bladder cancer in 1995 and 1990. 6. Status post appendectomy. 7.History of TIAs three to four years ago. Workup revealed 50%bilateral carotid stenosis. 8. Chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease. 9. Hypertension.ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes edema.

Temperature 98.6 , bloodpressure 110/62 , heart rate 98. Oxygen saturation of 97% on 2liters. HEENT: Examination is benign , no JVD , JVP was at 7 cm ,neck was supple. CHEST: Bibasilar crackles. CARDIAC: 2+carotids , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , rubs , orgallops. ABDOMEN: Two frontal scars , liver was palpable 2 cmbelow the right costal margin. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,nondistended , normal bowel sounds , no masses. BACK: No CVA orspinal tenderness. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in the Emergency Room.EXTREMITIES: 1+ left greater than right pedal edema. Superficialulcers on bilateral soles. NEURO: Alert and oriented times three.Nonfocal.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 132 , potassium 4.7 , chloride96 , bicarb 25 , BUN 7 , creatinine0.9 , glucose 186 , CK of 776 , MB 70.5. LFTs were within normallimits. Hematocrit was 28.3 , white count 10.4 , platelet count 283 ,PT 13.5 , PTT 26.2 , normal differential.Urinalysis grossly bloody , 10-20 white cells.Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure with small bilateraleffusions , right greater than left , plus Kerley B-lines.EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 90 , intervals 212/72/368 , and axis 7degrees. No ischemic changes.ASSESSMENT & PLAN: This is a 69 year old gentleman with multiplecardiac risk factors , chronic anemia secondaryto severe hemorrhagic cystitis , no transfusion dependent , who wasadmitted with congestive heart failure after blood transfusion andpositive CK , MB. No definitive EKG changes and no clear history ofangina but recent history of increased pedal edema. The patientlikely had recent myocardial infarction and congestive heartfailure in the setting of transfusion.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unitfor further care. As mentioned above , heparinand aspirin were held secondary to the risk of worseninghemorrhagic cystitis. The patient received further bloodtransfusions to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30. He remainedin the Cardiac Care Unit overnight. Serial CKs revealed an A setof 776 ( MB 70.5 ) , B set 747 ( MB 54.7 ) , C set 564 ( MB 33.2 ). CTNIwas 25.1. EKG's were without evolution. The patient was thereforeruled in for a non Q-wave myocardial infarction. An echocardiogramwas performed on 4/17/96 which showed normal LV function , mild LVH ,no regional wall motion abnormalities but of a somewhat suboptimalquality. The patient received a total of four units of red bloodcells with a subsequent rise in hematocrit from 17 to 30.1 by thefirst hospital day and received initially 40 mg of IV Lasix in theEmergency Room , followed by two doses of 20 mg with excellent urineoutput.The patient was transferred from the CCU to General MedicalService , Scogard on his second hospital day , 9/23/96. His post MIcourse was uncomplicated , notable only for two runs ofnon-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight on the firsthospital day. The patient had no recurrent angina and no recurrentevidence of congestive heart failure.He underwent a routine post MI submax ETT on 9/3/96. The patientwent 4 minutes and 4 seconds with a peak work load of 31 , peakheart rate of 80 , and peak blood pressure of 160/80. He stoppedsecondary to fatigue. He occasional PVC's but no chest pain and noST changes. The test was thought to show no evidence of ischemiabut had a low work load. It was thought appropriate to dischargethe patient to home for further medical management and furtherurologic workup as an outpatient. The most important medicalintervention would be to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 withvigilant monitoring. During this admission , the patient received atotal of six units of packed red cells. and had a hematocrit of30.9 on discharge.From a urologic standpoint , the patient was followed by Urologyduring his hospitalization , who felt that his condition wassecondary to radiation cystitis. Given that he was now havinghematuria to the extent of requiring frequent transfusions , surgeryi.e. a urinary diversion with ileal conduit , will most likely benecessary in the near future. He will continue to follow-up withUrology as an outpatient.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ferrous sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , folicacid 1 mg p.o. q.day , Glyburide 10 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , sublingual nitroglycerinp.r.n. chest pain.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in goodcondition and will follow-up with Dr. Arthur Matney and also with Dr. Silos as well as Urology.Dictated By: NAPOLEON T.

He had been seen by Vascular Surgery fivedays prior to admission and had been started on dicloxacillin fora third episode of cellulitis. He had also presented with fluidoverload and spironolactone was added to his diuretic regimen.His primary care provider saw him the day prior to admission , andthe patient reported a recent fall and the primary care physicianrecommended admission to the hospital. The patient does reportsome fever and shaking chills and decreased appetite. Also ,reported weakness in bilateral lower extremities and right footpain. He has chronic loss of sensation in both feet.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Morbid obesity , type II diabetes , chronic renal insufficiencywith a baseline creatinine of 2-2.5 , dyslipidemia , hypertension ,coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease , anemia ,history of deep vein thrombosis , obstructive sleep apnea , angerdisorder , peptic ulcer disease , and tinea pedis.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Atenolol 100 mg q.d. , spironolactone , torsemide 160 mg b.i.d. ,Hyzaar 50/12.5 q. day , lisinopril 60 mg q. day , Neurontin 1200 mgt.i.d. , Norvasc 10 mg q.a.m. and 5 mg q.p.m. , Coumadin 8 mg ,aspirin , Humalog sliding scale , Percocet , Pletal 100 mg b.i.d. ,Procrit , Zantac , nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and NPH 80 q.a.m. andq.p.m.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:On physical exam , the patient was afebrile and had a temperatureof 99 , a heart rate of 70 , blood pressure 200/79 possibly takenwith an undersized cuff , 18 and 99% on room air. He is obese andcomfortable man in bed and in no acute distress. His JVP couldnot be assessed from the size of his neck. Heart sounds weredistant. Chest was clear. His abdomen is obese with bowelsounds , nontender , and nondistended. Extremities: Notable for 3+edema , and including 1+ extending to the groin. His pulses wereDopplerable bilaterally with a triphasic wave on the right andbiphasic on the left. The medial aspect of his right leg had asurgical scar. A healed annular burn wound in the medial kneeand an area of erythema along the scar with warmth , moderatetenderness , no fluctuance and minimal induration , no discharge.The diameter of his right leg was greater than his left. Hisright heel had an intact ??blough?? and his left heel had a drypressure sore. His right big toe was tender to palpation.LABORATORY STUDIES:Labs were notable for a creatinine of 3.4 and an INR of 7.1. HisEKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 75.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:Problem #1. Infectious Disease: The patient was started onvancomycin IV on admission for his right medial thigh cellulitisat the site of the femoropopliteal bypass with rapiddefervescence and improvement. No drainage , no fluctuance.Additional antibiotic coverage was added specifically offluoroquinolone for anti-psuedomonal coverage for his diabeticfoot ulcers. The right heel also looked increasingly purulentduring his hospitalization and bilateral foot plain films weredone. These were negative for osteomyelitis but showed a metalsliver in the right foot and an acute fracture of the firstmetatarsal. Surgical debridement was done in the operating roomwith drainage of pus , but the metal showed could not be locatedeven with fluoroscopy. The patient will complete a 14-day courseof levofloxacin and clindamycin for these foot ulcers , and willbe discharged home with visiting nursing care for b.i.d.wet-to-dry dressing changes. He will follow up with Jerold Cristopher Blazon , M.D. in one to two weeks.Problem #2. Renal: The patient was volume overloaded onadmission. His torsemide was changed to IV and metolazone wasadded and was given 30 minutes prior to his first torsemide doseof the day. A diuresis of 1.5-2 liters a day was achieved withthis regimen with the exception of a 4 liter diuresis overnighton the first day of admission. His electrolytes were replaced asneeded. I have expected his creatinine increase to 4.5 bydischarge. He will need close renal follow ups as he may beapproaching need for dialysis. The Renal Service followed himduring this hospitalization and at their recommendation ,spironolactone will be discontinued upon discharge since hisdiuresis will be slowed.Problem #3. Vascular: Diuresis was essential for resolution ofhis cellulitis. Pletal was continued and because of his severeperipheral arterial disease , he will require excellent wound careto optimize healing.Problem #4. Heme: Initially , his Coumadin was held for asupratherapeutic INR. This was restarted when his INR was 2.2and he his now in the therapeutic range and will need to befollowed.Problem #5. Cardiovascular: He was hypertensive on arrivalwhich was treated with Hydralazine initially and transitioned tohis p.o. home medicines. Even with a large cuff , his bloodpressure continued to run high in the 150s-180s. On hospital day#9 , Hydralazine p.o. was added with good effect which lowered hissystolic blood pressure to the range of the 120s-130s. Goal isbelow 130/80.Problem #6. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with NPH andHumalog. The Diabetes Service saw the patient and at theirrecommendation NPH doses were increased , and he is now on 90units in the morning and 85 units at night. The goal for thispatient is below 150 particularly given the need for woundhealing.Problem #7: GI: The patient was seen by Nutrition and will beevaluated as an outpatient by Bariatric Surgery pending nextweek. This is of utmost importance for this patient withlife-threatening morbid obesity who already has severecomplications of obesity-related conditions. The patient hasobesity , hyperventilation syndrome.Problem #8. Pulmonary: The patient has obstructive sleep apnea.A CPAP machine was brought to the patient bedside , but thepatient was unable to tolerate the nose mask. He will use hisown device when he returns home.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:He will go home with visiting nurse care and will need to see hisnephrologist , vascular surgeons , primary care provider , andBariatric Surgery following discharge.eScription document: 3-5081947 EMSSten TelDictated By: GREIBER , JORDONAttending: BARTOSIK , RICK ARMANDDictation ID 3091355D: 8/7/03T: 8/7/03

His cardiac history began in 26 of September , when hesuffered a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. A cardiaccatheterization at that time revealed a 90% proximal left anteriordescending lesion with anterolateral akinesis , which was treatedwith angioplasty. He had a limited stress test on 18 of July , whichwas limited by symptoms of chest pressure. The electrocardiogramand thallium done at that time were both unrevealing. The patientwas involved in a motor vehicle accident in July , and then againin January , 1991. He suffered multiple contusions , but no fractures.Subsequent to the accidents , however , he described having leftflank and left side pain , which was exacerbated by movement and wasassociated with the development of his left substernal chestpressure. Nitroglycerin did seem to provide him some relief. Thepatient was seen recently at Laclare's Bouldwalt in Rockoxsiford Au for chestdiscomfort , and electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes did not showany evidence of myocardial infarction. The patient has continuedto complain of chest discomfort over the past month , but allelectrocardiograms have been negative. An exercise tolerance testwas performed at Tygib Haysbonne Valley Hospital , which was positive forchest discomfort and for ST depressions in the inferolateral leads.Thallium examination was not performed because of infiltration ofthe intravenous access. He was transferred from Jacklip on 22 of November , for further work-up and possible cardiaccatheterization.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a wellnourished , well appearing young black male.His blood pressure was 130/80 , pulse 55 , respiratory rate 12. Lungswere clear. Cardiac examination revealed S1 , S2 , with an S4present , the jugular venous pressure was 5. The patient had 2+carotid upstrokes without bruits. The abdomen was soft , good bowelsounds , with left-sided tenderness and left flank tenderness topalpation. Extremities showed no edema and good distal pulses.Neurologic examination showed cranial nerves intact , motorexamination showed some decreased power on the left , but this wasthought secondary to pain. Sensory examination was normal , and hisplantar reflexes were downgoing.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , potassium was 4.6 ,creatinine 1.3 , ALT 155 , AST 80 , LDH 228 ,creatinine kinase 79 , cholesterol 212 , triglyceride 316 , whiteblood count 6.1 , hematocrit 39 , prothrombin time 13.5 , partialthromboplastin time 89.4. Admission chest x-ray showed noabnormalities. Admission electrocardiogram revealed normal sinusrhythm at 56 beats per minute with some inverted T-waves in leadsII , III , F , and V2 through V4. The inverted T-wave in lead IIappeared to be new from a transfer electrocardiogram.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 22 of November , and was seenby the Dental Service for his atypical painradiating to the neck. His cardiac risk factors included apositive family history and a smoking history of less than 1 packper day. He had no history of diabetes or previous hypertension.The patient continued to have chest pain , which responded only tomorphine. He underwent cardiac catheterization on 30 of April , whichrevealed a right dominant circulation , kinking of the proximal leftanterior descending artery with a 70% stenosis. The patienttolerated the cardiac catheterization well without hematoma orbruit in the right groin. The patient continued to have episodesof chest pain with 5/10 left-sided sternal chest pain without clearelectrocardiogram changes from the admission electrocardiogram. Heunderwent an exercise tolerance test which showed he had 4/10 chestpain prior to beginning the exercise tolerance test , but then gotworsening chest pain during the test after 8 minutes and 15seconds , peak heart rate 160 , blood pressure 166/40. He diddevelop 1 millimeter of downsloping ST depressions in the lateralleads , and a pseudonormalization of the T-waves. The results werediscussed with the patient and the options were discussed , that ismedical management versus a repeat angioplasty or possible surgery.The patient preferred medical management and wanted to be at hometo see if increased medical management would stabilize his chestpain. The patient was discharged on 9 of SeptemberDISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. He was to haveclose FOLLOW-UP and management of his cardiac diseasewith the Cardiology Group. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE includedMotrin 600 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , diltiazem 90milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , Lopressor 50 milligrams by mouthtwice a day , Ecotrin 1 tablet by mouth per day , Pepcid 20milligrams by mouth twice a day , Isordil 40 milligrams by mouth 3times a day , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours asneeded for pain , and Halcion 0.25 milligrams by mouth at hour ofsleep.

Aldo R. Molett , M.D.2. Leigh L. Mauricio Raiford , MDPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Clotted AV fistula , atrial fibrillation ,and change in mental status.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Donalson is a 61-year-old femalewith a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy status postcardiac transplant in 1991 complicated by allograft coronaryartery disease , rejection x2 , post transplant MVR and TVR , alsowith end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , diabetes mellitus ,hypertension and a subacute change in her mental status over thelast few months that presented with a clot in her right upperextremity AV fistula. Her last hemodialysis session was two daysprior to admission , and she is usually dialyzed on Mondays ,Wednesdays and Fridays. Interventional radiology did not performa thrombectomy of the right upper extremity fistula clot , as thepatient's systolic blood pressures were in the 90s , and they wereconcerned about the patient's change in mental status as shewould need conscious sedation for the procedure. She was alsonoted upon admission to have an EKG that displayed an atrialtachyarrhythmia with 2:1 block that was presumed to be atrialflutter. Her heart rate was noted to be in the 110s to 120s , andthe rest of her vital signs were stable. The patient denied anychest pain , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , orpalpitations. It should be noted however that the patient wasnot entirely conversant. After speaking with the patient's son ,more information was obtained about this patient's subacutechange in her mental status. The patient was admitted in Julyof 2004 for a fall and femur fracture. During that admission ,the son stated that the patient had an acute change in her mentalstatus such that she did not know who she was or where she was.She was not answering questions appropriately. This waspersistent during that hospital stay and was of unclear etiology.Prior to that admission , the patient is at baseline oriented toperson , place and time , and she is also very conversant. The sondoes admit that the patient occasionally becomes confused aboutthe day of the week. Upon discharge from that admission , thepatient was sent to the Adtute Hospital for rehabilitation. Theson says that over the last few months , she has become slightlybetter but definitely not at her baseline. He states that she isoften disoriented to person and place , although she does answersome questions appropriately. The day prior to her admission ,the patient's other son visit with her at the Meretcan Hospital Of County anddid not notice any change in her mental status since herdischarge. He has noted decreased p.o. intake over the lastmonth with the patient often refusing to eat. Upon questioningthe patient , she denies chest pain , abdominal pain , shortness ofbreath , lightheadedness , and palpitations. Although , she doesanswer yes and no to some questions , she is not very conversantand does not volunteer any additional information.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy status post heart transplant in1991 complicated by allograft coronary artery disease ,post-transplant MVR and TVR , and transplant rejection x2.2. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ( Monday , Wednesday ,Friday hemodialysis ).3. Diabetes mellitus.4. Hypertension.5. Peptic ulcer disease.6. History of right frontal CVA.7. Recurrent falls of unclear etiology with a Reveal monitorimplanted.8. Asthma.HOME MEDICATIONS: Labetalol 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Imdur 30 mg p.o.q.day , lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.day , insulin NPH 20 units subcuq.a.m. , Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. q.day , Nexium 40 mg p.o.q.day , prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Imuran 50 mg p.o. q.day ,rapamycin 8 mg p.o. q.day , sevelamer 800 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lipitor20 mg p.o. q.day , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.day.ALLERGIES: Percocet.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.3 , pulse 110 , bloodpressure 90/60 , respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 96% onroom air. In general , the patient appears slightly cachetic andis in no acute distress. She is awake and is occasionallyresponding to questions but is otherwise not very conversant.She is oriented to place. Her head and neck exam isunremarkable. Her cardiovascular exam is notable for regularrate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , no gallops , 2/6 systolicmurmur at the apex. Her JVP was noted to be 8 cm. Her lungswere clear to auscultation bilaterally on a limited physical exam( the patient is not inspiring deeply on request ). Her abdomen isbenign. Her extremities are warm with 1+ DP pulses. Her rightupper extremity graft is without thrill and without bruit.LABORATORY DATA: Her laboratory values were notable for a BUN of44 , creatinine 6.8 , calcium 11.2 , PTH 263 , white blood cells 6.7 ,hematocrit 47.3 , and platelets 261.EKG: Her EKG displayed a flutter with a 2:1 block. Her heartrate was estimated to be at 110.Studies: Ms. Sluyter had a noncontrast head CT that was notablefor widened ventricles and subarachnoid spaces. She was noted tohave extensive periventricular and subcortical white matterchanges. There was a focal lesion in the frontal lobe on theright consistent with old infarct and unchanged from her CT scantwo months prior. There was no evidence for hemorrhage. Ingeneral , there was no change in the CT scan when compared to herCT scan from 5/17/04. The patient underwent a transthoracicechocardiogram on 8/20/04. This TTE showed LV with a normalsize and moderate concentric LVH. Her LVEF was noted to be 55%.There were no wall motion abnormalities. Her RV size andfunction was grossly normal. Her mitral valve was noted to bestatus post repair with a transmitral gradient of 4.0 mmHg.There was trace MR. There was no change in this echocardiogramwhen compared to her echocardiogram from 4/7/04. The patientalso underwent a lumbar puncture. Her CSF was notable for anelevated protein. Her CSF had a normal glucose , two white bloodcells with lymphocyte predominance , gram stain that did not showany organisms , and cultures that are no growth to date. Oncytology , there were no malignant cells seen in the CSF. Hercryptococcal antigen was negative. CSF studies that are pendinginclude the following: CMV culture , HSV culture , VZV culture ,Listeria culture , HSV PCR , CMV PCR , HHV6 PCR , VZV PCR , and VDRL.The cultures thus far have had no growth to date.ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. Abrams is a 61-year-old female with ahistory of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy status post cardiactransplant in 1991 complicated by allograft coronary arterydisease , post transplant MVR and TVR , and rejection , also withend-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , hypertension anddiabetes mellitus who presented with a right upper extremityfistula clot , new atrial flutter with 2:1 block and a change inher mental status that has been of many months.1. Cardiovascular:A. Pump: The patient is status post cardiac transplant and hasbeen maintained on her outpatient immunosuppressive regimen.This includes prednisone , rapamycin , and Imuran. She hasremained euvolemic during her hospital admission.B. Ischemia: There were no active issues , and the patient wasmaintained on her outpatient regimen of aspirin , statin andImdur.C. Rhythm: Electrophysiology has been seeing the patient andhas recommended medical management for her atrial flutter/atrialfibrillation with 2:1 block. The patient's heart rate rangedfrom the 80s to 120s , and she was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o.q.i.d. She seemed to respond well to the diltiazem , although itwas hard to measure a response since the patient often refusedher medications. The patient was also maintained on metoprolol75 mg p.o. q.i.d. It was hoped that the addition of thediltiazem to the metoprolol would allow for the rate control ofthis patient's atrial arrhythmia.2. Renal: The patient has a history of end-stage renal diseaseon hemodialysis. A tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed on3/9/04 for temporary access for hemodialysis. She was dialyzedwhile in the hospital and maintained on Nephrocaps. She isscheduled on 11/28/04 for a right upper extremity venogram inorder to access her anatomy for the vascular surgeons to createhemodialysis access.3. Neurology/psychiatry: The patient's change in mental statusover the last few months is still of an unclear etiology. Sheunderwent an EEG that showed diffuse slowing that was consistentwith a toxic metabolic etiology. There was no seizure activity.She underwent two CT scans of her head without contrast that werenegative for bleed. There were no changes in her CT scans whencompared to prior CT scan. She also underwent an LP with CSF asmentioned above. An MRI was not completed as the patient has anevent monitor in her heart. The differential diagnosis for thispatient is changed and her mental status still includesdepression and pseudodementia , and we are still ruling outinfectious etiologies with the CSF studies that are pending atthe moment ( although this is unlikely ). It is hoped that shewill be able to follow up with neuropsychiatric testing in orderto further evaluate her change in mental status. It should benoted that during her hospital stay , the patient's level ofinteraction with the staff varied. There were days where she wasmore conversant and would answer many questions appropriately.There were also times when the patient refused to speak withstaff , appeared withdrawn and refused medications and treatments.The son has noted that she was actually better in the hospital ,appearing more conversant and interactive. It does not appearthat these periods of increased interaction with staff and familywere in any correlation with this patient's hemodialysis.4. Endocrinology: The patient has type 2 diabetes on insulin athome. She was maintained on a sliding scale of lispro withfingersticks blood glucose before every meal and before sleeping.Her blood sugars were in control and ranged between 110 to 240.5. Infectious diseases: The patient has had a few low-gradetemperatures to the 100.0. An infectious workup did not yieldany etiology. She has not had an elevation in her white bloodcell count , although this may be a result of herimmunosuppression. Blood cultures from 7/10/04 yielded nogrowth. Urine was not cultured , as the patient is anuric.6. Feeding and electrolytes: The patient was hypercalcemic onadmission. This was attributed to vitamin D per the renalfellow. Her calcium levels were followed and trended into thenormal range. She was fed a pureed and honey thick diet afterher speech and swallow evaluation indicated that the patient hadintact swallowing function.7. GI: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease , andshe was given Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.day.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day , Imuran 50 mgp.o. q.day , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin 5000 unitssubcutaneously t.i.d. , prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.day , simvastatin 40mg p.o. q.day , Imdur sustained release 30 mg p.o. q.day ,Nephrocaps one tablet q.day , sliding scale of lispro insulin ,rapamycin 8 mg p.o. q.day , Cartia XT 240 mg p.o. q.day , andToprol XL 300 mg p.o. q.day.The patient was discharged to a Rehabilitation Center in stablecondition. She is to follow up with vascular surgery for a newaccess for hemodialysis. It is hoped that she will follow upwith neuropsychiatric testing in order to further evaluate hersubacute change in mental status. The patient has three sonsthat are very involved in her care. One of her sons is namedRoderick Nead , and his phone number is 179-486-3367.eScription document: 9-9608115 ISSten TelDictated By: CREEKMORE , EMERYAttending: GEARY , PERCYDictation ID 3553682D: 10/11/04T: 11/28/04

Since 24 of November , the patientreported recurrent congestive heart failure with chest pain and avariable bundle branch block requiring pacer placement with a DDDpacer in 1990. He had an electrophysiologic study at the time ,which was negative for ventricular tachycardia. In 1 of January , thepatient reported to Hobrook Medical Center with severe congestive heartfailure and was transferred to Mi Hospital aftertreatment for transplant evaluation. At Tiesi Hospital Medical Center on 3 of March , the patient's work-up included an exercisetolerance test with oxygen uptake of 11.1 milliliters per kilogramper minute , and a cardiac catheterization showing an essentiallyopen left internal mammary artery with saphenous vein grafts andoccluded native vessels. The right atrial pressure was 10 ,pulmonary artery pressure 54/28/30 , pulmonary capillary wedgepressure 36 , cardiac output 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440.The echocardiogram revealed severely decreased ejection of around15% with 2+ mitral regurgitation. Other issues included a positivetobacco history in the past with a moderately decreased FEV-1 of2.2 , and also hepatitis-C antibody positivity. The patient wenthome after evaluation for 2 weeks and did well without fever orchills. He did have some constipation. For 2 days , he had someincreased cough when lying down similar to his previous congestiveheart failure. The patient was readmitted on the night prior totransplantation on 9 of September , for increasing congestive heartfailure and Dobutamine treatment. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was asstated above.

Hematocrit was 38.8 , platelets 199 , 000 ,white blood cell count 8.3. The electrocardiogram revealed AVpacing at 90. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with a pacer withthe wires in the right ventricle. An echocardiogram obtained priorto transplantation revealed right atrial pressure 10 , pulmonaryartery 54/28/38 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 36 , cardiacoutput 3.6 , cardiac index 2 , PVR 44 , SVR 1440 , ejection fraction15% , 2+ mitral regurgitation.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on15 of November , and received an orthotopic hearttransplant. This was complicated by a descending aortic dissectionfrom the iliac to the left subclavian vein secondary to femoralcatheterization , because the patient had had 2 previous bypassesand would not have tolerated aortic bypass. The patient did wellpostoperatively and was placed on Cyclosporine-A and prednisone.The patient was weaned off the ventilator and Dobutamine anddiuresed without difficulty. Of note , one of the two preoperativeblood cultures grew out Clostridium perfringens. Three subsequentblood cultures were negative , however. An Infectious DiseaseService consultation was obtained , and it was felt that intravenouspenicillin for 10 to 14 days , 30 million units every 4 hours , wouldbe warranted given the patient's underlying immunosuppression. Thepatient underwent right ventricular biopsies according to theprotocol , and there was no evidence of rejection on any biopsies.The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of theaortic dissection on 11 of February , and then follow-up on 10 of March Theserevealed a type-B dissection from the left iliac to the subclavian.The ascending aorta was not involved. There was flow in both thetrue and false lumen on both tests. The renal , SMA and ciliacarteries were all intact. An echocardiogram on 11 of February , revealedgood left ventricular function , a small amount of mitralregurgitation , some increased pulmonary pressures and thedissection of the aorta. The patient underwent abdominalcomputerized tomography scan to rule out any occult source ofabscess which would be responsible for the Clostridium bacteremia ,as recommended by the gastroenterology consultant. No such sourcewas found. The patient's blood pressure was initially controlledwith Nifedipine 3 times a day 30 milligrams , until the patientreached the expected postoperative denervated tachycardia. Afterthis point , a beta blocker in the form of atenolol 25 milligrams bymouth each day was added to decrease force on the wall of thedissection. The patient was transferred to the Cardiology Servicefrom the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service on 11 of February , and did well.Adjustments were made in his Cyclosporine dose. He was initiallytried on some NPH insulin for hyperglycemia , but eventually withthe prednisone taper had good blood sugars on Glyburide 2.5milligrams by mouth each day. The goal was set for the patient'sblood pressure to be kept at all times below 140 , and this was forthe most part achieved. The patient was anemic during admission ,but postoperatively gradually his red blood cell count increased.He was started on iron sulfate to assist in his hematologicrecovery. B12 and folate levels were normal despite polys onstain. The patient's chest tube wounds were cultured during thepostoperative course and grew normal skin flora. They were packedwith wicks as necessary. The left groin lymph area drained clearfluid and persisted , but had decreased substantially prior todischarge. The patient was evaluated by the Psychiatry Service forsome features of hypomania on 17 of May They recommended Valium 5milligrams by mouth 3 times a day to counter the steroid-inducedhypomania. Physical Therapy Service was active in the patient'sambulation and felt comfortable that the patient would be able togo home and manage on his own.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. COMPLICATIONSincluded aortic dissection type B from left iliac toleft subclavian. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE were Cyclosporine-A 250milligrams by mouth twice a day , Imuran 50 milligrams by mouth eachday , prednisone 25 milligrams by mouth each day , atenolol 75milligrams by mouth each day , Glyburide 2.5 milligrams by moutheach day , Nifedipine 30 milligrams by mouth 4 times a day ,Septra-Double-Strength 1 by mouth every other day , Nystatin 15 ccby mouth 4 times a day , iron sulfate 325 milligrams by mouth 3times a day , Valium 2.5 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was to follow alow-saturated fat , low-cholesterol , no-added-salt diet. He willadvance his activity as tolerated. The patient was to have avisiting nurse daily until he feels comfortable with his own care.The visiting nurse will assist in wound dressing changes , takinghis finger sticks twice a day , taking his blood pressure andnotifying physicians for blood pressure greater than 140. Theywere to check differential blood pressures between right and leftarms. The patient will also receive physical therapy assistance tocontinue his progress in ambulation. The patient was to FOLLOW-UPwith the Cardiac Transplant Clinic on 28 of November , for routineFOLLOW-UP.CG507/0006STAN O.

HEENT:Examination showed his extraocular muscles intact , pupils equal ,round , and reactive to light , his right carotid endarterectomy hadSteri-Strips , his left carotid pulse was 2+ without bruit , he hadno lymphadenopathy , and his oropharynx was benign. LUNGS: Clearbilaterally. CARDIAC: Examination revealed a regular rate andrhythm and he was tachycardic without a murmur. ABDOMEN:Examination showed that bowel sounds were present and it wasbenign. EXTREMITIES: Examination showed no clubbing , cyanosis , oredema , posterior tibial pulses were 2+/2+ , and his dorsalis pedispulses were trace bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination showedthat he was alert and oriented times three and grossly non-focal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Significant for a normal SMA 7 , CBC whichhad a white count of 3.7 , a hematocrit of33.8 with 407 platelets , a sedimentation rate was 48 , his digoxinlevel on transfer was 1.3 , his procainamide level was 2.6 , and hisNAPA was 1.1 on transfer. An EKG showed atrial flutter at 140.HOSPITAL COURSE: He underwent cardiac catheterization on July , 1996 which revealed a left dominant systemwith left anterior descending with serial 60% complex lesions , midleft anterior descending 70% lesion , and a ramus 40% lesion. Theleft circumflex was totally occluded proximally and the rightcoronary artery was small with an 80% mid vessel stenosis. Leftventriculogram revealed normal systolic function. On November ,1996 , he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery with aLIMA to his left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to hisOM1 , and a saphenous vein graft to his OM2. On May , 1996 ,he developed atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 180 range ,blood pressure 160/90 , he complained of palpitations , and wasdiaphoretic. He received Lopressor 5 mg intravenously times two ,his blood pressure responded with decrease to 120/72 , and his heartrate remained in the 140 range with atrial fibrillation. Heconverted to normal sinus rhythm in the eighties. He was loadedwith Digoxin and maintained on Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. Thatevening , he had a second episode of atrial fibrillation. OnMarch , 1996 , he underwent right carotid endarterectomy for anasymptomatic 90% stenosis. In the PACU , he had atrial fibrillationin the 150 range with decreased blood pressure to the seventies.On March , 1996 , he had another episode of atrial fibrillationlasting approximately thirty minutes which converted to normalsinus rhythm with 5 mg of Lopressor. On January , 1996 , heconverted into atrial fibrillation at approximately 4 a.m. and hisblood pressure was 160/100 , his heart rate was approximately in the130 range , and carotid sinus pressure produced no change in hisrate. An ECG revealed a supraventricular tachycardia at 130 beatsper minute , likely atrial flutter , with 2:1 conduction.

The LIMA was used to bypass the LAD ,the left radial artery was used to bypass the ramus , andsaphenous vein was used to bypass the OM1 , PDA and LVB1. Thecardiopulmonary bypass time was 145 minutes and the aorticcross-clamp time was 116 minutes. The patient tolerated theprocedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac SurgeryIntensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. Onpostoperative day #1 , the patient was extubated. He complained ofright hand weakness and numbness but was otherwise recoveringvery well. The Neurology Service was consulted and they suggestedthat the right hand symptoms were from surgical manipulation ofthe chest or positioning of the arm intraoperatively.Occupational therapy and physical therapy were consulted to treatthe patient's right hand weakness and numbness. Otherwise , thepatient was progressing very well. He was started on Lopressorto prevent atrial fibrillation and diltiazem for his radialartery bypass graft. He was off all hemodynamic drips and was ina stable rhythm with a stable blood pressure. The patient's dietwas advanced as tolerated and he was producing good urine output.The patient was followed very closely throughout thepostoperative period by the Diabetes Management Service for highglucose levels. On postoperative day #2 , the patient's pacerwires and chest tubes were removed without complication. He wasambulating and showed good postoperative progress. Onpostoperative days 3 and 4 , the patient continued diuresis forpostoperative fluid retention. The patient's white blood cellcount was noted to be 13.7 and a urinalysis and urine culturewere sent. The urine culture grew greater than 100 , 000 colonyforming units of gram-negative rods and he was started onciprofloxacin for five-day course for postoperative urinary tractinfection. Otherwise , by postoperative #5 the patient hadprogressed extremely well. He was ambulating in the halls. Hehad moved his bowels and had no difficulties with urination.He had no complaints of pain. He had remained in a sinus rhythmwith a stable blood pressure and was oxygenating well on roomair. The patient was ready for discharge home. The DiabetesManagement Service met with the patient to discuss taking insulinat home for his poor glucose control. He agreed to take Lantusat night and follow up with his primary care physician for futuremanagement of his diabetes mellitus. On the morning of dischargehome , the patient's vital signs were temperature 97.7 degrees ,heart rate 86 in the sinus rhythm , blood pressure 110/70 ,respiratory rate 20 and O2 saturation 95% on room air. Thepatient was still 5 kg above his preoperative weight and shouldcontinue Lasix for five more days , once he is discharged home.LABORATORY DATA: Labs on the day of discharge home.

She had a catheterization at that time which revealeddiffuse three vessel disease , none of which was significant. In1998 , she developed a left bundle branch on her EKG but it was notclear when exactly this happened. She stated that for the pastyear , she got these stabbing pains in the center of her chest thatthen progressed to a squeezing pain with palpitations. Sometimes ,there was relation to exertion but no relation to meals or positionand this chest pain had been increasing in frequency over the pasttwo to three weeks so now it occurred approximately two to threetimes a week and was associated with shortness of breath. Two daysprior to admission , she developed constant chest pain that went toher left arm and made four of her left fingers numb. She was quiteshort of breath though she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,orthopnea , lower extremity edema , increased nocturia , and diet ormedication noncompliance.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant also for diabetes for which shetook insulin and checked her sugars at homewhich ran 170 range to 200 range , hypertension , and she hadidiopathic drop attacks. She got these episodes where her legsfell out from under her without warning but she did not loseconsciousness. She had had an MRI/MRA that showed some diffusesmall vessel disease but the MRA was normal.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , simvastatin 10q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , and NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m.ALLERGIES: Penicillin caused a rash and intravenous contrast dyecaused hives.SOCIAL HISTORY: She was a retired nurses' aide who retired in1992 , she was a widow , and she had two livingchildren who were grown. She lived alone and took care of hereight year old great-grandson but had a daughter and son-in-law wholived next door.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , significant for an elderlyobese African-American woman lying in bed insome mild respiratory distress. Her oropharynx was moist , herjugular venous pressure was 12 cm , her lungs had scattered cracklesat the bases , her heart was regular with an S4 , her belly was softand nontender , her extremities had trace edema , and her rectalexamination showed guaiac negative brown stool.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed a left bundle branch blockand chest x-ray showed mild pulmonaryedema and Kerley B lines. Her laboratories on admission were allwithin normal limits. Her initial CK was 97 with troponin of 0.01.ASSESSMENT: In summary , this is a 72 year old woman with multiplecardiac risk factors who presented with chest pain ofunclear etiology. She was admitted for evaluation.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - She was admitted forcatheterization which showed three vesseldisease , again nonsignificant and not changed from thecatheterization in 1997. She ruled out for a myocardialinfarction. She had an echo which showed some element of diastolicdysfunction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 36 plus RAbut no wall motion abnormalities. It was felt that she had someelement of diastolic dysfunction that caused her to go into a bitof pulmonary edema , maybe subendocardial ischemia. Therefore ,while she was maintained on her aspirin and simvastatin , her bloodpressure regimen was advanced. Her heart rate was in the fiftiesto sixties and Atenolol 50 b.i.d. was added. She was on a maximumof Lisinopril at 40 milligrams so nifedipine extended release wasadded and titrated up to 120 milligrams q.d. where she maintainedsystolic blood pressures in the 160 range nevertheless. This couldbe further titrated as an outpatient.2. For her congestive heart failure , she diuresed approximatelyfour liters through admission with Lasix at 40 intravenously andwould be discharged on a seven day course of Lasix at 20 p.o. q.d.for further diuresis.3. Pulmonary - She did have hypoxia on admission to 85% on roomair while lying in bed. This was felt to be out of proportion toher mild congestive heart failure and further causes were sought.Her D-dymer was greater than 1000 and she then went for a V/Q scanwhich was low probability. Her lower extremity noninvasives werenegative. She also had a chest CT which showed no interstitiallung disease. She had pulmonary function tests which wereconsistent with restrictive picture and were not much changed fromher pulmonary function tests in 1998. A pulmonary consultation wasobtained who believed that the congestive heart failure along withobesity underlying restrictive lung disease could be the cause ofher hypoxia and , in fact , after further diuresis , her shortness ofbreath much improved and she had O2 saturations that were 93% onroom air.4. Endocrine - She was maintained on metformin during admissionand also on half of her dose of her normal dose of NPH given herdecreased p.o. intake , however , given the fact that she stated thather sugars at home on her regimen of 43 q.a.m. and 24 q.p.m. were170 to 200 , she was discharged on this regimen with instructions tocheck her sugar and call her doctor if they were low.DISPOSITION: She is discharged in stable condition on January ,2000. She will follow up with Dr. Nakajima , her primarycare doctor , and in addition , with Dr. Klang , her cardiologist.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25q.d. , Lisinopril 40 q.d. , nifedipineextended release 120 q.d. , metformin 500 q.d. , NPH 43 q.a.m. and 24q.p.m. , simvastatin 10 q.d. , aspirin 325 q.d. , and Lasix 20milligrams p.o. q.d. times seven days.Dictated By: VICTOR LIETZOW , M.D. JN10Attending: CORY R.

He was well until l96l whenhe initially presented with left bundle-branch block , leftventricular hypertrophy , and transient chest pain. He then hadhigh grade ventricular ectopic activity in l972 treated withQuinaglute. Subsequently from l972 to l988 , examination wasnotable for worsening left ventricular function. In l988 , he hadrecurrent frequent congestive heart failure and underwent cardiaccatheterization which showed an enlarged hypokinetic ventricle withan ejection fraction of around 32%. His coronary arteries showedacute marginal of 70% stenosis and 40% of the mid circumflex. In1/5 , his ejection fraction by right ventriculogram was 20%. In2/8 , he had atypical pneumonia followed by recurrent congestiveheart failure. Subsequent course was notable for dyspnea onexertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea. He wastreated with Lasix , Zaroxolyn , Captopril , and Quinaglute. InMarch , he was admitted to the Worthrest Hospital forworsening symptoms , weight gain , and creatinine of 2.9. He wasmanaged with decreased Lasix , increased Captopril , and ultimatelydecided to treate with Lasix and Zaroxolyn. He was then placed onthe Cardiac Transplant List and underwent transplant evaluation.Exercise tolerance test showed 8 minutes and 43 seconds bicyclewith O2 uptake of l2. Right heart catheterization showed wedgepressure of 25. PPD was negative and abdominal ultrasound wasnegative. Echo showed global left ventricular dysfunction , apicalthrombus , mild tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitralregurgitation. Cholesterol was l53 , l-2 immunoglobulins withinnormal limits , and toxo was plus IgG and minus IgM. He hadnegative hepatitis , histo , blasto , or coccidiomycosis. CMV showedborderline IgG and negative IgM and EBV showed positive IgG andnegative IgM. Since his discharge in August , he has notedworsening of symptoms with decreased exercise tolerance andincreased orthopnea.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ended up beingstarted on Dobutamine and had gradually decliningcourse during his admission culminating in having a cardiactransplant when a heart became available. This occurred on10/9/9l. His post-operative course was uncomplicated and hissubsequent course was complicated only by acute worsening of hisrenal function associated with high Cyclosporin levels with theCyclosporin held and the level allowed to come down. His renalfunction returned to baseline. He also developed an oral herpeslesion. He subsequently did very well post-operatively. Multipleright ventricular biopsies were negative for rejection. On biopsyon 11/21 , his wedge pressure was l8 , right atrial pressure l3 ,right ventricular 48/l4 , and PA pressure of 48/24. He toleratedslow taper of his steroids without event and it was noted that hehad some tremor also post-operatively which was attributed toCyclosporin toxicity. Other than that , his post-operative coursewas uncomplicated.DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home on 1/13/9l.

CHEST PAIN , FOR RULE OUT MYOCARDIALINFARCTIONSECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES3. CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION4. HYPERTENSIONHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old , Spanishspeaking woman with multiple cardiacrisk factors who presented complaining of unstable chest pain. Thepatient's cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , a positive family history ,previous history of smoking as well as postmenopausal statesecondary to hysterectomy 21 years ago and not on estrogenreplacement therapy. The patient has a two to three year historyof exertional angina. Of note , approximately one year ago shebegan to have substernal chest pain at rest. The patient statesthat currently she is having approximately three episodes a day onaverage. She describes these as substernal chest pressure whichradiates to her bilateral arms as well as her jaw. She denies anyassociated shortness of breath but does occasionally notediaphoresis. She denies any nausea or vomiting or palpitations.In September of 1994 the patient underwent an echocardiogram whichshowed a left atrial size of 4.0 cm and ejection fraction ofapproximately 60% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mildtricuspid regurgitation. Since this time she has been followed byDr. Maximo Bryum in C&O MEDICAL CENTER Clinic who initiated an antianginal regimenwhich resulted in decreased frequency of her symptoms. Of note thepatient recently stopped taking Aspirin. Her symptoms thenrecurred. On the 5 of February , 1995 the patient underwent aDobutamine MIBBE on which she went 6 minutes and 48 secondsreaching a maximal heart rate of 154 , a blood pressure of 172/82.The test showed 2 mm ST depressions diffusely. The MIBBE showedmoderate to severe reversible anterior and anteroseptal wallischemia. Of note , on the morning of admission the patient wasseen by her VNA. During her VNA's visit the patient began to haveher typical anginal symptoms with radiation to her arms and jaw aswell as shortness of breath. She denied any diaphoresis or nausea.The patient was given three sublingual Nitroglycerins after herprimary M.D. was called and her pain resolved after approximately15 minutes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for a 10 yearhistory of Insulin dependent diabetes with complications includingneuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic atrial fibrillation included anormal TSH. Hypertension. Degenerative joint disease.Gastroesophageal reflux. Status post hysterectomy approximately 21years ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.which the patient recently stopped , Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopipd 600mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Insulin , NPH , 75 units sub-qq.a.m. , 50 units q.p.m. , Insulin Regular 25 units sub-q q.a.m.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her heart rate was 58 , blood pressure141/73 , O-2 saturation 97% on 2 liters ,respiratory rate 16 and unlabored. HEENT exam showed pupils equalround and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact.Oropharynx was clear. Mucous membranes were moist. Neck wassupple with full range of motion. Jugular venous pressure wasdifficult to assess secondary to increased soft tissue around theneck. Carotids were 2+ and without bruits. Cardiac exam showed anirregularly irregular rate and rhythm , a normal S-1 and S-2 , a I/VIsystolic ejection murmur noted at the left upper sternal border.Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. Abdomen was soft ,nontender , obese with active bowel sounds. Extremities showed aright shin scar which was healing well. There was no clubbing orcyanosis , no evidence of any femoral bruits. Rectal examinationwas guaiac negative. On neurologic examination the patient wasalert and oriented x 2. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.Strength was 5/5 bilaterally. There was decreased sensation tolight touch bilaterally in the lower extremities.LABORATORY DATA: On admission Sodium 134 , Potassium 4.7 , Chloride96 , Bicarb 22 , BUN 28 , Creatinine 1.3 , BloodGlucose 472 , Digoxin level 1.0. PT 14.5 , PTT 26. Urinalysis wasnegative. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 60 with anormal axis. T wave inversions were noted in both leads 3 and Fand Q waves were noted in V-1 through V-3. Chest x-ray showed noevidence of infiltrates or effusions. There was borderlinecardiomegaly.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to Medicine Team Voone Parkway , Ainggo Ra I , Alaska 89772She was ruled out for myocardial infarction withserial CK , MB and EKG's. Heparin was initially started given thepossibility that this was unstable angina. The Cardiology Team wasconsulted for recommendations on possible cardiac catheterization.On further review of her history the Cardiology Team decided toschedule a cardiac catheterization. This was performed on the 7 of October and showed mildly elevated right sided pressure including aright atrial pressure of 15 , an RV pressure of 50/16 with a mean PApressure of 32 , pulmonary capillary wedge of 22. The coronaryarteries were noted to be normal and left ventricular function wasalso assessed as normal. The patient tolerated this procedure welland without complications. Given the confluence of her data , twopossible explanations were postulated including either syndrome Xor small vessel disease , not noted on cardiac catheterization. Thepatient remained stable , status post cardiac catheterization andwas prepared for discharge. Also during her hospital course thepatient's Insulin dosages were adjusted in the manner to keep herblood sugars in the approximately 200 range.DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Enteric Coated Aspirin 325mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Lopid 600 mgp.o. q.d.; Insulin NPH 100 units sub-q q.a.m. , 70 units sub-qq.h.s. , Insulin Regular 25 units sub-q q.a.m.; Lisinopril 10 mgp.o. q.d.; Nitroglycerin 1/150th one tablet sublingual q. 5 minutesx 3 p.r.n. chest pain; Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Coumadin 10 mgp.o. q.h.s.; Diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. q.d.

She has two children and lives alone since hospitalization.FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 99.2 , pulse 89 ,blood pressure 130/86 , respiratory rate 20 , and oxygen saturation100% on room air. General , the patient is in no acute distress ,but is unable to talk with the trach tube currently in place.HEENT , mucous membranes are moist and there are no OP lesions.Neck , JVP is not appreciated due to the patient's body habitus.Cardiovascular , heart rate is regular , regular rhythm , nomurmurs , gallops , or rubs. Chest , decreased breath sounds in allfields with a prolonged expiratory phase. Abdomen , bowel soundsare present , abdomen is obese , nontender , and there is a G tubein place. Extremities , no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.Extremities are obese. Skin , no rashes or bruises. Neurologic ,no cranial nerve , sensory , or motor deficits noted. Gait isdeferred.LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION: The patient's CBC reveals ahematocrit of 29.2 , which is consistent with her baseline of 28to 30. Her CBC , chem-7 , and LFTs are all unremarkable.PROCEDURES:1. Trach tube change - the patient's tracheostomy tube waschanged to a Custom #6 Bivona on 10/21/05 by Dr. Klatt ( Surgery ).2. Bronchoscopy - A bronchoscopy was performed on 5/28/05 andrevealed erythematous soft tissue in the posterior pharynx ,compromising the airway above the trach tube. Granulation tissuewas noted above the site of the trach tube that also appeared topotentially compromise the airway.3. Modified barium swallow - modified barium swallow wasperformed on 10/21/05 , which revealed a moderate aspiration risk.The patient was recommended for a mechanical soft diet.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Trach change: On admission , the patient was admitted to theGeneral Medical Service for problems with her trach tube. Overthe course of this admission , her trach tube did become dislodgedon numerous occasions. During these times , either surgery orrespiratory therapy were required to reinsert the trach tube.However , the patient remained stable throughout these events witha pulse oximetry reading greater than 92% , even when thetube became dislodged. The patient required a Custom fit #6Bivona cuffless trach tube. Dr. Avellano ( General Surgery ) inserted this tubewithout incident. Initially , the patient did feel some irritation once thetube was inserted , however , this resolved with deep suctioning and nebulizertherapy. Once inserted , the new trach tube fit well and thepatient was comfortable , with oxygen saturations greater than 92%on trach mask oxygen.2. Redundant oropharyngeal tissue: During this admission , thepatient underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate for possibiledecannulation. However , this procedure revealedexcessive tissue in her upper oropharynx andwhat appeared to be edematous tissue in the airway. The significance of thisfinding was uncertain , although it was felt that this tissue couldcompromise the airway if her trach tube was removed. Therefore ,the patient should not be decannulated without repeat evaluation of herupper airway. Throughout this hospitalcourse , the patient had her trach tube in place. She was able touse a Passey-Muir valve for speaking and she may continue to useone with her trach tube in place.3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history ofrecurrent pneumonia and poor pulmonary function , the patientunderwent a modified barium swallow evaluation for possibleaspiration pneumonia. She was found to have some difficultyduring this evaluation , and Speech and Swallow recommended thepatient continue a mechanical soft diet without fluidrestrictions indefinitely. During this hospital course , thepatient had been on tube feeds through her G tube , although thesemay be tapered once the patient is tolerating oral food well.COMPLICATIONS: None.CONSULTANTS: Dr. August Adkinson , General Surgery.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: On discharge , the patient'stemperature was 97.8 , pulse 81 , blood pressure 122/84 ,respiratory rate 22 , and oxygen saturation 100% on supplementaloxygen of 30% by trach mask.

439208147 | AMC | 68446510 | | 633422 | 2/9/1996 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 5/28/1996 Report Status: SignedDischarge Date: 10/12/1996DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ATYPICAL ANGINA AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 76 year old male withincreased anginal symptoms forapproximately one month post-PTCA. This patient had knownmultivessel coronary artery disease status post angioplastyadmitted with six hours of rest chest pain with non-diagnostic EKGchanges and initial troponin and CK negative. Patient's riskfactors include a history of hypertension , prior history oftobacco , non-insulin dependent diabetes , his age , and sex. InApril 1995 , the patient developed his first symptoms of cardiacangina. He was admitted on 7/10/95 with chest pain at rest andminimal EKG changes. CK initially was 210 and MB was not done.Patient did not rule in. On 10/23/95 , the patient underwentcardiac catheterization with elevated right atrial pressure of 39and 14 , mildly elevated , and three vessel disease with 70% proximalstenosis of his left anterior descending artery , 90% apicalstenosis with 30% stenosis of the left circumflex , and two serial95% stenoses distally of the left circumflex noted. His firstdiffuse marginal branch had 30% to 40% diffuse luminal irregularityin his right coronary artery. Posterior descending artery wasnoted to have a 90% mid stenosis. Systolic function was normalwith ejection fraction of 71%. On 10/23/95 , the patient had aballoon angioplasty of the proximal and 95% stenosis of his leftcircumflex artery. On 11/1/95 , the patient continued to complainof chest pressure. He underwent exercise tolerance test. He wentfive minutes and one second stopping secondary to leg fatigue witha 2 mm ST segment depression. He underwent cardiac catheterizationwith angioplasty of his mid posterior descending artery with 30%residual stenosis and a small dissection of the inferior margin ofthe vessel. He was discharged home aspirin , Lisinopril , Atenolol ,Micronase , and enoxaparin. Patient was well at home until the dayof his admission when he had retrosternal chest pressure of 10/10at approximately 6 p.m. He took three sublinguals without reliefand presented to the Emergency Room with 5/10 chest pressure. Inthe Emergency Room , he had some relief of his chest pressure withsublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous nitroglycerin broughtsignificant relief. He had non-diagnostic EKG changes but wasadmitted to the CCU for concern for unstable anginal pattern.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for C4-C5 radiculopathy withsteroid injection for pain control , inguinalhernia , and benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethralresection of the prostate.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 q.d. , Lisinopril7.5 q.d. , Atenolol 75 q.d. , Micronase 5 q.d. ,and enoxaparin 60 mg q.12h.ALLERGIES: Patient was allergic to penicillin with a rash.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , patient was in no acutedistress with a heart rate of 54 , bloodpressure 114/78 , respiratory rate 18 , and saturation 97% on fourliters. On 100 micrograms of nitroglycerin and Heparin , there wasno chest discomfort. HEENT: Benign. LUNGS: Few basilarcrackles. CARDIOVASCULAR: Examination showed bradycardia withII/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and apex.ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a potassiumof 3.9 , hematocrit of 37.1 , troponin of 0 ,and CK initially of 121. EKG revealed a sinus bradycardia withnormal intervals , normal axis , and no new change as compared to oldEKG.HOSPITAL COURSE: Assessment was that this was basically a 76 yearold with known coronary artery disease presentingwith unstable angina with no significant troponin or CK values.Given his history of recent intervention and coronary arterydisease , this appeared consistent with unstable angina. Thepatient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with his CK flatand repeat troponin of 0. He was continued on intravenous Heparinand nitroglycerin in the interval amount of time until he ruled outand his aspirin therapy was decreased down to 81 with simvastatinstarted. Patient received repeat catheterization on 1/9/96 whichrevealed 50% stenosis at the mid left circumflex at the PTA site ,30% to 40% stenosis of the distal posterior descending artery atthe PTA site , 40% proximal left anterior descending , 95% distalleft anterior descending at the apex , and 70% distal leftcircumflex giving rise to two PLV branches. The plan was that thepatient would get a distal left circumflex PTCA tomorrow when therewould be surgical back-up available. The patient was continued onintravenous Heparin and nitroglycerin overnight without anyrecurrent chest discomfort. On 10/16/96 , the patient had PTCAtimes three at the mid left circumflex 50% to 60% stenosisballooned to 30% , distal left circumflex 80% stenosis was balloonedto 30% residual , and distal left anterior descending with 90%stenosis ballooned to 20% residual. Post-PTCA , the patient wascontinued on Heparin overnight without any recurrent chestdiscomfort. There was a issue with this patient of whether hischest discomfort given its atypical nature was cardiac in etiologyalthough he definitely had disease on angiography but he hadsignificant possibility for other etiologies as a source for hisdiscomfort such as cervical radiculopathy with left arm numbnessand occasional anterior chest discomfort which he had difficultydistinguishing from any anginal-like discomfort. He also had ahistory of gastrointestinal distress with frequent gaseousness.The patient was basically observed 24 hours after his Heparin wasstopped , he was restarted on enoxaparin , and continued on aspirin ,Captopril , Lopressor , and simvastatin. Patient did not have anyrecurrent chest discomfort in the interim observation and he wasdischarged home on a stable out-patient regimen. Additionalin-house issues included that gastrointestinally , patient wascontinued on Prilosec and Maalox therapy for his gaseousness andgastrointestinal distress. Given the crackles on examination , hehad a chest x-ray which was negative for any infiltrate and herequired some O2 supplementation initially when he presented but hewas weaned off O2 prior to discharge. As far as his diabetes , hecontinued on his out-patient Micronase with b.i.d. fingerstickmonitoring which was normal. Fluids , electrolyte , and nutritionwise , his potassium and magnesium were kept optimally repletedgiven his cardiac history.DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged in stable condition.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,Atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Micronase 5 mg q.d. ,Lisinopril 2.5 mg q.d. , and sublingual nitroglycerin.FOLLOW-UP: Patient is to schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr.Rater for cardiac follow-up. The plan was thathe would call Dr. Hedges for follow-up.Dictated By: SAMUAL C. DUCH , M.D. SL26Attending: ORLANDO J. SOSBY , M.D. JZ2CZ901/3039Batch: 31556 Index No. EKHJI08N3H D: 10/25/96T: 7/6/96

His heart rate was62 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 170/72. Hisoxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. He was awake and alertand in no acute distress. His jugular venous pressure wasapproximately 12 cm of water. His heart had a regular rate andrhythm with normal S1 and S2 and a systolic murmur at the leftupper sternal border. He did not have any signs of pulsesparadoxes. His lungs had decreased breath sounds at the rightbase with rales at the left base. His abdomen was soft anddistended but nontender. There were normoactive bowel sounds.The extremities had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally at the shins.His neurologic exam was nonfocal.LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:His sodium was 134 and his potassium was 3.4. His chloride was100 and his bicarb was 21. His BUN was 140 and his creatininewas 7.0. His white blood cell count was 8.4 and his hematocritwas 26.1. His INR was 2.5. His calcium was 9.0. His EKG showednormal sinus rhythm at the rate of 61 beats per minute. This wasa paced rhythm. His chest x-ray showed volume overload andcardiomegaly.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Renal: On admission , Mr. Muraski had significant volumeoverload with weight gain , edema , and chest x-ray evidence ofpulmonary edema. He also had significant azotemia with a BUN of140. His creatinine had also increased from his baselinecreatinine of 5.0 to 7.0 at admission. His physical examinationthe morning after admission showed worsening somnolence and slowasterixis with jerky myoclonic movements. On 8/26/05 , thetunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed in his right internaljugular vein by interventional radiology. This procedure wastolerated without complication. Mr. Stahlnecker had his first run ofhemodialysis on 9/27/05 , which he tolerated well with subsequentimprovement in his mental status and resolution of his asterixis.He again underwent hemodialysis on 5/30/05 , 9/15/05 and9/14/05. In addition , he underwent a two-hour run ofultrafiltration on 5/24/05 with removal of nearly four liters offluid. Mr. Lavergne will continue with intermittent hemodialysison a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday schedule after discharge fromBelllit Community Hospital . Plans are underway for Mr. Schroeppelto have an AV fistula placed. He has a follow-up appointment on4/3/05 with vascular surgery at F.shands Ieldmormode Hospital .2. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: Mr. Grassman was maintainedon a renal diet. He was started on Nephrocaps multivitamin. On9/27/05 , he was started on Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. for a phosphoruslevel of 5.8. However , on 5/24/05 , his phosphorus level was 1.8and therefore his Phoslo was held.3. Cardiovascular: Mr. Wallau has a long history ofhypertension and he is treated with multiple medications. Hissystolic blood pressures have ranged in the 160-180s during thisadmission. He was continued on his Norvasc and labetolol. Hewas also continued on hydralazine at 100 mg t.i.d. In addition ,lisinopril was added and titrated to 10 mg p.o. daily. Inaddition , he was continued on his clonidine at 0.6 mg b.i.d. Mr.Bacus blood pressure did not return to a normal level after hewas dialyzed repeatedly. His blood pressure will need to becontinued to be monitored at rehab with potentially additionalmedicines added. In addition , Mr. Mok has a history ofcoronary artery disease with recent non-ST elevation MI. He wasinitially due to be discharged on 9/15/05 , but shortly afterhemodialysis , he had one 15-minute episode of sharp left-sidedchest pain. He was therefore ruled out for myocardial infarctionwith serial enzymes and EKGs. He showed no evidence ofmyocardial infarction.4. Hematology: Mr. Buetti is maintained on Coumadin for historyof deep venous thrombosis. When he was first admitted , hisCoumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneledhemodialysis catheter. He received one oral dose of vitamin K aswell as fresh frozen plasma prior to placement of the line. Hewas subsequently restarted on his Coumadin and it was titratedwhile being treated with antibiotics. His previous dose was 4 mgand he will be discharged on that dose.5. Endocrine: Mr. Woodburn has a history of diabetes mellitus andwas maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.6. Infectious Disease: Mr. Goodyear became febrile to 101 degreesFahrenheit on 1/13/05. He was again febrile on 9/14/05. Hisurine culture grew out enterobacter cloacae , which wassubsequently found to be pan resistant. Prior to hissensitivities being obtained , he was treated with levofloxacin.When it was determined that the enterobacter was resistant tolevofloxacin , he was switched to gentamicin 60 mg IV x1 on1/18/05. He should receive several additional days ofgentamicin approximately five or six days. He should be dosedafter hemodialysis for a gentamicin level less than 5. Mr.Montogomery did have one positive blood culture from 7/18/05 thatgrew out gram-positive cocci in clusters at the time of thisdictation. There was only one out of four bottles that grew outthese gram-positive cocci. He did receive one dose of vancomycinin the early morning of 1/18/05. It was felt that this bloodculture most likely represented a contaminant. All of his otherblood cultures remained negative at the time of this dictation.DISPOSITION:Mr. Mckean will be discharged to the Westjo Hospital Hisblood pressure and INR will need to be monitored. He willcontinue on hemodialysis three times per week. He has anappointment at vascular surgery on 4/3/05 to plan for AVfistula formation.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:He was afebrile.

The patient was doing yardwork in the afternoon when he experienced an episode of nausea andvomiting along with chest discomfort. The patient presented to hisprimary care physician who noted EKG changes with ST depressions inV3 to V6 and was sent to the emergency room which was noted to havean old T wave inversion in lead 3 which was now upright and STdepressions that were normalizing. CKs at that time were 974 , MB24.3 , Troponin level was 1.77. The patient received aspirin 5 mgof intravenous Lopressor , Heparin drip and Adenosine MIBI which wasperformed back in April of 1999 revealed inferior ischemia. Thepatient underwent cardiac catheterization on June , 2001 whichrevealed the following: Right dominant system , no significant leftmain lesions identified , left anterior descending coronary arterywith a discreet mid 65% lesion , distal 99% lesion and firstdiagonal coronary artery with a proximal discrete 70% lesion , leftcircumflex coronary artery with a distal after the second obtusemarginal discrete 60% lesion , supplying the second obtuse marginal.First marginal coronary artery had an ostial discrete 90% lesionand a second obtuse marginal had an ostial discrete 100% lesion.Right coronary artery had a mid discrete 95% lesion supplying theright posterior descending coronary artery. He was also noted tohave collateral flow from left anterior descending artery to theright posterior descending artery. The patient underwentechocardiogram on June , 2001 which revealed the following: 1.There was mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normalcavity size. Left ventricular systolic function is mildly reducedwith an estimated ejection fraction of 45%. There is severehypokinesis of the basal and mid segments of the inferior wall andinferior septum. In addition , there is severe hypokinesis of theposterior wall , apex and distal anterior wall. THis is suggestiveof multiple coronary artery disease. 2. The right ventricleappears normal in size and systolic function. 3. The mitral valveappears mildly thickened. The anterior mitral leaflet is mildlyelongated and there might be mild systolic prolapse of the anteriorleaflet. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. 4. The aortic valveis trileaflet and appears mildly thickened. There is no aorticstenosis or regurgitation. 5. The tricuspid valve appearsstructurally normal.

He is three and onehalf months after a presentation with subacute left circumflexthrombosis , ischemic mitral regurgitation , pulmonary edema and asmall nontransmural myocardial infarction. His angiography at thattime revealed diffuse coronary atherosclerosis with attenuation anddiffuse narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary arteryand a small codominant right coronary system with extensive diffusedisease. Large circumflex system with focally severe andadditional diffuse but noncritical stenosis with superimposedthrombus. Dilatation of the left circumflex resulted in extensivedissection but with eventual achievement of a very goodangiographic and clinical result after placement of multiple stentsand that his course was that of gradual recovery and uneventfulreturn home.He remained frail and limited prior to this admission andapproximately six weeks prior to admission , began to haveoccasional pain and shortness of breath. He went to the cardiaccatheterization laboratory for intervention. He underwent arotablator procedure on 8/20/02 in the cath. laboratory whichresulted in perforation of circumflex coronary artery into thepericardial space with extravasation of blood. He went intocardiogenic shock which was alleviated by intra-aortic balloon pumpplacement and was seen in consultation by the cardiac surgeryservice for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. He went tothe operating room on 8/20/02 where he underwent emergent coronaryartery revascularization. He sustained a retained rotablator burrin the left circumflex system and a left circumflex perforation.He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 5 with left internalmammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery ,saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery , saphenousvein graft to the obtuse marginal #2 , #3 and #1 and removal of arotablator burr , repair of the left ventricular apex vent. site.He came off bypass on 2 mcg of epinephrine and his intra-aorticballoon pump. During his code in the cath. lab , the patient hadbecome hypotensive requiring intubation and intra-aortic balloonpump placement as noted above. A Foley catheter was placed by theurology service attending with much difficulty. His chest was leftopen at the time of operation as the patient was coagulopathic andEsmarch closure was placed.His postoperative course: His coagulopathy was reversed with bloodproducts and his chest was closed without event on August , 02. Hewas also seen in consultation by the diabetic management service tohelp with his diabetic management. He continued to havepostoperative cardiac failure , remained on Dopamine , intra-aorticballoon pump , was slowly weaned and diuresis ensued. Hisintra-aortic balloon pump was removed on postoperative day threeuneventfully. He continued to make good improvement and wasextubated on postoperative day four and transferred to thestep-down unit. He had mild confusion but has had a history ofcerebrovascular accident in the past. He still requires diuresis.Chest tubes remained in place for very high chest tube output. Hewas seen in consultation by the vascular surgery service for hissevere peripheral vascular disease and painful right foot. He wasalso continued to be followed by urologic service and his Foley wasleft in place. He did have a bump in his BUN and creatinine andrenal consult was obtained and helps with management of his fluidbalance. He was also seen in consultation by the thoracic surgeryservice for increased chest tube output , mainly from the rightpleural chest tube. His other chest tubes were discontinuedwithout any complications and his acute renal failure began toresolve. He received Albumin and packed cells to correcthypoalbuminemia and also his postoperative anemia along with Lasixfor diuresis. He continued to make slow improvement and advancednutritionally. He had a vascular MRI which was done as requestedby vascular surgery service in preparation for potentialrevascularization to his right leg. He continued to improve. HisBUN and creatinine were 90/3.5 at their highest level and have beenslowly declining over the past several weeks to today's level of 47for BUN and 1.3 for creatinine. He continues to have low bloodcell counts; his white blood cell count is 3 today and hishematocrit is 32.8. Platelet count is 98. He will requirefollow-up for these on a two times weekly basis. His MRI showsmild irregularity of the distal abdominal aorta as well as the leftcommon iliac artery , mild narrowing over long segment about threecm. over the right external iliac artery. There is moderate focalnarrowing in the right common femoral artery at the bifurcationbetween the superficial femoral and deep femoral and there iscomplete occlusion in the distal right superficial femoral arterywith reconstitution three cm further. Multiple areas of focalnarrowing are seen in the proximal and distal left superficialfemoral artery , high grade stenosis in the proximal left poplitealartery. The posterior tibial artery on the right side iscompletely occluded proximally. On the left side , there is highgrade stenosis in the anterior tibial proximally as well asocclusion of the anterior tibial in the mid calf withreconstitution distally and complete occlusion of the posteriortibial artery at it's origin. Peroneal shows moderate posteriorstenosis. He has moderate to severe atherosclerotic disease in thelower extremities with multiple areas of narrowing inclusion.

Her EKG onadmission showed she was ventricularly paced at 54 beats perminute and that her EKG was unchanged from her prior EKG fromSeptember , 2005.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:1. Cardiovascular pump: Initially , the patient's Imdur andlabetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poorrenal perfusion. However , on the hospital day #1 without IVhydration and holding of her p.o. blood pressure medications.Her creatinine returned towards baseline , value is 2.3. As such ,the patient was restarted on her home Imdur on February ,2005. However , her spironolactone continued to be held. Inaddition , her torsemide was held. Her urine output wasmonitored , revealed that she put out over 2 L on her secondhospital day. As such , the patient was started on home dose ofbeta-blocker Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 aswell as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. The patient'screatinine continued to improve. It was felt that the patientwas achieving good forward systolic flow and then herhypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the130s to 150s on hospital day #2. However , over the course ofhospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluidwith a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. Asthe patient had previous admissions for pulmonary edema and CHFexacerbation , it was felt that the patient should be moreaggressively diuresed to prevent pulmonary edema. As such , thepatient restarted on her home torsemide 60 mg , however , continuedto gain weight and retained fluid. As such , the patient waschanged to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix 2 days prior to dischargeand was maintained on that dose achieving over 1 L of netdiureses on the 2 days prior to her discharge. She wasdischarged on 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix and achieves good effectand maintaining adequate blood pressure.2. Ischemia: The patient continued her home Lipitor and aspirindoses for known coronary artery disease. However , overnight , theevening of August , 2005 , and the morning of February ,2005 , she developed irritant anginal pain radiating to her jaw.Imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , butwas restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. Therewere no EKG changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes ,which were excessive , currently negative. She was maintained onaspirin , Lipitor , Imdur and p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin forthe remainder of her admission. She had no further chest painevents.3. Rhythm and rate: The patient was ventricularly paced andmaintained on telemetry. She was continued on her amiodarone 200mg p.o. daily over her hospital course and tolerated this withgood effect. She also continued her Coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o.daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic PTat 2.8. The patient had no complications or events from herrhythm or rate standpoint.4. Renal: The patient's creatinine returned to baseline byhospital day #3. It was felt that her acute and chronic renalfailure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior toadmission and subsequent hypovolemia. The patient had no furtherissues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressivehydration , taking good p.o. On November , 2005 , the patientdeveloped an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associatednausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reportedwas due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder ,identified by a CT of the abdomen without contrast within thepast year and by ultrasound in 2004. However , given thedislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may berelated to renal colic and as such , a CT of the abdomen stoneprotocol was obtained on November , 2005 , which showed noevidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once againgallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. The patient respondedwell to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution ofher symptoms by August , 2005 , hospital day #3.5. Gastrointestinal: The known biliary colic had resolved byAugust , 2005. The patient was continued on p.r.n. codeinep.o. 30 mg q.6h. and Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. p.r.n. Thepatient did not require IV morphine , requesting not to usenarcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospitalcourse.6. Endocrine: The patient was initially started on her homedose of NPH insulin 47 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. andregular insulin sliding scale. The a.m. fingersticks were low ,ranging from the 60s to the 70s as were her p.m. fingersticks.This was felt to be due to decreased p.o. in the hospitalsetting. As such , the diabetes service after consultationrecommended decreasing her NPH insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m.and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. The patient requestedminimal injections during her hospital course and at home. Assuch , there was still preprandial insulin administered , as thepatient continued to express preference for twice dailyinjections. The patient achieved goal fingersticks over herhospital course and was discharged on regimen of NPH insulin. Inaddition , a TSH was obtained during the hospital course whichshowed a level of 19 , being elevated , as such her Synthroid wasincreased to 150 mcg daily. She will follow up with herendocrinologist to repeat her TSH and hemoglobin A1c.7. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient was restartedon her K-Dur 40 mEq q.a.m. and 20 mEq q.p.m. for potassium losssecondary to diureses. Her electrolytes remained stable overcourse of her hospital stay. She was continued on alow-cholesterol low-fat diet and ADA diet.8. Infectious Disease: The patient had a UA with 8 to 10 whiteblood cells , concerning for possible low-grade UTI , especiallygiven her initial presenting symptoms. As such , she was startedon a 3-day course of Bactrim , and completed this course. Sheremained afebrile over the course of her hospitalization and herurine culture , which showed only 50 , 000 colony-forming units ofmixed flora , her white blood cell count remained within normallimits over her hospital admission. As such , no further therapywas required.9. The patient was discharged home on January , 2005 , withVNA services.PLAN FOLLOWING DISCHARGE:1. To have her endocrinologist follow up her hemoglobin A1c andto repeat her TSH level to maximize her insulin regimen as wellas her Synthroid regimen.2.

Pulses 2+ bilaterally at carotids , radials and femorals ,2+ at the right DP; left DP and bilateral PT's are present byDoppler.PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 143 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 104 ,bicarbonate 30 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.6 , glucose 87 , magnesium2.2 , BNP 18 , white blood cell count 8 , hematocrit 35.2 ,hemoglobin 11.9 , platelets 313 , PT 13.7 , INR 1 , and PTT 31.5.Carotid imaging: Left and right internal carotid arteries , bothwith 0% occlusion. Cardiac catheterization performed at Iland Frenchcal Clami General Hospital on 10/18/06 showed stenosis in the followingcoronary arteries: 70% proximal PDA , 90% proximal LAD , 70% midcircumflex with right dominant circulation. Ventriculogramshowed an ejection fraction of 35%. EKG on 4/5/06 showednormal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 63. There was poorR-wave progression in the precordial leads and inverted T wavesin leads III , V5 and V6. Chest x-ray on 4/5/06 was consistentwith congestive heart failure and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.There is mild CHF , bilateral atelectasis.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on the day prior toher scheduled surgery for completion of her preoperative workup.On 5/26/06 , she was brought to the operating room where Dr.Gonzale performed a CABG x3 using the LIMA to bypass the LAD andsaphenous vein graft to bypass the OM1 and saphenous vein graftto bypass the PDA. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 107minutes and the aortic cross-clamp time was 83 minutes. The veinwas harvested from both legs. The patient was transferred to theCardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit after her surgery where she remainedintubated for two days due to poor lungcompliance. She was also hypotensive in the postoperative periodand treated with vasoactive medications. By postoperative day#2 , the patient was extubated and hemodynamically stable ,however , she experienced atrial fibrillation overnight and herLopressor was increased. By post-operative day #3 , her atrial fibrillationwas rate controlled and she was started on Coumadin. Bypostoperative day #4 , she was ready for transfer from the ICU tothe Step-Down Unit. At that point , she was neurologically intactand her pain was well controlled. She was being treated withbeta-blockers and Coumadin for AFib. From a respiratoryperspective , the patient was being treated with aggressivepulmonary toilet and chest PT. Her chest x-ray showed a smallright pleural effusion and she was oxygenating well withsupplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's diet wasadvanced as tolerated and she exhibited adequate urine output.The patient was treated with Lasix for postoperative fluidretention. She also was seen by the Diabetes Management Servicethroughout her postoperative stay for optimal glycemic control.On the step-down Unit on postoperative day #5 , the patientexperienced a bradycardic incident with a heart rate of 38 andshe became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 after herdiltiazem was increased. She was transferred back to theIntensive Care Unit where she was observed for three more days.During that time , the patient's hemodynamics stabilized althoughshe remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation. Onpostoperative day #8 , she was ready again to transfer back to theStep-Down Unit where she spent the remaining six days of herhospital stay. The patient's chest x-ray suggested that she wasvolume overloaded and the patient was aggressively treated withLasix and Zaroxolyn as her creatinine began to increase slowlyfrom 1.3 to 1.5 to 1.7. The diuretics were decreased. A chestultrasound to evaluate pleural effusion for thoracentesisrevealed that the patient had considerable atelectasis andminimal effusion. The focus then became on chest PT , pulmonarytoilet and deep breathing and coughing. The patient continued toambulate with physical therapy and by postoperative day #13 , thepatient's chest x-ray showed improvement of the atelectasis inthe right lung and the patient had decreased oxygen requirements.From a cardiac perspective in the Step-Down Unit , the patientwas in atrial fibrillation from postoperative days #9 through #11and then converted to a sinus rhythm where she remained for thefinal three days of her hospital stay. The patient had beenstarted on Coumadin for her postoperative atrial fibrillation andthis medication should continue at least until she follow up witha cardiologist in an outpatient setting to reevaluated her heartrhythm. By postoperative day #14 , the patient was in a sinusrhythm with a stable blood pressure. She was oxygenating well onroom air and was ambulating effectively on her own. She had nocomplaints and was ready for discharge to home. On that day , hertemperature was 96.4 degrees , heart rate 76 and sinus rhythm ,blood pressure 110/60 , respiratory rate 18 , O2 saturation 94% onroom air. The patient was seven kilograms below her preoperativeweight.DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with VNA Services.DISCHARGE DIET: A low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat 2100calorie per day , 4 gm sodium per day diet.ACTIVITY: The patient should be walking as tolerated and elevateher feet with prolonged periods of sitting.FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: The patient should arrange followupappointments with her cardiologist Dr. Micheal Moresco at051-469-9935 in one to two weeks.

Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension , diabetesmellitus , hypercholesterolemia , postmenopausal , and she has nofamily history of coronary artery disease , and denies the use oftobacco. Her cardiac history is as follows: She has a history ofchronic stable angina. She underwent a cardiac catheterization inJanuary of 1992 notable for 75% OM2 lesion , 50% ostial right RCAlesion , and ejection fraction at the time was 75%. She had an ETTperformed in September of 1994 which she exercised for 3 minutes 42seconds with a peak heart rate of 127 , systolic blood pressure of156 , rate pressure product of 20k. She was stopped secondary tochest pain , she had some T wave inversions in the inferolateralleads felt to be consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia.She also had an echocardiogram performed in August of 1994 withan ejection fraction of 60-65% , no regional wall motionabnormalities. She has been followed in the ONNAW HOSPITAL Clinic by Dr.Stenehjem , maintained on the regimen of Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. ,Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , enteric coatedaspirin , and Procardia XL 60 mg q.day. She reports her angina hasbeen stable for years. She takes 1-2 sublingual nitroglycerin perweek. Her pain is typically precipitated by brisk walking or otherforms of exercises. She reports that her daily workout consists ofsome situps three times a day , and also usually a walk. She statesthat two days prior to admission while walking her normal speedtowards the bus station , she developed some right chest walltightness and shortness of breath consistent with her typicalangina. She was in the middle of the street , decided to walkacross the street with the plan to take a sublingual nitroglycerin ,however she felt light headed on continued ambulation and had asyncopal episode. She reports that on awakening she had noconfusion. She did report the loss of urine incontinence but hasurinary incontinence at baseline. She denies any stoolincontinence , no seizure activity per observers. No complicationsprior to the episode. She denies any orthopnea or PND at baseline.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Notable for coronary artery disease , asabove. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetesmellitus , she is on insulin. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5.Hypothyroidism. 6. History of guaiac positive stools. 7.History of a frozen shoulder. 8. Vitamin B 12 deficiency. 9.Gallstone disease. 10. Urinary incontinence. 11. History of acystocele.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. , NPH insulin 66 unitsq.AM and 15 units q.PM , Procardia XL 60 mgq.day , metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. , vitamin B 12 1 mg IM q.month ,Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , Synthroid .125 mg q.day , aspirin 325 mgq.day , p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin.FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease. Positivefor diabetes mellitus in her mother and herdaughter. Also positive for lung cancer.SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in Ral , Pennsylvania 83011 alone , no pets. She hasten children , 32 grandchildren , and 4 greatgrandchildren. She denies any use of tobacco or denies any use ofalcohol.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs showed a temperature of 98.9 ,heart rate of 78 , blood pressure 160/90 ,respiratory rate of 20 , with a room air saturation of 93%. Ingeneral , obese black female in no apparent distress. HEENTexamination was PERRL , EOMI , neck supple , full range of motion , shehad a soft carotid bruit on the left , no bruits on the right , and2+ pulses bilaterally. Lungs were clear. Cardiovascularexamination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a soft grade1/6 systolic ejection murmur , best heard at the left lower sternalborder. Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , non-tender ,nondistended. She was guaiac negative. Extremities showed noclubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 2+ femoral pulses , no bruits. 2+dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Neurologic examinationwas grossly nonfocal.DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: EKG on admission showed a heart rate of 73 ,intervals of .164 , .076 , .049 seconds for PR ,QRS , and QTC. Axis was 71. No Q waves and no acute ST or T wavechanges.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 ,bicarb 25 , BUN and creatinine of 16 and1.3 , glucose of 282. LFTs were within normal limits. CK of 213 ,cholesterol 179. Other labs showed a TSH of 1.5 , ferritin 181 ,TIBC of 226 , troponin I was 0.0 , hematocrit was 39.4 , white count7.15 , platelet count of 348 , 000. Coagulation studies were withinnormal limits. Urinalysis showed 2-4 WBCs , 3+ bacteria. Her urineculture revealed 50 , 000 suspected enteric gram negative rods. Thisis a urine culture from 7/24/96. A chest x-ray revealed noinfiltrates.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. CARDIAC: Cardiac wise , she ruled out for an MI by enzymes andEKG. She underwent a standard Bruce protocol ETT on 7/10/96. Sheexercised for 8 minutes , stopped secondary to fatigue. Maximumheart rate was 95 , maximum blood pressure 170/75. She developedtypical angina in her recovery which spontaneously resolved. Shehad 1 mm down sloping ST segment depressions in II , III , F , V4through V6 , which resolved into recovery. These changes weresuggestive of ischemia , but less specific because of her baselineLVH. She subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on7/28/96 , revealing a 40% left main with 90% mid RCA , 90% stenosis atthe origin of the PDA , 30% mid LAD , and 50% OM2. She subsequentlyunderwent angioplasty of the RCA and the PDA lesion on 4/1/96 withsome mild haze at the PDA. Therefore , recommendations were forheparinization for a 24 hour period. She remained pain freethroughout this hospitalization. The EPS Service saw her regardingthe issue of syncope. Further workup was performed includingcarotid ultrasounds which revealed no significant stenosis ineither of the carotid arteries. She underwent a cardiacechocardiogram on 2/4/96 to rule out evidence of regional wallmotion abnormality that might suggest the possibility of a prior MIas a source of potential ectopy. She was noted to have 2+ mitralregurgitation , noted to have an ejection fraction of 74% , and hadno reported regional wall motion abnormality. She also had noarrhythmias while on monitors throughout the hospitalization. TheEPS Service agreed with the thought that the ischemia in the RCAprobably was the most likely etiology of her syncopal episodes withpossible bradycardia during ischemic episodes. They favoredholding off on the EPS study. They felt that the revascularizationand follow-up stress testing were the recommended workup for thispatient and recommendations are for follow-up ETT in four to sixweeks. Her medical regimen was adjusted in the form of increasingher Lopressor from 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as herrate and blood pressure tolerated this regimen. She remained painfree throughout the hospitalization. She will have follow-up withher primary M.D.2. DIABETES MELLITUS: Her glucose remained under fairly goodcontrol during this hospitalization with her regimen of NPH.Hemoglobin A1C was checked and is pending at the time of discharge.3. URINARY: She was noted to have 3+ bacteria on her urinalysisand 50 , 000 colony forming units on a urine culture of 7/24/96. Wewill empirically treat her for a UTI with Bactrim 1 DS b.i.d. timesthree days.FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up will be with Dr. Amous She is to have anappointment in one to two weeks. She is also to have afollow-up ETT in four to six weeks. She should also have a repeaturine culture in the NECTON BRYIN HAWEIR HEALTH Clinic during her follow-up.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mgt.i.d. , Synthroid .125 micrograms q.day , metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. ,Procardia XL 60 mg q.day , nitroglycerin .4 mg p.r.n. , NPH insulin66 units q.AM and 15 units subcu q.PM , and Bactrim 1 DS p.o. b.i.d.times three days.DISPOSITION: Discharge to home.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good.

This is an obese female in no apparent distress ,sitting up in bed. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Scleraeanicteric. Neck: Supple , JVP at 14 cm. Chest: Cracklesbilaterally , left greater than right , half way up both lungfields with mild decreased breath sounds at the bases.Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. Nomurmur , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Soft , nontender , andnondistended with positive bowel sound and no hepatosplenomegaly.Extremities with 3+ edema as well as areas of erythematous andshiny shallow ulcerations. Neurologically , euthymic withoutfocal deficits.LABORATORY DATA: On admission , significant for sodium 147 ,potassium 3.4 , chloride 110 , CO2 26 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.6 , andglucose 69. CBC was significant for white count of 6.7 ,hematocrit 39.4 , and platelets of 258. Her CK was 432. Hertroponin was less than assay. Her BNP was greater than assay andD-dimer was 50 and 69.Chest x-ray showed decreased lung volumes with moderate cardiacenlargement. EKG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 59 ,axis of -36 and no acute changes.ASSESSMENT: This is a 63-year-old woman with history ofcongestive heart failure who presented with likely congestiveheart failure exacerbation.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: There was concern regarding acuteand subacute silent ischemia given new ST-T wave changes inlateral leads on the EKG. The patient was continued on heraspirin as well as statin. She was ruled out for an MI withnegative troponins x 3. She was continued on a low-doseshort-acting beta-blocker ( Lopressor ). She was also continued onan ACE inhibitor with this switched to captopril as ashort-acting ACE inhibitor , which was titrated up as toleratedfor a goal blood pressure of systolic of 120. An adenosine MIBIwas performed which was negative for perfusion defects. However ,echo showed global hypokinesis with depressed ejection fraction.Cardiology consult was called and they recommended further workupwith cardiac catheterization. However , the patient refused thecatheterization.Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.However , she remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout heradmission. She was monitored by cardiac telemetry with severalepisodes of 6 to 10 beats of nonsustained ventriculartachycardia. Her electrolytes were carefully monitored andrepleted as necessary. She remained asymptomatic with the runsof NSVT and was continued on her beta-blocker. Given her historyof atrial fibrillation as well as depressed ejection fraction ,she was restarted on Coumadin.Pump: The patient presented with a frank fluid overload withelevated JVP , lower extremity edema , and a BNP greater thanassay. She was aggressively diuresed with a goal of greater than-2 liters a day. She responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix t.i.d. Hercreatinine was carefully followed and did increase on 11/26/03 ,at which point diuresis was put on hold. The patient diuresedabout 3 to 4 liters each day during her hospital stay until7/7/03. At this point , she was thought to be very close toeuvolemic.Given the patient's echo findings with depressed ejectionfraction and global hypokinesis , a workup for dilatedcardiomyopathy was begun. The patient did not wish for furtherinvestigation with cardiac catheterization or a cardiac MRI. Herother labs were unremarkable including a TSH , which was normal ,an ANA which was negative , iron studies which did not show ironoverload , and thiamine which is pending at the time of thisdictation. The patient will require close followup with carefulfluid balance monitoring as well as followup with congestiveheart failure service.Pulmonary: She initially presented with shortness of breath.However , this resolved with diuresis. She has a history of PE aswell as DVT and an elevated dimer was found on admission. Therewas initial concern for pulmonary embolism , but the resolution ofsymptoms with diuresis and a history that was not suggestive ofpulmonary emboli , did not require further followup with spiralchest CT.Heme: The patient's hematocrit was followed. The patient haschronic folate and iron-deficiency anemia and she was continuedon folate and iron replacement.Endocrine: The patient was continued on NPH 20 units for herknown diabetes. Her blood sugars were in excellent control onthis regimen. Avandia was held given it contraindication inheart failure.Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.6 on admission , which is upfrom about 0.8 in October of 2003. Her urine eosinophils andsediment were unremarkable , but frank proteinuria was noted whichis consistent with her known nephrotic syndrome. Her creatinineremained stable in the 1.5 to 1.6 range until 11/26/03 , when hercreatinine bumped to 2 and kept rising until 1/28/03 , when itreached 2.7. Repeat urine electrolytes , urine eosinophils andsediment were sent at this point and they are pending at the timeof this dictation. The most likely explanation for increasingcreatinine was aggressive diuresis and intravascular volumedepletion. Diuresis was put on hold on 11/2/03 and 10/10/03.Given her increased creatinine , her ACE inhibitor dose was halfedon 10/10/03. The plan is to continue to monitor her creatininefunction , follow up on her urine chemistries and if hercreatinine resolves , to resume gentle diuresis as necessary.Infectious Disease: The patient was found to have a UTI with E.Coli that was sensitive to Bactrim and she was treated withBactrim with resolution.Rheumatological: The patient with known chronic pain as well asarthritis. Her Celebrex was held given her increased creatinineand its propensity to cause fluid retention. Her joint examrevealed swollen PIP joints of both hands as well as markedswelling over both wrists. A rheumatoid factor was sent and thatcame back negative. For her pain , she was given oxycodone p.r.n.Once her acute renal failure resolves , she may be transitionedto Celebrex or other antiinflammatory medications which may bemore effected for her arthritis. ANA came back negative.Psyche: She was continued on Celexa for depression.Code status: Full code.FOLLOWUP: The patient needs to follow up with the congestiveheart failure service as well as her primary care physician.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS ( at the time of this dictation on1/28/03 ):1.

Since then , he has been stable on medical management untilapproximately two months prior to this admission , when he begannoting anterior chest pain with exertion. He underwent a stresstest , which was found to be abnormal , and was referred for cardiaccatheterization. Cardiac catheterization was performed on9/10/06 at Au Hospital . This study revealed a70% proximal stenosis of his left anterior descending coronaryartery , a 90% mid segment stenosis of his first diagonal coronaryartery , a 50% mid segment stenosis of his circumflex coronaryartery , a 90% ostial stenosis of his first obtuse marginal , a100% proximal stenosis of his right coronary artery as well as a30% ostial stenosis of the left main coronary artery. Collateralflow was noted from the left anterior descending to the posteriordescending coronary artery. Given the results of this cardiaccatheterization , he was referred for elective revascularization.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history issignificant for hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , lower backpain , nephrolithiasis as well as a 3.4 cm infrarenal abdominalaortic aneurysm at the bifurcation of the aorta.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for open cholecystectomy inthe 1990s as well as removal of a cyst from his left wrist in2005. In addition , the patient underwent lithotripsy in July of2006.FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports a family history of coronaryartery disease. His brother has undergone coronary artery bypassgrafting in the past and his mother , father and brother all havesuffered myocardial infarction. He also has a significant familyhistory of hypertension in both of his parents.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient reports a 20-pack-year cigarettesmoking history as well as a history of social alcohol use ,approximately five to six beers on the weekend.ALLERGIES: The patient reports no known drug allergies , howevertetanus immunization in the past has led to arm swelling.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 100 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril40 mg p.o. daily , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atorvastatin 40 mgp.o. daily , fenofibrate 145 mg p.o. daily , Vicodin 5 mg p.o. asneeded for low back pain as well as vitamins C , D , A , and E.The patient was seen in the Lumne Medical Center on 10/27/06and underwent physical examination.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination at that time revealedthe patient to be afebrile with resting heart rate of 52 beatsper minute and regular. The patient had a resting blood pressureof 142/76 in the right arm and 148/76 in the left arm. He had aroom air oxygen saturation of 95%. Examination of the head ,eyes , ears , nose and throat revealed the pupils to be equal ,round , reactive to light and accommodation. The dentition waswithout evidence of infection and carotid bruits were notappreciable bilaterally over the carotid arteries. Examinationof the heart revealed it to be in regular rate and rhythm with agrade 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternalborder. Examination of the lungs revealed breath sounds to beclear bilaterally throughout all lung fields. Examination of theabdomen revealed a well-healed right upper quadrant incisionconsistent with prior open cholecystectomy. Examination of theextremities revealed them to be without scarring , varicosities oredema and pulses were 2+ and equal to full extent of allextremities. Neurologically , the patient was alert and orientedx3 with no focal neurological deficits.LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values obtained in the Landsea Charle Memorial Hospital on 10/27/06 included a sodium of 139 , potassium of3.7 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.2 , glucose of 82 , magnesium of1.6 , white blood cell count of 10.9 , hematocrit 49.2 , andplatelet count of 386 , 000. Coagulation studies were withinnormal limits with an INR of 1 and the urinalysis was withinnormal limits. Cardiac catheterization data from 9/10/06 are asstated above in the history of present illness. Echocardiogramperformed on 05/20/06 revealed a 65% ejection fraction withtrivial mitral valve insufficiency and no noted regional wallmotion abnormalities. EKG obtained on 9/10/06 showed a normalsinus rhythm at 55 beats per minute with no acute ST or T-wavechanges. Chest x-ray performed on 9/27/2006 was withoutevidence of active cardiopulmonary disease.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/26/06 as asame-day admission and was taken directly to the operating roomwhere he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4 includingthe left internal mammary artery to left anterior descendingcoronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the ramus and secondobtuse marginal coronary arteries and the left radial artery tothe right coronary artery. Significant times of this operationincluded a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 173 minutes with anaortic cross-clamp time of 156 minutes. For further details ofthis operation , please refer to the dictated operative note. Thepatient's immediate postoperative period was uncomplicated. Hewas extubated on the day of surgery and considered a goodcandidate for transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to theStep-Down Unit on postoperative day #1.

Her cardiac history begins in 1973 when she had herfirst myocardial infarction. She has had two more in 1983 and in1984. She had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1984 in which herLIMA was placed to her LAD , and the saphenous vein graft placed toher obtuse marginal and the diagonal branch. The coronary arterybypass graft in 1984 was very successful , and she has been stablesince that time without angina or congestive heart failuresymptoms. She reports that she had a negative exercise tolerancetest one year ago , Holter two to three years ago was reportedlynormal also. The only time the patient recalls having a racingheart prior to the day of admission was when her brother died twoyears ago.On the day of admission , the patient awoke with a dull ,nonradiating pain between her shoulder blades that remained untilthe patient was given 02 in the Emergency Ward which wasapproximately 12 hours after awakening. The patient was never withthis pain before the day of admission. In additional , as thepatient was walking down the street near her home on the morning ofthe day of admission , she felt herself stagger , and the worldseemed to rotate around her. She sat down for about 10 minutesuntil the spell passed. During this episode , her back pain did notchange in quality or intensity. She had no chest pain , shortnessof breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , loss of consciousness ,trauma , headache , neck stiffness , blurry vision , paroxysmalnocturnal dyspnea , or orthopnea. She does report an accompanyingracing heart that seemed regular. After this episode , the patientdrove herself to the Georgeb.sonhan Hospital Emergency Wardfor evaluation.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient had menopause at 42 years of age.She has never had a mammogram or regular breast exams. The rest ofher review of systems was noncontributory. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graftin 1984 as reported in the history of the present illness. She hashad hypertension for ten years. An echocardiogram in 3/27 showedleft ventricular enlargement , inferior apicokinesis , lateralhypokinesis , and 1+ mitral regurgitation. ALLERGIES: ToPenicillin which leads to anaphylaxis. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Were only Isordil and Cardizem. The patient has a 15 pack-yearhistory of smoking. She quit two months ago. She does not drinkalcohol or abuse IV drugs. She lives alone and is unemployed as anunemployed LPN , and has one child.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a well developed well nourishedblack female very anxious and teary eyed.Blood pressure on admission was 180/90 in the right arm and 180/95in the left arm , pulses were equal at 72. She was afebrile at98.7 , and respirations of 20. She was not orthostatic. The skinwas warm and dry. There were no rashes or bleeding. HEENT examwas benign. The neck was supple , positive jugular venousdistention at about 10 cm , but no coronary artery bruits. Thelungs were clear. The back was without costovertebral angletenderness or spinal tenderness. Cardiovascular exam: Regularrate and rhythm with an S3 and a palpable S4 , with a holosystolicmurmur at the apex and a systolic ejection murmur at the left lowersternal border. No radiation of either murmur. Her PMI wasdiffuse with a sternal heave. Abdominal exam was benign.Extremities were benign. Pulses: Femoral on the left with abruit , and 2+ femoral on the right without a bruit , and 1+. Therest of the pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally. No renal artery bruitswere heard. Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented ,and her exam was nonfocal.LABORATORY DATA: On admission showed a normal SMA-7. Herhematocrit was 41.5 with a low MCV at 78.7 , lowMCH at 31.3 , and a RDW of 16.1. The patient ruled out for amyocardial infarction with normal CK's. Her chest x-ray showed aglobular heart , question of some cardiomegaly , clearly postcoronary artery bypass graft with lots of clips. She had rightatrial enlargement with loss of the retrosternal air space , but noevidence of aortic widening of the mediastinum. No pulmonaryedema , no pulmonary vascular redistribution was detected. EKGshowed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with a PR interval of .14 , QRS.11 , and a QT of .45. She had left atrial enlargement , old lateralT-wave inversions as well as inferior T-wave inversions. Thepatient had no acute changes.HOSPITAL COURSE: Involved placing the patient on a cardiacmonitor , rule her out for an myocardialinfarction , obtaining exercise stress test , echocardiogram , drawingblood for thyroid function tests , VMA's , metanephrines in theurine. In addition , a beta blocker was added to her hypertensiveregimen , and she was started on an aspirin a day. Her cardiacmonitor demonstrated no dysrhythmias except for a few PVC's. Theresults of the 24 hour Holter on discharge were still pending. Sheruled out for a myocardial infarction. An exercise stress testshowed that the patient went 5 minutes and 45 seconds on a standardBruce protocol , no ischemic symptoms , stopped due to leg pains.EKG was with 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in V4 and V5. It wasreportedly consistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Becauseof this , the patient should probably have an exercise MIBI on theoutside as an outpatient. An echocardiogram demonstrated anejection fraction of 45-50% , severe hypokinesis of theanterolateral and posterior wall , akinesis of the inferior wall ,2-3+ mitral regurgitation , and an intra-atrial septal aneurysm , notumor or thrombus was detected.Laboratory studies on admission did demonstrate an elevated proteinof 8.5 and a globulin fraction of 4.2. Therefore , an S-PEP , IgGand IgM's were sent and were pending on discharge.DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. ,Cardizem 60 mg q.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , and anAspirin a day.

The patientand the daughter report that she had been improving steadilyuntil this point. Given the development of these symptoms , whileon levofloxacin and Flagyl since her last discharge , she wastransferred back to the Stanuck Medical Center Emergency Departmentfor further workup. In the emergency department , her temperaturewas 101. The labs were remarkable for white count 27 withoutbands , hematocrit of 32.1 , creatinine 1.3 up from her baseline of1. A urinalysis showed white blood cells too numerous to countand 2+ bacteria with 3+ yeast. Chest x-ray in the emergencydepartment showed no definite consolidation and no definite acuteprocess. At that time , she was alert and oriented. She receivedTylenol , levofloxacin , Flagyl and cefuroxime in the EmergencyDepartment.

Blood smear showed 1+ target cells , ____ , andtear drops.HOSPITAL COURSE: She was admitted to the floor.1. ID. She was initiated on cefuroxime q.12h. , levofloxacin ,and Flagyl. Urine culture showed greater than 100 , 000 yeast ,likely explained by persistent Foley catheter and perineal yeastinfection. Her Foley was changed upon admission to the floor.Blood culture was negative as was the stool culture. The patientcontinued to be febrile and had elevated white count despiteantibiotic therapy without fevers , so the antimicrobial therapywas discontinued on hospital day #3. Evaluation by theInfectious Disease team with further studies did not yield aclear source of infection. Therefore , Rheumatology consult wascalled.2. Rheumatology: Evaluation by the Rheumatology Service lead tojoint aspirations performed in the right MCP and right kneejoints , which revealed fluid with around 2000 white blood cellsand both negatively by refringent and positively by refringentcrystals consistent with gout and pseudogout. DVT was ruled outas a cause of this extremity swelling. The patient was startedon Colchicine with improvement of pain and decrease of jointswelling. An intraarticular ankle injection of Depo-Medrol wasperformed on 7/9/05 with good affect. By the 6/13/05 , thepatient reported marked improvement in her range of motion andpain control.3. Endocrine: The patient was initially maintained on her rehabdose of insulin which was Lantus 18 units at night , aspart 4units at meals plus a sliding scale of Novolog. However , due tointermittent decreased p.o. intake , she suffered several episodesof hypoglycemia with blood sugars in the 30s to 50s. Her insulindosing was titrated initially downward and then after sheincreased her p.o. intake it was titrated upwards. Pancreaticenzymes were given with meals.4.

Thepatient was found to be febrile with leukocytosis in the ED. Thepatient had been seen previously in the ED on 10/11/06 at whichtime she was treated with a UTI. She was sent home with aseven-day course of ciprofloxacin and oxycodone for pain. Theciprofloxacin was renally dosed. The patient reports that shestopped taking oxycodone and ciprofloxacin. After developingconstipation , it is unclear if she completed her full course ofantibiotics. She currently present with complaints of diarrheain the setting of having taken laxative at home. No melena orhematochezia. The pain is not related to food , urination , ordefecation. She has poor p.o. intake , denies any sick contactsat home. No recent travel.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:Positive for blood sugars ranging from 180-190 , although she hada blood sugar of 499 on the morning of admission. She hasfatigue but no myalgias , no cough , chest pain , shortness ofbreath , no dysuria. In the ED , she was given ampicillin 2 g IV ,gentamicin 80 mg IV , Flagyl 500 mg IV and 8 units of insulin.ALLERGIES:Medication reaction , she has an allergy to lisinopril withreaction of elevated creatinine at a low dose. To levofloxacin ,she has reflux and celecoxib gives her dizziness and elevatedcreatinine.BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:She had a temperature of 101 , pulse of 106 , blood pressure172/71 , oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She was alert andoriented x3 , in mild distress. Her lungs were clear toauscultation bilaterally. Her heart had a regular rate andrhythm with a 2/6 early systolic murmur at the left lower sternalborder. She was obese , but had a nontender , nondistended abdomenwith normal abdominal bowel sounds. She was guaiac negative , andher left foot was in a cast.PERTINENT LABORATORY TESTS AND RESULTS:She had a sodium of 127 , corrected to 131 with her glucose ,potassium of 4.9 , bicarbonate of 27 , BUN 95 , creatinine 4.5 ,glucose 329. LFTs were normal , amylase 19 , lipase 8 , negativeketo acids in the serum and urine. Her white blood count was26.8 , INR was 1.4 , PTT was 36.6. She had a dirty urinalysis.She had an abdominal CT that showed a non-incarcerated hernia , noevidence of colitis.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:The patient had a debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06. Shealso had hemodialysis initiated on 10/9/06.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Infectious disease: The patient's left foot was encasted byorthopedics surgery on 2/29/06 with evidence of underlyinginfection. Her wound cultures grew MRSA with probes to the bone.X-rays were unrevealing and MRI showed severe osteomyelitis. Inaddition , the patient had an ESR of 109. The patient was thusput on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl. Blood cultures from6/16/06 additionally grew gram-positive cocci in clusters whicheventually yielded MRSA. However , surveillance cultures withtreatment on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl were negative.The patient received debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06.In the OR , the bone looked necrotic and infected. The bone wassent to pathology and microbiology , the results of which arepending. Given the appearance of her bone during debridement , itis presumed that the patient will need eight weeks of vancomycin.Because she did have a clear source of fevers after it was foundthat she had osteomyelitis , the patient was discontinued offFlagyl and levofloxacin on 5/6/06.2. GI: The patient has abdominal pain with gastric emptyingstudy on 6/16/06 showing 0% clearance at 90 minutes consistentwith severe gastroparesis versus obstruction. Radiology did notfeel that an upper GI series would give further informationregarding obstruction and it was judged to be unlikely given thatthe patient has bowel movements and rare emesis. Later on in thehospital course , the patient was put on erythromycin with adecrease in her symptoms of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting.The patient did have any evidence of bowel ischemia on MRA.Later , erythromycin was changed to Reglan on 4/8/06 per renalrequest during hemodialysis. There is no evidence of pancreatisor liver disease and the patient was also kept on Compazine fornausea.3. Renal: The patient had , on admission , acute on chronic renalfailure. There was a concern for prerenal azotemia in thesetting of nausea and vomiting and diarrhea. She had afractional excretion of sodium which was 0.3% , but it wasdifficult to interpret in the setting of end-stage renal disease.Lasix and Cozaar were held. However , the creatinine continuedto worsen reaching 6.1 on 9/14/06. Renal was consultedregarding the need for dialysis. On admission , the patient didhave matured AV fistula graft and she was thus started onhemodialysis on 10/9/06.4. Hematology: The patient had an INR which was elevated.Hematocrit was also decreased to 25.5 from 34. She was guaiacnegative and did have any schistocyte. Her LDH was also normalwith her haptoglobin high. It was judged from her iron studiesthat the patient was iron deficient. She was put on ironsupplementation. She also was felt to have renal component toher anemia and she was started on darbepoetin initially andchanged to erythropoietin later during dialysis by renal.5. Cardiovascular: The patient was maintained on aspirin , astatin , and calcium channel blocker. She started prophylacticbeta-blocker during her hospital course as well.6. Endocrine: The patient had hemoglobin A1c of 7.8. She wastransitioned to NPH and Aspart during her hospital stay. She hadintermittent problems with hypoglycemia in the setting of beingNPO pending operations and procedures; however , her insulinregimen was titrated to good glycemic response.7. Prophylaxis: The patient was kept on heparin and Nexium.8. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: Her IV fluids werestopped as the patient was oliguric and anuric initially beforehemodialysis. Later on , she was also put on 1500 mL fluidrestriction. Later on during dialysis , her volume statusresolved euvolemia. She was kept on a low fat and lowcholesterol diabetic diet.

In ED the patient received 5 liters of IVF and 36U ofinsulin. His blood pressure stabilized with volume and he wastransfered to the medical floor.ENDOCRINE - DMII but with history of pancreatitis so behaves more liketype 1 - needs insulin all the time. Per patient he had been taking 20units of Lantus QAM but patient admitted to poor compliance with bothdiet and insulin. His A1C was checked and returned at 19. The patientwas started on Lantus and Lispro and maintained on an ADA diet. He wastitrated to 20 units of Lantus QHS and was requring Lispro for FSranging from 120-600. By 8/22 his FS remained better controlled butwere still high ranging from 200 to 400 on Lantus 16. On 3/22 thepatient expressed that he would like to leave. He is discharged on Lantus 20 and Lispro SS with VNA to follow finger sticks. Hewas maintained on an ADA diet , however , there was some concern hemay have been eating sweets on his own.

He notes a productive cough , asubjective fever and nausea and vomiting at home. He wassubsequently seen in Electrophysiology Clinic. He had a lowgrade fever of 100.0 at that time. He was electively admittedbut on the way to the floor , his ICD fired again. He was givenlidocaine and after a third firing of his ICD , he was begun onamiodarone. The patient then became short of breath and was inpulmonary edema , requiring intubation. Chest x-ray showed aright upper lobe white out. The patient was taken to Cath forpossible ischemia contributing to his ventricular fibrillation.He had a proximal 80% LAD lesion and a mid 70% LAD lesion whichwere both stented with Seifer stents. He also had a 60% D1lesion which was angioplastied to a residual 40% lesion. He alsohad a 70% left circumflex lesion. After catheterization , thepatient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. He wascontinued on his amiodarone load. He had no further arrhythmiasduring his ICU stay. He was extubated the following day and wasdiuresed for congestive heart failure. He also began treatmentfor both community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.He was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on May ,2005.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , EF of 15% , statuspost ICD and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis ,paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , diabetes , chronic renalinsufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , andhypothyroidism.HOME MEDICATIONS:1.

JVP of 14 cm. Lungs with bibasilar rales. Cardiac examrevealed a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen was soft with apulsatile liver and mild right lower quadrant tenderness with norebound or guarding. His extremities had trace pitting edema.Examination of his skin revealed vesicles at the sternum abovethe nipple line with a papular rash extending in a dermatomalpattern around to the right side of the back to the midline aswell as extension down the inner portion of his upper arm.LABS: Labs were significant for a creatinine of 2.1 , and anegative troponin on the day of admission.IMPRESSION: 75-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathyadmitted with ventricular fibrillation of unclear etiology ,though possibilities include underlying infection or cardiacischemia.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Cardiovascular: The patient was taken to the Cath Lab andhad stents placed in the LAD with other residual diseaseremaining. The patient was continued on a regimen of aspirin ,Plavix and a statin. The patient often refused to take thestatin , though this was recommended. He was also started on alow dose of ace inhibitor which the patient frequently refused aswell. We would recommend starting a beta-blocker when thepatient is more stable. The patient continued to be diuresedwith Lasix until he was uvolemic and then resumed his home doseof Lasix 80 mg daily. An echo during admission showed an EF of15% with moderate aortic stenosis. For his episodes ofventricular fibrillation , the patient was begun on an amiodaroneload with a goal of a total of 10 grams at which point he shouldbe tapered to 40 mg per day. He has one day remaining of hisamiodarone load and should begin the 400 mg per day dose on September , 2005. He was monitored on telemetry without significantevent. The patient should follow up with Dr. Kolopajlo inElectrophysiology Clinic.2. Infectious Disease: The patient was treated for bothcommunity acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia withcefotaxime , azithromycin and Flagyl. The patient completed a5-day course of azithromycin. He is still in the process ofcompleting a total 10 day course of cephalosporin and Flagyl. Hehas one more day of therapy remaining. The patient was alsonoted to have shingles. The patient reports experiencing painthat started on his back before the rash appeared. The rash waspresent prior to admission. He was started on acyclovir on May , 2005 and this was stopped on November , 2005 given that therewas likely little utility of treatment begun greater than 48hours into the course and because the patient preferred not totake the medication.3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with abaseline creatinine of 1.5. Creatinine was initially elevated to2.1 , but improved back to baseline prior to discharge.4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes , but was onno medications as an outpatient. He received a diabetic diet andwas treated with a regular insulin sliding scale duringadmission. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 , indicating poor glycemiccontrol. He was started on a low dose of glipizide and theregular insulin sliding scale was discontinued. The patient alsohas a history of hypothyroidism. TSH was checked and was 1.6 ,which is within normal limits. The patient was also noted tohave a low calcium level and was found to be vitamin D deficient.We have started supplementation of vitamin D.5. Heme: The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillationand low ejection fraction. The patient's Coumadin was initiallyheld but then restarted on October , 2005. He is nowtherapeutic. Goal INR is 2-3. He will need to be monitored andCoumadin adjusted as needed. The patient also has irondeficiency anemia. He will need GI evaluation in the future. Hewas begun on iron supplementation , however , the patientfrequently refuses to take this medication.6. Prophylaxis: The patient is therapeutic on Coumadin.7. Code status: The patient is full code.FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:1. Blood draw in 2-3 days to monitor INR and creatinine. Pleaseadjust Coumadin dose for a goal INR of 2-3.2.

Inher first trip to the emergency department her pain was diffuse andwas thought to be gastroenteritis. After being sent home , she hadan increase in pain and vomiting and was unable to tolerate p.o. Onher second trip one day later she was vomiting with no fever butchills and no flatus. The decision was made to take her to theoperating room to explore for appendicitis.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,diet controlled.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None.MEDICATION: None.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a morbidly obese woman inno acute distress. She was tachycardic.Chest was clear. Abdomen was soft with positive bowel sounds ,tenderness in the right and left lower quadrant with positive psoasand Rovsing's sign. Rectal examination showed normal tone and nostool. Pelvic examination showed no cervical motion tenderness.LABORATORY: Abdominal CT was obtained which showed 5x5 cm cecalthickening with extraluminal air. This was thought to be consistent with aperforated appendicitis or phlegmon. CBC showed a white bloodcount 19 , 000. Her urine HCG was negative.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room onMay , by Dr. Jenovese , who initially opened theright lower quadrant to explore for appendicitis. In exploring theabdomen , purulent material was found in the right lower quadrant ,and the appendix was not able to be visualized. The decision wasmade to open the midline incision which was done. Details of theoperation may be found in Dr. Zinsli 's operative report. Byreport , she had gangrenous portions of the right colon ,necessitating a right colectomy. This was performed , and shetolerated the procedure well and was transferred extubated instable condition to the floor. Her immediate postoperative coursewas complicated by supraventricular tachycardia to a rate of 200with hypotension , requiring beta blockade and adenosine. She wastransferred to the Surgical ICU for further management. After theuse of beta blockade and adenosine , her arrhythmia resolved. Thiswas found to occur with magnesium of 1.5 which was repleted. Perrecommendations of the Cardiology Service , an echocardiogram wasobtained which was normal , and she ruled out for myocardialinfarction by serial CKs and electrocardiograms. An NG tube was inplace which was continued on the first postoperative day , and shewas kept on Zantac. She was kept on ampicillin , levofloxacin andFlagyl. A central line was in place. Over the next fewpostoperative days , as her NG tube was removed and her diet slowlyadvanced with sips , she was converted to p.o. medication. At onepoint she developed a second episode of supraventriculartachycardia and was thought to be either atrial fibrillation versussinus tachycardia. This did not respond immediately to Lopressorand per Cardiology's recommendations , she was changed to diltiazemfollowed by Diltiazem drip. When stabilized , her dose of Lopressorwas increased , Diltiazem stopped and she was converted to p.o.Lopressor 50 t.i.d. which kept her in sinus rhythm and a stablerate. By the third and fourth postoperative day , she wastolerating a regular diet , passing flatus and bowel movements andambulating independently. She was weaned off her oxygen and hercentral line was discontinued. She was stable for discharge.The patient was discharged to home on August , 2000. At that timeshe will have completed a 5-day course of ampicillin , levofloxacinand Flagyl. She is tolerating a regular diet , ambulatingdependently and requiring minimal amounts of oral analgesics. Shereceived wet to dry dressing changes b.i.d. to her wounds , whichwill need to be continued as an outpatient by a visiting nurse.DISCHARGE MEDICATION: Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Percocet 1-2tabs p.o. q 3-4 hours p.r.n. pain , Colace 100mg b.i.d. while on Percocet.FOLLOWUP: The patient is instructed to followup with Dr. Goanin 1-2 weeks and should call his office for anappointment.Dictated By: JOEL J.

He underwentpolypectomy at that time without complication , but on the day ofadmission noted bright red blood per rectum. Additionally he felt weak andlightheaded and presented to the ED where his initial vital signs showed ablood pressure 105/48 and heart rate of 60. He subsequentlybecame hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.Labs showed a hematocrit of 28 , down from a prior hematocrit of43 in April . He was given a liter of IV fluids with moderateimprovement and was evaluated by the GI Service. GI at that timefelt the source was most likely secondary to the polypectomysite. He was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring with aplanned colonoscopy the following day.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.

Over the first couple of days in intensivecare , he received 8 to 9 units of packed red blood cells and On hospital day#2 , he underwent an embolization of the ileocecal artery with subsequentimprovement in clinical picture. Over the next couple of days , he continued tohaveguaiac-positive and melena stools but with stabilization in hishematocrit. A repeat colonoscopy was completed on 11/22/2006 ,which showed a single white ulcer in the colon thought to be theold polypectomy site but no signs of new or old blood.Throughout the rest of his hospitalization , his hematocritremained stable and he was maintained on PPIs twice a day.Renal: The patient has end-stage renal disease onhemodialysis three times a week. This was continued during hishospitalization. He has had recurrent issues with AV fistulafailure. On admission , he was relying on the left lowerextremity shunt. There was a hardened area proximal to the shuntfound on physical exam and an absence of a thrill atthe site. Per Renal recommendation , this was evaluatedwith an AV fistulogram and a subsequent ultrasound. Theultrasound revealed that there was complex fluid collectionproximal to his AV graft.

She initally had difficultymaintaining her blood sugars and was given another amp of d50 andorange juice on the floor. After the first 12 hours , her blood sugarshave been consistently over 120. Although she was very enzyme posivefor NSTEMI ( MB 31.2-->32.4-->15.4 today ) , chest pain did not recur. INfact , her EKG has been normal since arriving on the floor. Therefore ,her episode of ischemia was thought to be demand related ischemia inthe context of hypoglycemia. Causes of the hypoglycemia included hypothyroidism , adrenal insufficiency , and iatrogenesis. Given the finiteduration of the hypoglycemia , the latter possibility was deemed mostlikely ( TSH , AM cortisol wnl ). The patient's cardiac enzymes havepeaked ( MB: 31.2-->31.4--> 15.4 ). The patient's home situation has beenpreviouisly known to be suboptimal--she had a son who may have beendealing drugs in her home 2 years ago. This time , there was concernover potential tension betwee her and her estranged husband ormedication errors. Social work was called and spoke with the daughter.She appears to be appropriately concerned about her mother's healthand open to the idea of placement in an assisted living facility atsome later date. It is clear that an elaborate and effective system hasbeen worked out to monitor and treat the patient's blood sugars. Thepatients visiting nurse service ( Lan Xiemore Medical Center ) was contacted to reemphasizethe importance of evaluating the patient's medication regimen. Thenurse involved in the patient's care also will initiate a requestfor a home health aide to visit the patient more frequently. Elderservices was informed to initiate a consult. The social worker atCentter Ing Community Hospital was also informed of this admission. Thepatient's home situation is deemed safe for discharge. She willfollow up with Dr. Fowlie on November VNA will visit hertommorrow. The patient's hematocrit dropped slightly the day of discharge. However , the patient was guaiac negative. Parenthetically , thepatient had a slightly dirty UA on admission. She was initially treatedbut given her lack of symptoms , this was discontinued.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your insulin dosage has been decreased because your blood sugar was toolow. Your visiting nurse should check your blood sugars and call yourphysician if they are consistently above 150.

FANKHAUSER , ALLAN JAMEON 9 of September INTERNALIZATION OF LEFTSTENT BY DR. SCHOCK , TOM GREGORY ON12 of NovemberHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61 year old femalewho underwent a left ureterallithotomy in 1985. She subsequently developed a left ureteralstricture at the pelvic brim , which was balloon dilated in 18 of NovemberThe patient received 2-1/2 years of relief , but the presented withleft flank pain and left hydronephrosis in 23 of September She had reliefwith a left percutaneous nephrostomy , and later another balloondilatation. She had a third balloon dilatation in 7 of March , and thiswas of a 4-centimeter segment. A stent was left in place. Thestent presently is within the ureter. The patient now presents forthe above-mentioned procedure. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was as above.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY was as above , plus thyroid cyst excision ,liposuction of bilateral lower extremities , cholecystectomy ,appendectomy , vein stripping , carpal tunnel release bilaterally ,and tubal ligation. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Levothyroxine0.025 milligrams 2 tablets per day , Motrin as needed , Tylenol asneeded , Percocet as needed. ALLERGIES included penicillin whichcaused a rash.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese female in no acutedistress. Head , eyes , ears , nose and throatexamination was clear. Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.Back has no costovertebral angle tenderness. Lungs were clear.Heart had regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen was obese , soft ,nondistended , nontender , good bowel sounds , multiple surgical scarsalong the abdomen which were well-healed. Rectal examinationshowed increased tone , tender secondary to hemorrhoid. Neurologicexamination was grossly nonfocal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , hematocrit was 29.7 ,prothrombin time 11.8 , partialthromboplastin time 21.2.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 25 of June , for aprocedure on 9 of September She underwent theabove-mentioned procedure without difficulty. The patient did lose1 liter of blood , however , and received 2 units of autologouspacked red blood cells as well as 4 , 000 cc of lactated Ringer's and2 , 000 cc of Hespan and 500 cc of albumin. In the operating room ,they found the left distal ureteral stricture , approximately 8centimeters with a small stone cluster. The patient left theoperating room in stable condition with a Foley to gravity , a7-French single pigtail external ureteral stent , as well as aJackson-Pratt drain to suction. Postoperatively , the patient didwell. She did have a low hematocrit in the immediate postoperativeperiod requiring 2 units of blood. Her level was 21.9. Otherwise ,electrolytes were stable and the patient was doing well. Thepatient was taken to the ward for the remainder of herpostoperative care. We kept her on intravenous antibiotics andnothing-per-oral until she passed flatus , at which point she wasable to tolerate a diet. Because of the duration of surgery , aswell as her large size , pulmonary toilet was encouraged with thepatient. On postoperative day #3 , the patient persisted with afever of unknown origin , again thought to be respiratory asmentioned above. Cultures were taken and she remained onantibiotics. Stentogram was done on postoperative day #10. Thisshowed extravasation of fluid distally in the ureter. Cystogramshowed no bladder extravasation. With that in mind , the Foley wastaken out and the stent was left in place. It was anticipated thatshe would be taken back another time for stent removal. Thepatient was discharged on 15 of May The external stent had actuallybeen switched over to an internal stent at the time of discharge.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. CONDITION ONDISCHARGE was stable. The patient was to FOLLOW-UPwith Dr. Kent J.

Please also see that for the initialhospital course this dictation only goes from Augustthrough 3/24/07.1. Orthopedics. There is no update on his orthopedics course.He needs to continue his heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twicedaily for one month following his surgery , which was 7/11/07 , sohe just about to complete this one month course. He should be onUltram 50 mg every twelve hours as needed for pain. Allnarcotics should be avoided as these results in severe deliriumfor Mr. PuotinenNo update to cardiovascular ischemia.Cardiovascular rhythm. His Lopressor continued to be held forthe remainder of his hospitalization. His blood pressure waswithin normal limits between 100-110/60-70 and his heart rateremained in the 60s-70s , no higher than the 80s. If his bloodpressure increases , starting Lopressor again at 25 mg twice dailywould be wise , however , currently his blood pressure is not highnor does his rate require this.There is no uptake to his renal course. He continued on hisdialysis on Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturdays. However , he alsogot dialysis on Friday the 6 of July since he is being dischargedtoday , so that he can be changed to a Monday , Wednesday , andFriday dialysis course at the Ans General Medical CenterFrom an endocrine perspective , he remained on sliding scaleinsulin only. He did not need to be restarted on his Lantus.There is no further update to his GI oncologic history. Heshould continue to follow up with Dr. Trimboli on in 4/15/07 at3:00 p.m.From a delirium perspective , his Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime wasdiscontinued after his sense of delirium has been cleared formultiple days. However , if he were to start to have any sorts ofhallucinations or issues with confusion , we would restart theZyprexa immediately 2.5 mg at bedtime +2.5 mg as needed. Thepatient is currently stable again off Zyprexa , but it has onlybeen discontinued for two days , so he may well need this to beadded on. As soon as the Zyprexa is added on , he has cleared hisdelirium pretty quickly , so this has been quite effective forhim.From an ID perspective. He was continued on his rifampin 300 mgtwice daily as well as his penicillin 2 million units every fourhours and these antibiotics should be continued through 12/10/07.He has an appointment with Dr. Kerschner in the ID Clinic on8/20/07 at 8:00 a.m. to follow up on these issues. Please makesure that the patient attends this appointment as it is veryimportant in terms of deceptive time running any changes in hisantibiotic course. He completed his course of Valtrex and doesnot need any further treatment with Valtrex.Gout. The patient developed gout in his right MCP and PIP jointsseveral days prior to discharge. He was restarted on hiscolchicine every other day. He was also started on a higher doseof prednisone of 20 mg daily. This should be continued for fiveadditional days and then he can be decreased back down to 10 mgfor several days and then down to his baseline dose of 5 mgdaily. He should continue on 5 mg of prednisone daily for theforeseeable future.From an FEN perspective , Nutrition was following the patient andthey recommended that he has his phosphorous checked regularlyand that he have assistance with his meals as much as possible sothat he can eat as much as possible.From a hyponatremia perspective , his sodium was improved at thetime of this dictation and in fact on discharge , his sodium was132. He should continue on free water restriction at theKing Ch Memorial Hospital as his hyponatremia is likely fromhypervolemic hyponatremia given his low albumin and poor oncoticpressure.Code status , the patient will continue to be full code at thetime of this discharge addendum.TO DO: Please make sure the patient continues with hisantibiotics through 7/4/07 also make sure that he sees Trey Kachmarsky in the ID Clinic on 8/20/07 at 8 a.m. Please also makesure that he sees Dr. Ronald Treiber at the Fullming Skaggs Ingoernstrong Rid Health on 4/15/07 at 3 p.m. as well as Dr. Milton Fiero on2/5/07 11:30 a.m. He should also follow up with his primarycare physician , Dr. Criqui following discharge from Faxventci Medical CenterDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.

She was treated wtih conservativemanagement. No NGT was required. The SBO resolved and she was passingstool and tolerating a normal diet.-CV: She has a history of diastolic dysfunction. Echo 8/27 with EF 45-50% ,no RWMA , mod LAE and RAE , bioprosthetic MV w/ tr MR , tr AR , severe TR ,mild-mod PR. She reported SOB prior to admission which ws thought to bedue to a CHF exacerbation. She was not agressively diuresed in thesetting of the partial SBO. She is on variable doses of lasix( 80-200mg po bid ) at home. She was initially given lasix 80mg bid whichrequired additional doses of lasix iv prn to diurese , so the dose wasincreased to 160mg po bid. Repeat CXR on 3/17 looks a little better thanadmission. Overall her SOB and hypoxia improved. She no longer requiredsupplemental oxygen. She has a history of hypertension and was continuedon norvasc and imdur. She also has a history of Afib , now on coumadin.Her rate was adequately controlled. The coumadin was initially held dueto possible procedures related to the SBO. The INR remained in 2-3 range ,likely due to the antibiotics. The Coumadin was restarted on 10/20 as theINR was trending down , and was started at lower dose ( 2mg instead of 3mg )given the antibiotics. Her INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted asan outpatient.-Pulmonary: She has a history of aspiration PNA. The Abd CT showedbilateral lower lobe PNA , likely aspiration. She was treated with levoand flagyl. Her WBC was elevated on admission and decreased duringhospitalization. She was afebrile. With treatment of the pneumonia andCHF she was no longer hypoxic or SOB. She will continue levofloxacin andflagyl for an 8-day course.-Renal: She has a history of CKD with Cr baseline of 2.6-2.8. Her Cr was2.6 on admission and 2.3 on discharge. She continued home sevelamer.-Diabetes: Her insulin was initially held on admission due to NPO for theSBO. When her SBO resolved and she was eating again , her home regimen oflantus 100 units daily , Novolog 5 units qac , and Novolog sliding scalewas restarted. Her fingersticks continued to be high , perhaps due topneumonia. The insulin was titrated up for better glucose control toLantus 12 units daily , Novolog 7 units qac , and Novolog sliding scale.The daughter is a nurse and will monitor and adjust her insulin at home.HbA1c 8.2.-ID: Treatment for aspiration pneumonia as above with levofloxacin andflagyl. Ucx with mixed flora.-Heme: Hct at baseline. As above , her INR remained high off coumadin ,likely due to the antibiotics. Coumadin restarted on 10/20 at a lowerdose. INR will be followed and coumadin adjusted as an outpatient-Nutrition: She had a radiologic swallowing evaluation which showed deeplaryngeal penetration with thin and nectar-thick liquid with noaspiration and a tiny Zenker diverticulum. Diet recommendations wereground diet ( for lack of teech ) and thin liquids.-Disposition: PT recommended rehab. Patient and daughter prefer patient togo home w/ services. The daughter is a nurse.

Upon admission , thereasons for the patient's chest pain were unclear. Her cardiacenzymes were negative and her EKG was unchanged. Chest x-ray wasnegative for infiltrate. However , soon after the patient wasadmitted to the floor she had high fevers and grew outmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from her blood.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Dermatomyositis diagnosed in 2006.2. Insulin-dependent diabetes complicated by neuropathy.3. Hypertension.4. History of Graves' disease status post radiotherapy.5. Rheumatoid arthritis/rheumatologic overlap syndrome.6. Status post SBO.7. B12 deficiency.8. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy ( ejection fraction 45% ).ALLERGIES: Penicillin , aspirin , codeine , Zocor.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone in Ent Saint Shehas a home VNA two times per week. She is a former smoker , butdenies IV drug use and ethanol use.STUDIES:1. Transthoracic echocardiogram performed on March , 2006revealed a left ventricle normal in size. Estimated ejectionfraction was 55% ( previous echocardiograms had showed an ejectionfraction of 45% ). There were no regional wall motionabnormalities. There was no significant pericardial effusion.No vegetations were seen.2. Transesophageal echocardiogram performed on May , 2006revealed a normal left ventricular wall thickness with noregional wall motion abnormalities , trace mitral regurgitationwas seen. There was no evidence of valvular vegetations orabscesses.3. A CT scan of the chest without contrast on August , 2006 showeda slight soft tissue prominence at the costosternal joint , but noabscess and no bone destruction was seen. There was no drainablefluid collection or bone destruction seen on the scan. MRI onMay , 2006 revealed a linear low signal within the sternumsuspicious for a fracture with adjacent rim-enhancing collectionextending both anterior and posterior to the sternum , suspiciousfor an abscess. Hematoma is also possible.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular: The patient had a negative rule outmyocardial infarction protocol. She was maintained on herantihypertensive medications during her hospitalization and shewas hemodynamically well controlled. Because the patient hadMRSA bacteremia upon admission and because the patient hadelevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as a possiblediagnosis. TTE and TEE , however , showed no vegetations on thepatient's valves. The patient's CRP on May , 2006 was 135 , thepatient's ESR on November , 2006 was 90.2. Infectious disease: The patient had fevers upon admission togreater than 101. Initial blood cultures revealed four of fourbottles to be MRSA bacteremia. Despite treatment withvancomycin , the patient also had positive blood cultures on August , 2006. At the time of this dictation , the patient had negativeblood cultures from September , 2006 through March , 2006. She had abandemia to 6 on admission. It was not obvious initially whatthe source was of the patient's MRSA bacteremia. Given herelevated ESR and CRP , endocarditis was entertained as adiagnosis. However , both TTE and TEE showed no evidence ofvegetations on the valves. The patient had a soft tissueprominence on examination over her sternal manubrial joint on theright side of her sternum. The original CT scan showed a softtissue prominence but no fluid collection. However , MRI on May , 2006 showed evidence of an abscess or hematoma in the rightsubpectoral region. The patient had a CT-guided aspirationperformed on February , 2006 and 15 mL of pus was removed. Thedrain was left in place. Studies from this fluid were pending atthe time of this dictation. However , the Thoracic SurgeryService was consulted for possible debridement of the wound.Infectious disease service was also consulted concerning thetiming for the placement of the PICC line , as well as theduration of the patient's vancomycin.3. Musculoskeletal: Chest x-ray showed evidence of an old leftshoulder fracture.4. Rheumatology: The patient was maintained on prednisone fordermatomyositis.5. Endocrine: The patient was maintained on her home dose ofNPH. On this dose , the patient's blood sugars were wellcontrolled. The patient's TSH was measured A6 at 5.129 with a T4of 7.2 and a THBR of 1.27. The patient's dose of Synthroid wasnot altered.6. Hematology: The patient was anemic on admission withhematocrits ranging from 24-29. B12 level on November , 2006 was199. She was given supplementation , both orally and IM , and onNovember , 2006 her B12 level was 842. She was also found to haveboth iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Ironstudies from September , 2006 revealed an iron less than assay , a TIBCof 202 , and ferritin 182. The patient was started on oral ironsupplementation during her hospitalization.7. Skin: The patient was noted to have excoriations and openlesions on her legs , which were likely due to itching. Thepatient was given Bactroban. All of these excoriations wereclean , dry and intact. There was no evidence of infection.9. Neurologic: The patient was maintained on amitriptyline andNeurontin during her hospital stay.10. Renal: On November , 2006 , the patient had a creatinine to1.7. It is the feeling of the team that this is due togentamicin toxicity. At one point during the patient'shospitalization , gentamicin had been added for synergistic effectwith vancomycin. Gentamicin had been added as the patient wascontinuing to spike fevers despite vancomycin treatment. Whenthe patient's creatinine began to rise , gentamicin wasdiscontinued. Creatinine will likely resolve with time withoutgentamicin administration in the future.A component of the arf was due to repeated gadolidium exposure from repeatmri of sternum and a hemodynamic with worsening when acei reinitiated.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: March , 2006: In general , the patient isfatigued and somnolent. At multiple times during the patient'shospitalization , she became difficult to arouse. Upon touchingher sternum , however , the patient opened her eyes and was alertand oriented. This seems to be her baseline behavior. There wasno lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular exam revealed regular rateand rhythm , normal S1 , S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops. Thepatient had bilateral anterior chest wall pain to mild palpationat the T3 level. Overlying the skin there was no erythema orwarmth. However , there was a fluctuant mass underneath the skinsurface. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultationbilaterally , but she had shallow respirations due to pain on deepbreaths. Her abdominal exam was soft and nontender. Examinationof her extremities revealed multiple excoriations that wereclean , dry , and intact. Although the patient was somnolent attimes and difficult to arouse , she was alert and oriented x3 andher neurologic exam was nonfocal. It appears that the patient'sexcessive tiredness and excessive sleeping is her baselinebehavior. When the patient needed to be awake and oriented toperform certain tasks , such as getting an MRI , she was able to doso. Moreover , when she was witnessed interacting with her son ,she was more alert.CODE STATUS: Full code.CONSULTS:1. Infectious disease ( Mickey Vesley , Infectious Disease fellow ).2.

Congestive heart failure.2. Hypertension.3. Hypothyroidism.4. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.5. Polymyalgia rheumatica.6. Diabetic retinopathy.7. Urinary tract infection.8. Adrenal insufficiency.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old femalewith a history of polymyalgia rheumatica for which she takessteroids and has developed adrenal insufficiency. She presentedto the emergency room with shortness of breath , wheezing , and amaculopapular rash after receiving the pneumovax shot. Shereceived this shot upon discharge from admission to the Baybell Lolic Hospital for syncope and dehydration. The treatment therewas IV fluids in short course and increase in her steroids. Inthe emergency room , she was treated with steroids , Benadryl , andPepcid.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. Immunology: The patient was found to have anaphylacticreaction to the Pneumovax shot that she received. Hersymptoms resolved by hospital day #1 after receiving IV Benadrylaround the clock , Pepcid , and an increased dose in her Hydrocortto 100 mg IV q.6h. The steroids were started on a taper and onthe night of the first admission , the patient was noted to have increasedshortness of breath andoxygen requirements. She was treated with oxygen and increasedsteroids again for presumed reexacerbation of anaphylaxis.2. Pulmonary: The episode of wheezing that she had on the firstday of admission could also be partly explained by fluidoverload. By hospital day #2 , she had developed crackles andjugular venous distention. She has a history of diastolic heartdysfunction , and diuresis was initiated. Despite receiving 3doses of IV Lasix , she had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on thesecond night of hospitalization. A chest x-ray was obtained atthat time which was consistent with pulmonary edema. She wasstabilized with additional Lasix and 100% nonrebreather mask , andnitroglycerin. Her blood pressure was 200 systolic at that time.The plan for continued diuresis was interrupted on hospital day#3 when she became hypotensive and febrile with a UA consistent with infection.She was started on Levo for presumed urosepsis.On hospital day #4 , diuresis was resumed as her blood pressurestabilized around 110 , and she still had a 5-6L oxygen requirement. Thepatient reports her dry weight is 140 to 143 lbs. Herprimary care doctor suspects it more like 149 lbs. She iscurrently receiving diuresis to wean oxygen requirement and isdown to 1 L per nasal cannula. Her goal fluid status is tonegative 1 L per day , and she continues to receive Lasix IV tomeet that goal.She was also restarted on p.o. Lasix 30 mg p.o. daily. Therewas some concern about aspiration by the nursing staff. Sheimmediately had trouble with swallowing liquids and Speech andSwallow was consulted. The patient failed the bedside swallowexam and so a video swallow was obtained , which actually showedno evidence of aspiration , and so she was continued on a regulardiet. By the time of discharge she did not require any oxygen. She wouldintermittently desat to the high 80s , which would quickly resolve with deepbreathing or chest PT.3. Endocrinology. The patient has a history of PMR and adrenalinsufficiency , on 30 mg of Hydrocort daily at home. On theMay , 2005 , in the setting of urosepsis she was placed back on stressdose steroids which was then tapered back to her home dose throughout therest of her hospitalization. She has a history ofdiabetes type 2 requiring insulin inhouse or oral agents. Oralagents were held and insulin was given for glucose control , NPH30 units in the morning and 10 units in the evening seemed tocontrol the a.m. and p.m. sugars pretty well. Regular insulinwas added 6 units in the morning with breakfast with the morningNPH for 1 p.m. blood sugar control , as this was the highest bloodsugar daily. Obviously , this needs to be monitored and adjustedas needed as well the medicine staff is going to be following heras to whether she should resume the oral agents. She does onoccasion drop her blood sugar to 50 or 60 , which is usuallyasymptomatic.4. Renal: Her baseline creatinine was 1.0. Both her BUN andcreatinine were elevated with diuresis. Her creatinine needs tobe monitored closely and medications need to renally dosed.5. Infectious Disease: Her urine was positive for greater than100 , 000 group B hemolytic Streptococci and she was initiallystarted with Levaquin. It was switched to penicillin on January , 2005 , after the gram-positive organism was discovered and shewas switched back to Levaquin after the sensitivities came back ,and it was sensitive to Levaquin. The Levaquin is ideal becauseher coughing could also represent bronchitis. She has complainedof a cough since weeks before admission , which is now resolving.6. Disposition: The patient does not feel that she can care forherself at home and screening was placed to Er Medical Center , and that was accepted for the acute care centerfor Saturday , March , 2005.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is just to follow up withprimary care physician. She should also follow up with Dr.Wann from Pulmonary at the Reddis Hospital University Of Anappointment will be made for her. She should return to theemergency room if she experiences chest pain , further shortnessof breath , severe sweating , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , orother concerns.LABORATORY DATA: On discharge , glucose 116 , BUN 30 , creatinine1.3 , sodium 139 , potassium 3.4; please make a note that herpotassium requires repletion and should be monitored; chloride93 , CO2 33 , CK 34 , calcium 8.7 , magnesium 1.8 , troponin less thanassay.

HISTORY OF URINARY RETENTION SECONDARY TOBENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63 year old man witha history of hypertension and pipesmoking , who was admitted with a one month history of exertionaldizziness and diaphoresis. The patient had an ETT in September 1992where he went 6 minutes and 34 seconds on a standard Bruce to amaximum heart rate of 145 and a maximum blood pressure of 170/90.The patient stopped secondary to fatigue and did not have any chestpain. The EKG showed 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in II , III and F andV4-V6 , and was read as suggestive of coronary artery disease. Thepatient was put on Atenolol 500 mg q.d. two weeks prior toadmission. The patient was also diagnosed with hypertension atthis time. One day prior to admission , the patient had threeepisodes of exertional substernal chest tightness associated withlightheadedness , diaphoresis , and shortness of breath. Eachepisode lasted 20-40 minutes and resolved with rest. The finalepisode being on the day of admission at 9 A.M. There was nonausea and vomiting. The patient denies paroxysmal nocturnaldyspnea and leg edema. The patient was treated in the EmergencyRoom with Aspirin , Nitro Paste and oxygen , and sent to the floorfor further evaluation and treatment of his unstable angina. PASTMEDICAL HISTORY: Includes a history of a hiatal hernia , history ofrecurrent esophagitis , with endoscopy in January 1991 which wasnegative for Barrett's esophagus. The patient also had a historyof lower GI bleeding in July of 1991 , and a colonoscopy showeddiverticulosis. The patient had a history of urinary retentionsecondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy. He also has a historyof urethral calculi and is status post an appendectomy. Thepatient has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Include Atenolol 50 p.o. q.d. and Zantac 150 b.i.d. The patient isa long time pipe smoker , and he denies alcohol use. FAMILYHISTORY: Is notable for a father who died of a myocardialinfarction in 1962.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , he was a 63 year old male in noacute distress with a temperature of 98.2 ,blood pressure 110/60 , pulse 64 , and respiratory rate of 18. Hispupils were equal , round , and reactive to light. The extraocularmovements were intact. His oropharynx was clear. He had nojugular venous distention. He had 2+ carotid pulses withoutbruits. His lungs were clear. His heart was a regular rate andrhythm , S1 and S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. His abdomenwas soft , nontender , with positive bowel sounds , and nohepatosplenomegaly. Extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , oredema. His neurological exam was nonfocal. The rectal exam wasguaiac negative in the Emergency Room.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 141 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 107 ,CO2 26 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose148. The admission CK was 70. He had normal liver function tests.His LDH was 144 , cholesterol 171 , triglycerides 257 , hematocrit45.5 , platelets 198 , white blood count 7.42 with a normaldifferential. PT 12.4 , PTT 27.4. His chest x-ray showed clearlungs , and the EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 57 with an axis of-4 degrees. There were T-waves in aVF , T-wave inversion in leadIII. There was no change from an EKG in October 1992.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor for ruleout myocardial infarction and treatment of hisunstable angina. On the floor , the patient experienced chest painand an EKG showed ST elevation in the inferior leads. As thisindicated that the patient was having an acute inferior myocardialinfarction , the patient was taken to an emergent catheterization asPTCA was contraindicated because of his history of diverticulosiswith lower GI bleeding. At catheterization , the patient was notedto have a 90% RCA lesion and a 90% LAD lesion. The RCA lesion wassuccessfully dilated , and the patient was admitted to the CCU for postmyocardial infarction care. His post MI course was complicated on 5/10/92 by400 cc of coffeeground emesis. The patient's hematocrit fell from40 to 35 , but was then stable. His Heparin and Aspirin were held ,and the patient was given Omeprazole and antacids. The patientalso had an episode of left arm pain without any significant EKGchanges. As well , the patient experienced an episode ofhypotension with the blood pressure falling to the 70's following adose of Metoprolol 5 mg IV. The patient was treated with IV fluidsand was then stable. On 2/15/92 , an echocardiogram was notable forleft atrial size of 4.0 , inferior and posterior left ventricular moderatehypokinesis but good overall LV systolic function. Therewas 1+ TR , 1+ AI , and 1+ MR as well. On 2/15/92 , the patient wastransferred to the floor where he was noted to have a low gradefever of 100.2. A subclavian catheter was removed and cultured ,and several blood cultures were sent. The catheter tip culturegrew coagulase negative Staph but his blood cultures were negative.This was felt to represent a contaminant and not requiring IVtreatment. The patient thereafter showed no signs of infection andwas afebrile. On the evening of 10/16/92 , the patient experiencedtwo episodes of sharp left sternal chest pain , one lasting fiveminutes and the other three minutes , though unfortunately no EKGwas done at the time. The following day , the patient wasambulating without chest pain. There were no further episodes ofchest pain. The patient was begun on low dose Inderal 5 mg t.i.d.On the second , the patient had an ETT with a modified Bruceprotocol which was stopped at 8 minutes secondary to fatigue andshortness of breath , and a maximum heart rate of 120 , and bloodpressure of 140/70. There were 1 mm ST depressions in leads I , L ,anda V2-V6 which persisted during recovery. The patient waspresented with the option of remaining in the house with a repeatcatheterization with probable angioplasty of his LAD lesion thefollowing Monday ( 3/15/92 ) or recovering at home with readmissionsin one to two weeks for a repeat catheterization withPTCA. The patient and his wife decided to opt for recovery athome , and the patient was discharged on 6/8/92.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated Aspirin oneq.d. , Omeprazole 20 b.i.d. , Inderal 5 t.i.d. ,sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and Ativan 0.5 to 1 mg q6-8 hoursp.r.n.

He reported two tablespoons ofbright red blood when coughed up , but he did not have apersistent cough. No shortness of breath. No fevers , chills ,night sweats or other symptoms.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Morbid obesity , DVTs , PEs , hypertension ,total hip replacement and status post hernia repair.ALLERGIES: Versed.EXAM ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97 , respirations 22 , bloodpressure 114/78 , oxygen 97 on room air. General: He is obese ,talkative , walking around. Had moist mucous membranes. Unableto assess JVP due to size. Lungs: Clear. Heart: Regularwithout murmurs. S1 and S2 were normal. Abdomen: Obese ,nontender , and nondistended and soft. Extremities: Show chronicvenostasis changes without evidence of cyanosis , open wound andsome edema was present. EKG on admission showed normal sinusrhythm at 74 beats per minute with no significant ST-T changes.Chest x-ray that he brought from an outside hospital showed righthilar prominence with question of a mass. Chest x-ray in theemergency room at the Dwindshutzuc Memorial Hospital showed noacute process and severe pulmonary congestion.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 144 , potassium 4.1 ,chloride 102 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose104 , white blood cell 3.7 , hematocrit 54 , platelets 188 , INR 2.1 ,PTT 33. An echo in September 2005 showed mild LVH and ejectionfraction of 55%-60% , increased RV , right systolic function mildlyreduced and mild RAE and LAE.HOSPITAL COURSE: In the emergency room , the patient receivedvitamin K 6 mg x1 to reverse his Coumadin in the setting ofhemoptysis.1. Pulmonary: The source of his hemoptysis was initiallyunclear. His sputum looked only blood tinged on the admissionexam , but the patient reported bright red blood prior toadmission. His chest x-ray from the outside hospital looked likea right hilar prominence , which was read as a possible mass , buta repeat study done in the emergency room at the Crantlupethes Tyli Medical Center showedonly pulmonary congestion and no mass or acute process. He hasvery minimal history of smoking cigarettes in the past. He wastoo large to fit into a CAT scan machine , so he underwent a V/Qscan , which demonstrated low probability for pulmonary embolus.The pulmonary service was consulted and their impression was thathis hemoptysis was likely secondary to severe pulmonaryhypertension but not a mass or infection. They opted not toperform a bronchoscopy and recommended starting sildenafil forpulmonary hypertension. The Gini Shawn Health , the PulmonaryHypertension Service was then consulted. They did not recommendthe sildenafil so that was actually not started. They didrecommend starting torsemide 80 b.i.d. for better diuresis andthis was initiated and resulted in good urine output. His homedose of diuretic was 80 mg of Lasix daily. Upon discharge , hewas sent home on 80 mg of Lasix twice a day with recommendationsto have his blood drawn , to measure electrolytes within a week ,and follow up with his PCP as soon as possible. The Gentm. Cathege Charleba Medical Hospitalrecommended an outpatient cath and he was instructed to follow upwith them. He also reports a history of sleep apnea and BiPAPuse at home , although he admits that he does not use the BiPAPmachine. He was set up with BiPAP and nighttime oxygen inhouseand he was continued on Coumadin for his history of pulmonaryemboli. His Coumadin was held initially on admission in thesetting of hemoptysis , but it was restarted after the V/Q scanwas low probability. He was also placed on a heparin drip whilethe Coumadin was not therapeutic. He was discharged on 12 mg ofCoumadin daily.2. Cardiovascular and hypertension: He was continued on hishome meds.3. Infectious disease: He did develop bilateral lower extremityerythema and tenderness on 1/14/05 and he was started on IVAncef 2 g q.8 h. for presumed cellulitis. This was changed toKeflex upon discharge.4. Gout: He continued on his home meds without incident.DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to have hislytes drawn within a week by the PCP , VNA , or lab center. He wasinstructed to have his INR measured on Monday or Tuesday and forthe results to be sent to his PCP and/or the Coumadin Clinic. Hewas instructed to use oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula for 15hours overnight and to use the BiPAP machine and elevate his legswhile not walking or standing and to wear compression stockings.ALLERGIES: Midazolam.FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENT: He has an appointment with Dr. Dzuro ,633-000-5523 on 7/11/05 at 9:30 a.m.eScription document: 7-2829527 ISSten TelDictated By: OBERER , FLORENCIOAttending: SENESE , DIEGODictation ID 6699078D: 11/14/05T: 7/6/05

CAD.2. Hypertension.3. Congestive heart failure.4. Diabetes.5. Hypercholesterolemia.6. Peripheral vascular disease.7. Smoking history.8. History of alcohol abuse.9. History of seizure disorder.10. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Mauras is a 72-year-old man withhistory of CAD status post CABG , PCI with history of stableangina , type 2 diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , formersmoking history and also history of seizure disorder withcataracts and recently discharged after an admission for atrialfibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He had occasionalanginal symptoms prior to discharge. He took about twonitroglycerins per week. Over the past week , he had escalatingchest pain requiring one nitroglycerin per day. The pain wasrelieved by rest and nitroglycerin. One week prior to admission ,his digoxin was stopped and his amiodarone was decreased. HisPlavix was stopped and his Coumadin was held. On the morning ofadmission , he had chest pain. He had two nitroglycerins andrested but the pain persisted. He was taken to the ED. In theED , he received Lopressor , Enalapril , Lovenox treatment dose anda Plavix load.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes CAD , hypertension , CHF , diabetes ,hypercholesterolemia , peripheral vascular disease and pastsmoking history.ALLERGIES: To penicillin.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for past alcohol and smokinghistory. He quit alcohol 25 years ago.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Significant for afebrile , heart rate 45and blood pressure 95/50. He had a left surgical pupil , left eyeptosis at baseline. His heart had no murmurs , rubs or gallops.His lungs were clear. His abdomen was soft , nontender andnondistended. He had bilateral femoral bruits , 2+ distal pulses.No pronator drift.LABS: Significant for hematocrit baseline at 30 to 32 , whitecount of 13. His troponin peaked at 6.4.EKG showed ST depressions in V3 through V6 that were new.Echocardiogram on 3/23/05 showed an EF of 25 to 30% with septalakinesis lateral and posterior hypokinesis and mild tricuspidregurgitation.Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course for this 72-year-old man withnon-ST-elevation MI.1. Cardiovascular: A catheterization on hospital day 1 showedfour-vessel disease. No intervention was taken at that point , asit was unclear which region was the culprit. Afterwards , he wasin hypotensive respiratory distress , likely secondary to flashpulmonary edema. He received Lasix and morphine and he wasstarted on a nitro drip with improvement in symptoms. He wasfound to have flash pulmonary edema and in atrial fibrillationwith rapid ventricular response. He was taken back to thecatheterization lab and given four stents to his saphenous veingraft , OM1 with good resolution of his symptoms and he went tothe CCU afterwards. On hospital day 3 , he was transferred to thefloor and was given an amiodarone load given his ejectionfraction and increased ectopy on telemetry. His troponin hadbeen trended down to the 0.2s by discharge. His beta-blocker andACE inhibitor were titrated to heart rate and blood pressure.Prior to anticipated discharge , he re-developed flash pulmonaryedema secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricularresponse. Electrophysiology consult evaluated him and based onhis prior ejection fraction symptoms , it was decided to place adual-chamber pacemaker with AICD. He has had no respiratoryevents since that placement. He has remained in atrialfibrillation and was re-loaded with digoxin. He was started onhis Coumadin two days prior to discharge and was not yettherapeutic. His repeat echo did show an EF of 55%. This wasafter the pacemaker was placed.2. Renal: He has chronic renal insufficiency. He was givenMucomyst precath with good effect. His creatinine on dischargewas 1.1 and he was making urine.3. GU: He has had some symptoms of urinary retention withdifficult-to-place Foley. He was started on Flomax with goodeffect. His prostate was not overtly large on exam. His PSA waswithin normal limits.4. Endocrine: He is a type 2 diabetic. His home dose ofmetformin was held. He was continued on Lantus with slidingscale insulin.5. Hematology: His hematocrit was transiently down to 24. Whentransferred out of the CCU , he was given three units of packedred blood cells given his history of CAD. Since this , hishematocrit has been stable in the 30-to-32 range. An abdominalCT did not show any evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. His groinhad only a very small hematoma. His stool guaiac was only tracepositive.DISPOSITION: He was discharged home in stable condition with VNAservices. He will follow up with his PCP on 10/19/05 , with Dr.Wicinsky on 1/14/05 , and he should have his INR checked on3/5/05 or 1/14/05 and Coumadin adjusted accordingly.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: His physical exam ondischarge was largely unchanged , afebrile and hemodynamicallystable. He had now a pacemaker placed over the left chest.Incision looked clean , slightly tender to palpation. He had nomurmurs or rubs , no pedal edema. His chest was clear.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1.

Discharge from the wound was cultured and grew out Ecoli andEnterobacter , sensitive to cipro. Abx were switched to cipro which wouldprovide coverage for the gram negatives growing from her wound and alsocover her cellulitis. She will complete a total abx course of 12 days( additional 5 days of cipro ). There was an initial concern for DVT butLENIS were negative. Zinc and Vit C were added to her regimen. She willalso need Wound changes with NS wet to dry BID. The ulcer is most likelydue to poor wound healing in the setting of chronic venous stasis. It wasalso noted that she had very weak LE pulse so vascualar surgery wasconsulted. She was found to have + peripheral pulses by doppler , andfollow up with vascular surgery was set up for her. She will also getumaboots and ABI at her followup.***2 ) bradycardia: to 30's during sleep. Pt came in on atenolol which wediscontinued , esecially in the setting of CRI.

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 5/20/1998 Report Status: SignedDischarge Date: 11/26/1998CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest and epigastric pain.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old woman whois having a significant amount of GIdistress with belching and gas over several months to years whopresents with three hours of upper abdominal and chest discomfortwhich she described after a fall day of volunteering and doing herexercise. Actually she was sitting down to eat and then developedthis symptom that lasted for about three hours. The patient didnot that she has run out of her Atenolol for more than three daysprior to admission and came to the Emergency Room when her pain didnot resolve after taking some Tums and some water. The patientdenies any previous history of angina. She came into the EmergencyRoom and had a blood pressure of 190/97 with a normal EKG. Thepatient was given 5 mg of Lopressor and started back on herAtenolol with decrease of her heart rate and blood pressure andresolution of her symptoms.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Diabetes.2. Hypertension.3. Hypercholesteremia.ALLERGIES: Streptomycin.MEDICATIONS:1. Lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.2. Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.3. Aspirin 325 mg q d.4. Niacin 250 mg b.i.d.5. Colace.6. Multivitamin.7. NPH insulin 20 units q a.m.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a senior's home. She doesnot smoke or drink alcohol.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: She was afebrile. Bloodpressure 150/90 , heart rate 84. O2saturation was 94-97% on room air. GENERAL: The patient was apleasant obese woman in no acute distress , belching during herhistory. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation except forsome initial left basilar crackles , which have cleared. HEART:Regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs , gallops or rubs.ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender. RECTAL: Heme negative , perexamination in the Emergency Room. EXTREMITIES: She did have somebilateral trace edema. NEUROLOGIC: Non-focal.DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: SMA-7 was significant for a glucose 236. CPKwas 74 , troponin 0.04. CBC and coags werenormal. Chest x-ray did show a top normal cardiac silhouette withmild evidence of CHF. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no acuteST or T wave changes.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Short Stay Unit.She was put on cardiac telemetry and was ruledout for myocardial infarction with serial CPKs and EKGs. She hadno further episodes of her discomfort but did have continuedbelching. On further discussion with the patient , she was actuallya relatively active woman who did not have any anginal symptoms inthe past and never described any shortness of breath , PND ororthopnea. The plan was made to get an echocardiogram and do anadenosine stress test. Her adenosine stress test was negative forchest pain or EKG changes and her MIBI was negative for fixedreversible defects. She therefore was felt to be negative forischemia. However , on her MIBI and her echocardiogram she did havea mildly decreased LV function of 40-45% , of unknown significanceand unknown etiology. It was felt that this could be furtherworked up for other causes , including sending out for TSH , SPEP ,UPEP , and iron studies as an outpatient , as the patient was anxiousto leave the hospital. This could be done in clinic by her primarycare physician.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on her admissionmedications with the addition of Axid 150 mg p.o.b.i.d. and simethicone 80 q.i.d. p.r.n. for her gas. The patientwill discuss her GI symptoms with her primary care physician andwould benefit from further workup as an outpatient.

Her symptoms first developed onThursday. She had checked her BS and BP at that time and they were300 and 150 systolic. Her symptoms resolved but returned on SundayPTA and persisted throughout the day so Monday she went tosee her PCP. At the PCPs office her BP was noted to be 212 systolicand she was sent to the ED for evaluation. Of note , on route to thePCP office she had a fleeting episode of chest "cramping" whichwas unlike her previous angina or MI pain. ---In the ED: The patient received labetolol 10mg IV X2 , labetolol 400mgpo X1 , nitropaste 3". Her BP remained above 200 despite thesemedications and then she received hydralazine 10mg IV X1 whichresulted in dropping her BP to 150 systolic.---PMH: see list.---Meds at Home: Asa 81 , Lasix 40 , Plavix 75 , Nexium 20 , Valsartan160 , labetolol 400 bid , Imdur 60 , Spironolactone 12.5 QOD , Lipitor80 , Levoxyl 112 , Oxycodone prn , lantus 70 qhs , Humalog 18q breakfast ,20q supper , colace 100 tid prn , NTG SLprn.---ALL: amox-diarrhea , codeine-nausea , Lisinopril-cough , Nuts &strawberries--anaphylaxis.---PE on Admit: VS: T 96.3 , HR 84 , BP 128/64 , RR 20 , O2 97% on 2LGEN: NAD , pale HEENT: PERRLA , anictericNECK: no JVD or LADPULM: CTA CV: RRR , +SEM at RUSB Abd: Soft , NT ,ND Ext: no c/c/e Neuro: no focal deficits---CXR: stable cardiomegaly ECHO 1/28 EF 60-65% , noRWMA Cath 2/25 pLAD discrete 45% lesion , mid LCxdiscrete 65% lesion , pRCA discrete 35% lesion Head CT: no acuteintracranial process---HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for management ofhypertensive urgency.---CV: The cause of her high BP is not clear. There is no indication ofmed non-compliance. Her PCP reports labile BPs are a problem for her.Her BP was controlled after she arrived to the floor. Shewas resumed on her home dose of Labetolol. There was discussion ofincreasing her labetolol dose but this ended up not being necessary.In fact she was symptomatic with a BP of 120 in terms offeeling lightheaded. Therefore her hold parameters were increased to130 systolic. In addition she had occasional ectopic apical heartbeats which resulted in early QRS complex and occasionalslight pauses <2sec. No major events on telemetry. Her heart rate wasrelatively slow around 50-55 much of the time. Her EKG did showslight ( 1mm ) ST segment depressions in antero-lateral leads and herCKMB was elevated on admission. She ruled out for MI with three setsof neg troponins. She may have had slight demand ischemia in settingof hypertension. Her CKMB was normal on day of discharge. Her troponinswere always negative. She had no s/s of CHF. She was monitored ontelemetry with no major events.---RENAL: The patient is a diabetic and in addition reports a recenthistory of contrast induced nephropathy. She had proteinuria onadmission which is slighly higher than usual ( 3+ compared to 2+ ) buther creatinine was improved from baseline to 1.6 ( 1.8-2.2 ). A renalultrasound showed normal kidneys with no hydronephrosis. UPEP , SPEPand spot urine/protein were ordered. Her spot urine protein was 222. Herproteinuria in a chronic problem. UPEP/SPEP need to be followed up asoutpt but suspicion for malignancy is very low.---ENDO: The pt has history of DM and takes Lantus and Humolog at home.She missed her lantus dose the night of admission and subsequent amBS was high. She received NPH to cover her for the HD#1 and thenshe resumed Lantus that evening. She also received her home humulogand a sliding scale. She received a carb controlled diet. Her TSH was1.2 on home Levoxyl.---FEN: Her lytes were repleted as needed.---GI: Her renal ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder and aslightly distended CBD. Bili T and D were added and are normal. She hadno abd pain or tenderness so her gallbladder sludge is not likely torepresent a pathology.---ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Monitor your BP at home and call your PCP if >180.2. Monitor Fingersticks at home three times a day ( before each meal ) andrecord in a note book to bring to PCP appointment3.

Patient has multiple risk factors including a historyof inferior myocardial infarction , smoking history , family history ,and age. She does not have diabetes mellitus or increasedcholesterol. In 1/24 , she had an inferior myocardial infarctionand had a catheterization in April of l988 showing 70% left anteriordescending , 50% right circumflex , and l00% right coronary arterylesion with an ejection fraction of 80%. In l988 , she had threevessel coronary artery bypass graft with a LIMA to her leftanterior descending and saphenous vein graft to her OMB2 and rightcoronary artery. The patient also has a history of peptic ulcerdisease diagnosed with melena in 3/10 and had anesophagogastroduodenoscopy showing antral gastritis. In 11/23 , shehad a colonoscopy that showed diverticula and she has a history ofchronic anemia with a hematocrit in the mid to high twenties and anMCV of 68. Patient was treated with H2 blockers and iron butstopped secondary to constipation. In 7/18 , the patient againpresented with orthostatic changes and shortness of breath withpain to her arm similar to her previous myocardial infarction pain.Her hematocrit at that time was 20.8. She was transfused threeunits of packed red blood cells and given Lasix and H2 blockers.She ruled out for myocardial infarction and had a catheterizationin 7/18 that showed patent LIMA to her left anterior descending ,her left anterior descending native vessel was free of disease , anda 50% long proximal circumflex lesion as well as a proximal OM2lesion that was narrowed to 70% at its origin. Anesophagogastroduodenoscopy at that time was negative and thepatient was discharged home for colonoscopy with Small BowelFollow-Through that was never done. In the interval period priorto admission , the patient was in her usual state of fair healthwhen she had an hour of chest pain in the morning and thirtyminutes in the evening per week. She also noted several episodesat rest principally with increased anxiety and with confusion. Thepatient presented to GH with a thirty minute history ofsubsternal chest pressure that was not responsive to sublingualNitroglycerin and was associated with diaphoresis and mildshortness of breath. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant forcoronary artery disease as described above , peptic ulcer disease asabove , left neck basal carcinoma in l986 , chronic iron deficiencyanemia , history of biliary colic and hiatal hernia , history ofchronic vertigo , and history of a thyroid nodule in the past.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her blood pressure was l22/90 ,pulse of 90 , respiratory rate of l6 , andtemperature 98.2. HEENT: Unremarkable. LUNGS: Clear toauscultation. NECK: Supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly.CARDIOVASCULAR: Showed non-displaced point of maximal intensity ,regular rate and rhythm with a positive S4. There were no murmurs ,rubs , or gallops. She had 2+ carotid pulses without bruits.ABDOMEN: Showed active bowel sounds and was obese , soft , andnon-tender without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. EXTREMITIES:Showed 2+ femoral , radial , and dorsalis pedis pulses withoutbruits. She had no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. RECTAL: Showednormal tone without masses and was guaiac negative. NEUROLOGICAL:Grossly non-focal and within normal limits.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Of note , she had a hematocrit of 27.0 witha white count of 6.9 and an MCV of 63.Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with axis of 20 degrees ,intervals of 0.l6 , 0.08 , and 0.40 with a Q wave in III , and T waveinversions in III , V3 , and Vl-V4. These were all unchanged fromher previous EKG from 5/6HOSPITAL COURSE: Remarkable only for a rule out myocardialinfarction in which she had serial CK and EKGthat were completely within normal limits. Her CK were l54 , 482 ,and 592 with normal MB fractions most consistent with either a verysmall myocardial infarction or , more likely , CK leak from someother source. Patient had several episodes of atypical chest painafter being moved down to the floor and EKG were completely withinnormal limits without any evidence of acute changes. Patient wastransferred to the floor on September and her significant laboratorydata included a white blood cell count of 5.89 , hematocrit 34 ,platelets 458 , and MCV of 68. Calcium was 9.4 , magnesium 2.6 ,sodium l37 , potassium 4.6 , chloride l03 , bicarbonate 22 , BUN l8 ,creatinine l.l , and glucose 9l. Serial CK were l54 , 482 , 592 , 553 ,464 , and 3l2 , with MB fractions all less than l0. Her iron was l4and her TIBC was 479 with a ferritin pending. Urinalysis showed20-30 white blood cells with 3+ bacteria and a urine culture showedgreater than l00 , 000 E. coli. This was treated with Bactrim. OnJuly , the patient had no more episodes of chest pain and had anexercise stress test on which he went nine minutes on a modifiedBruce protocol stopping secondary to fatigue. Her peak heart ratewas 95 , blood pressure l75/75 without chest pain , and only unifocalpremature ventricular contractions with her exercise. She hadnon-specific ST and T wave changes only without evidence forischemia. This was thought to be inconsistent with ongoingischemia and the patient was discharged to home. Of note , thepatient is not an AKH patient and has no primary doctor.Therefore , I am going to assume her care as an out-patient in NIDA TION HOSPITAL .Pending laboratory data includes ferritin level.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Exercise tolerance test as above andblood products received were none.DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Aspirin , ECASA , 80 mgp.o. q.d. 2 ) Bactrim one tablet double-strengthp.o. b.i.d. times seven days. 3 ) Sublingual Nitroglycerin one q.5minutes with chest pain as directed. 4 ) Metoprolol 75 mg p.o.t.i.d. 5 ) Iron Sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.i.d. 6 ) Pepcid 20 mg p.o.b.i.d. The patient will be followed in my clinic in the nextavailable and I have scheduled her for an Upper Series With SmallBowel Follow-Through to follow-up on her gastrointestinal bleeding.I started her on Iron Sulfate and have encouraged her to make surethat she takes this in order to increase her hematocrit.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE STATUS POST CORONARYARTERY BYPASS GRAFT , URINARY TRACT INFECTION ,GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED , AND IRON DEFICIENCYANEMIA.MR381/9093DREW S.

She wasbrought in to BMC today , given aspirin , sublingual Nitroglycerinand transferred to the Montexo Medical Center for furtherevaluation. In the Emergency Room , her systolic blood pressure is130. She was tachycardic , and she was given IV Nitroglycerin. Thepatient then became hypotensive due to overaggressiveNitroglycerin. The patient received Inderal for tachycardia. Notirofiban was given given her history of cerebrovascular accident.Her chest burning was not resolved with IV Nitroglycerin. She wasgiven Morphine sulfate x 2 mg , Inderal and an esmolol drip.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypothyroidism. 2. Diabetes mellitus.3. Hypertension. 4. Borderline personalitydisorder. 5.

She went tocatheterization and was found to have 100% left anterior descendingwith right to left collaterals and poor distal flow as well as a90% mid and 90% distal right coronary artery with significantvessel tortuosity. The left anterior descending was percutaneoustransluminal coronary angioplastied with question of distaldissection which required stent placement. It led to initial goodresult. A wire was passed through the stent , but no balloon couldbe passed. There was no proximal stent placed due to poor outflow.The plan was to return to Catheterization Laboratory to attemptright coronary artery stenting. However , she subsequently spiked atemperature to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. She was pan cultured andher sheaths were removed. No antibiotics were started at thattime. Her urine subsequently grew greater than 100 , 000 E. coli ,and she was started on levofloxacin with plan for a repeatcatheterization once afebrile x 24 hours.

She had a DVT about 10years ago in the left lower extremity. She was coumadinized at thattime for 3 months. In September of 1994 she had an abdominal herniarepair and had recurrent DVT by LENIs but was not treated. On 8/5she presented again with a left lower extremity pain and was foundto have an acute and chronic deep venous thrombosis and wasanticoagulated with Heparin and changed to Coumadin at home. Thepatient was poorly compliant with her Coumadin. In October of 1995she was too depressed to take her Coumadin. Her INR dropped. Shehad sharp chest pain like gas over her precordium. The pain clearedspontaneously. Eventually she called her REQUEST MEDICAL CENTER primary doctor , Dr.Babbish complaining of this pain and was admitted to the Misent Tlhealtmigo Medical Center for rule out MI and rule out PE. VQ scan at thattime was low probability. She was discharged on Coumadin 5mg a dayand Lasix 20mg a day for lower extremity edema. A dobutamine MIBIwas also performed and was negative. On 1/10 she came to the EWcomplaining of chest pressure and left lower extremity swelling.She reported that since 7/25 she started having right anteriorchest pain with chest wall pain which was increased with deepventilation , no cough. She did have some increased shortness ofbreath and she reported increased swelling and pain of the leftlower extremity and overall was feeling poorly.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Is as above and also includes obesity andosteoarthritis of the knees.MEDICATIONS: Coumadin , Lasix , Zoloft.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was obese black female. Temperature 98.1 ,heart rate 72 , blood pressure 138/80.Respiration is 20. 02 saturation on 4 liters was 96%. HEENT:Unremarkable other than obesity and a sick sounding voice. Chest:Clear to auscultation. Cardiac Exam: Regular rate and rhythm with aII/VI systolic murmur over the left sternal border , no S3 , no S4.Abdomen: Obese , soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: Left lower extremitywas tender in the calf but not warm , no erythematous. She did havetrace edema. Her pulses distally were 2+ on both sides.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable for a hematocrit of 47 , a whitecount of 5.2 , platelets of 236 , normalSMA7 , a PT of 13.9 and INR of 1.3 , a PTT of 31.5. Chest x-rayshowed no acute infiltrate. Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at78 with an axis of 58 , normal intervals , Q in III , and F in I ,upright Ts in III , no RVH , no strain compared with prior EKGs. ABGon room air was pH of 7.39 , PC02 of 47 and P02 of 57 , 88%saturation. LENIs showed no right DVT , a left greater saphenousvein superficial venous thrombosis , no change compared with 10/16/95.A VQ scan was low probability and when compared to the study ofOctober 1995 was entirely unchanged.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted , heparinized and begun onCoumadin with a goal PTT of 60-80 and INR of 2-3.Her calf pain was felt secondary to superficial thrombophlebitisand post phlebitic syndrome. Interventional Radiology was consultedto obtain a PA gram , however they felt that the risk of theprocedure outweighed the benefits given that her VQ scan wasentirely unchanged from prior. Her hypoxia seemed related more toher sleep apnea. She was started on CPAP , which she toleratedrather poorly , however was encouraged to continue to use it givenher potential long-term benefits. She had an 02 saturation on roomair in the high 80s to low 90s , which improved when she used theCPAP. There was an initial thought that there may be cellulitis inthe left lower extremity , however this was born out clinically andshe was initially started on I.V. oxacillin in the Emergency Roombut this was stopped after one day. Of note , her chest pain seemedto be quite esophageal or reflux related and she was started onAxid with remarkable decrease in her symptoms. Sputum culture wasobtained and showed oral flora. She had no infiltrate on chestx-ray and was not treated for bronchitis either.DISPOSITION: She was therefore discharged in stable condition tofollow up with Dr. Lamp in Clinic as well as the SleepStudy Lab recommended that she follow up with ENT to see if anysurgical options were available to her in correcting her sleepapnea. MEDICATIONS: Lasix 20mg p.o. q day , Coumadin 5mg p.o.q.h.s. , Zoloft 50mg p.o. q day , Axid 150mg p.o. b.i.d. She willfollow up with Dr. Derek Hodgens in Clinic and in the ENT Clinic 1-2weeks after discharge. She will also follow up in Coumadin Clinictwo days after discharge to have her INR checked in HENNABE HOSPITAL .Dictated By: WALLY Q. JOSTEN , M.D. JZ62Attending: HONG R.

One ventricular wire was placed. The patient cameoff cardiopulmonary bypass on one of Levophed.COMPLICATIONS:None.After the operation , the patient was transferred in stablecondition to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Upon arrival tothe Cardiac Intensive Care Unit , he was noted to have lowhematocrit and was given 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Afterobtaining another hematocrit level once this transfusion toplace , his hematocrit was found to be increasing appropriately.He was transferred to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit on postoperativeday #1. While on the Cardiac Step-Down Unit , his course wascomplicated by the following:1. On postoperative day #4 , it was noted that the Ms. Didonnahad some erythema on the superior portion of his mediastinalincision that was also tender to palpation. As a precautionarystep , the patient was started on vancomycin , levofloxacin , andFlagyl. Cardiac Surgical Team elected to keep Mr. Kneser in thehospital while his mediastinal incision was observed. Over thenext several days , Mr. Schehr 's erythema had decreased and therewas no noted discharge from the incision. It was felt that therewas no evidence of mediastinal as Mr. Pappalardo remained afebrileand did not have leukocytosis.

Other diagnoses includeleft bundle branch block , paresthesias in the fingers , benignprostatic hypertrophy , prostatic adenocarcinoma , Gleason's score2/4 , C5-C6 and C6-C7 disk disease , status post left nephrectomyfor renal cell carcinoma , hyperplastic polyps in 1993 and alsostatus post AICD and dual chamber pacer.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 73-year-old malewell known to the CHF Service with long-standing New York HeartAssociation class 3B idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presentingwith shortness of breath and increasing orthopnea over the lastnight prior to admission from 8 to 9 p.m. The patient first wentto An Medical Center ER then left AMA without further treatment afterwaiting four hours. He reports increasing cough with whitesputum since 5/8 , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea especiallyover the last three days. Also there is a questionable increasein abdominal distention. The patient had been admitted fivetimes in the last six months with the last admission also forworsening dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and cough in which henotably had a TEE-guided cardioversion and diuresis. He wasdischarged on creatinine of 1.7. The patient freely admits thathe has had dietary indiscretion over the last two months ,claiming that he has been "eating like a horse" with meat andheavy sauces on pasta. The patient denies chest pain , fevers ,sick contacts , chills , weight gain or nausea.ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to erythromycin andpenicillin , which causes a rash. He also describes an allergy tocontrast.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was alert and oriented and inno acute distress with blood pressure of 82/62 , heart rate of 80beats per minute. His HEENT exam was unremarkable. Carotidupstrokes were brisk without bruits. There were no thyromegalyand his chest exam was clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam did demonstrate JVP of about 18 cm and also regularrate and rhythm with an S1 , S2 as well as an S3 and 1/6holosystolic murmur at the apex. The abdominal exam was notablefor an enlarged abdomen , but nondistended and without pulsatilepalpable liver edge. There was no tenderness to palpation. Theextremities were warm and with 1+ distal pulses and only traceedema.LABORATORY DATA: On admission were notable for BUN of 45 ,creatinine of 1.6 , K of 4.3 and sodium of 136. The INR was 1.3.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular. The patient was in volume overload and hisARB and Aldactone were held. Aggressive diuresis was undertakenfor most of this stay including an IV Lasix drip , which was laterweaned to a torsemide IV b.i.d. which was later changed to p.o.b.i.d. for a questionable reaction to the IV formation in theform of itchiness. He was also put on Zaroxolyn throughout thestay and he was started on dopamine drip , which was laterdiscontinued on 7/20/05 for long runs of NSVT that he hadpossibly secondary to sensitivity to the dopamine. However ,dobutamine was started on 2/11/05 and this dosage was increasedgradually over 8/1/05 to 1/19/05 to rate about 3 mcg/kg andthe patient tolerated this dosage fairly well. In addition ,electrolytes were repleted throughout the stay and the patientunderwent a workup for an LVAD placement including PFTs ,peripheral and carotid Dopplers and an abdominal ultrasound. He was shown tohave significant aortic vascular disease which was felt to represent acontra-indication for LVAD. Discussion ongoing with the patient during hisstay revealed that he would prefer not to have the LVADeven if he were eligible. He understood that he was not likely to live longwith the severity of his heart failure. The decision was later made to sendthe patient home with a Hickman catheter placed on 11/6/05 , so that he couldreceive home dobutamine. In terms of ischemia , the first set ofenzymes were flat and ischemia was judged not to be an activeissue. There were no changes on EKG. In terms of rhythm , thepatient does have history of prior AFib , however , he has remainedin normal sinus rhythm , status post cardioversion. He has hadasymptomatic runs of NSVT on the dopamine and less so on thedobutamine as mentioned above. Currently he was paced with anAICD. We kept the patient on amiodarone and digoxin as well ason tele.2. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renalinsufficiency and is status post left nephrectomy. We monitoredthe patient's BUN and creatinine while diuresing and although ,the patient did have an increased BUN to about 70 , diuretictreatment was continued as a primary goal.3. Endo. The patient has diabetes and we held oral glycemics ,putting him on regular insulin sliding scale and NPH doses. Alsothe patient had low TSH. This is probably due to subclinicalhypothyroidism or sick euthyroid.4. Heme. The patient is on Coumadin as an outpatient and wetitrated his INR to a goal of 2-3. The patient did have somenosebleeds on 10/21 and his Coumadin was temporarily held , butrestarted again for this goal of 2-3 later. The INR goal wasdecreased less than 1.5 where the placement of Hickman catheterwith the plan to restart the Coumadin after placement.5. Prostate. The patient does have a history of prostateadenocarcinoma , Gleason 2/5 on biopsy in 2004. This has beendiscussed with the patient by his urologist and the patient hasrefused surgery now with an increased PSA , however , we didconsult a Urology while the patient was here and it was deemedthat his prostate should not be a major prognostic considerationgiven the degree of his heart failure.Physical exam at discharge , in general the patient wascomfortable and in no apparent distress , sitting up and eatinghis food comfortably as far as the HEENT and neck exam his JVPwas about 10 cm. Cardiovascular exam showed occasional PVCs anda loud P2 and S3. In general unchanged from admission.Respiratorywise his lungs were clear to auscultation and breathsounds were equal bilaterally. His abdomen was somewhatdecreased in size from admission , soft and non-tensed.Extremities were warm without edema. Pulses were 1+ radial anddorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally as with admission he did havesome wasted lower extremities.DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with VNAServices. The plan is to follow his INR on Coumadin and tocontinue to monitor his heart for NSVT while on dobutamine. Alsoconsider an ARB or Aldactone. The patient has stable kidneyfunction with decreasing creatinine.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.2. Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.i.d.3.

PULMONARY EMBOLUS2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHYHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old womanwith dilated cardiomyopathy secondaryto Adriamycin , status post recent admission for increased shortnessof breath and left pleural effusion. He returns now with increasedcough productive of white phlegm and progressive dyspnea onexertion. The patient has a history of breast carcinoma in 1989 ,treated with left lumpectomy x 2 and XRT , accompanied bychemotherapy completed in early 1990. The patient then presented inJuly of 1992 with progressive dyspnea on exertion , found to havean ejection fraction of 17%. She was diagnosed with cardiomyopathyfelt secondary to Adriamycin toxicity. She was then treated withDigoxin , Lasix , Captopril and Coumadin with good result. She hadsubsequent development of SVT with a rapid ventricular rate ofapproximately 180. The patient eventually underwent EPEP studieswith therapeutic ablation. Subsequently she had done quite welluntil February of 1994 when she presented with mild coughproductive of white phlegm and increasing symptoms of right andleft-sided heart failure. She was treated with increased Lasix andDigoxin and an empiric course of amoxicillin with little change inher symptoms. She was then admitted on 8/7 after she was found tohave a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient underwentultrasound guided thoracentesis complicated by a pneumothoraxrequiring chest tube placement. Evaluation of the pleural fluidrevealed a transudative effusion with all cultures and cytologyremaining negative. The patient was treated with Ancef forapproximately 7 days while the chest tube was in place and thendischarged on 6/20/94. Since that time the patient has had noimprovement in her symptoms but rather notes increasing cough whichremains productive of white sputum with occasional "specks of red"and progression of her dyspnea on exertion. She is now unable togo greater than six steps of stair without significant dyspnea.This is a significant change from approximately one month ago whereshe was able to go two flights without extreme difficulty. She hasstable 3 + pillow orthopnea and pedal edema. Her weight hasincreased only slightly recently. She denies any fever , chills ,sweats , chest discomfort or pleuritic chest pain. She does notanorexia and malaise without myalgias or arthralgias. PAST MEDICALHISTORY: 1. Dilated cardiomyopathy as above. 2. Breast carcinomaas above. 3. Hypothyroid 4. Depression ALLERGIES: No known drugallergies. Habits , distant tobacco use , none since 1967 , no ETOH.MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 0.25 mg q day , Lasix 80 mg q day , Capoten 50mg t.i.d. , aspirin one per day , Synthroid 2 gr. per day , Tamoxifen10 mg b.i.d. , Elavil 75 mg q day , K-Dur 1 q day. SOCIAL HISTORY:The patient lives with her boyfriend , she is widowed withoutchildren. She is a semi-retired Accounts Manager. FAMILY HISTORY:There is no family history of cardiac disease.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100.6 , blood pressure 116/65 ,heart rate is 100 , respiratory rate 18. 02saturation 90% on room air. The patient is alert , responsive ,febrile and in no acute distress. Her conjunctiva are clear ,extraocular movements intact , her oropharynx is clear. She has nolymphadenopathy. Jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm at30 degrees. Lung examination is remarkable for a few rales at theleft base , decreased breath sounds at the right base with dullnessto percussion. Cardiac examination , regular rate and rhythm withnormal SI , SII , positive SIII. Abdomen is soft and non-tender ,slightly distended. She has pitting edema almost to the kneesbilaterally. Neurological examination is non focal.LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 is notable for a potassium of 5.4 andcreatinine of 1.2 with a BUN of 20. CBCdemonstrated a white count of 14 , hematocrit of 42.9 , platelets289 , Digoxin level was 1.2. Chest x-ray showed a left pleuraleffusion which is unchanged , a new right pleural effusion +-consolidation. EKG showed sinus rhythm at 98 , left axis deviation ,normal intervals , low voltage with poor R wave progression , nosignificant change compared with 7/24/94.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with a picture of chronicproductive cough , progressive dyspnea with lowgrade fevers and increased white blood cell count , in addition tonew opacity on chest x-ray. This clinical picture was felt to bemostly from a progressive infectious process superimposed onunderlying congestive heart failure versus post-obstructiveinfection versus atelectasis with an endobronchial lesion. Thepatient was started on empiric course of antibiotics includingcefotaxime and clarithromycin. She was seen in consultation by thePulmonary Service which felt that a therapeutic trial of aggressivediuresis was warranted prior to any more aggressive interventionsuch as bronchoscopy or repeat thoracentesis. The patient was thustreated with aggressive IV diuresis with excellent symptomaticresult. As her symptoms and chest x-ray cleared , it was felt thata chest CT would be valuable in evaluating her left lower lobe forpossible endobronchial lesion leading to volume loss. She thusunderwent a chest CT on 2/6/94 with demonstration of a largeperipheral , red , right lower lobe opacity , highly suggestive of aright lower lobe pulmonary infarction. No endobronchial lesions orlymphadenopathy were noted. Given the patient's history of dilatedcardiomyopathy , off anticoagulation , an extensive discussion of thechest CT findings with the Chest Radiologist and Pulmonary ConsultTeam , it was felt that the patient should be treated empiricallyfor a pulmonary embolus. She was thus started on IV Heparin withachievement of therapeutic PTT prior to switching to oral Coumadinwithout complications. In addition the patient underwent lowerextremity non-invasives which were negative for deep venousthrombosis as well as a cardiac echocardiogram which showed noevidence of RV strain or right ventricular thrombus. Of note , thisechocardiogram again demonstrated moderately large left ventriclewith severely depressed systolic function and an estimated ejectionfraction of 15-20%. Though the possibility that the wedge shapedopacification seen on CT was due to pneumonia rather thaninfarction , it was felt that given the patient's low ejectionfraction she would need to be anticoagulated on this basis alone ,and thus pulmonary angiogram or VQ scan would not be likely toalter management. The patient was discharged to home.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.

Hypertension.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old male with ahistory of CAD , CHF with an ejection fraction of 30% , atrialfibrillation ( diagnosed in 2000 , status post 4 cardioversions , onamiodarone until January 2005 , when it was discontinued due to skindiscoloration; since then , the patient has been on Toprol ) ,insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , who has done well since astent was placed in 2002 , not requiring any hospitalizations forcardiac-related issues. In July 2006 , he notes that he began tofeel weak with increased dyspnea on exertion and occasionalpalpitations , although he denied any chest pain. He was found tobe in atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin , withcontinuation of the Toprol for rate control. He was cardiovertedin September 2006 , resulting in symptomatic improvement until January 2006when he again reportedly felt weak , had increased dyspnea withexertion. An echocardiogram was done in January 2006 , showing anejection fraction of 28%. Given his increased risk for suddendeath , a single-chamber ICD was placed.He continued to feel even more unwell towards the later end ofJanuary , with episodes of nausea , diaphoresis , shortness of breath ,and abdominal pain with exertion ( these were his typical anginasymptoms in the past ). Consequently , ETT was done on 9/18/2006 ,which was terminated after 1 minute when the patient's heart ratewent up to 130. Electrophysiology adjusted his ICD , still hereports continued symptoms as previously described as well asdecreased appetite and weight gain of 15 pounds over 6 weeks. Heendorses worsening orthopnea and PND over the several weeks priorto admission. He was started on amiodarone on 11/4/2006 foratrial fibrillation. Given his worsening symptoms , he presentedto Dr. Gabard 's clinic on the day of admission for evaluation. Hewas admitted for diuresis in the setting of a CHF exacerbationand for consideration of options in the treatment of his atrialfibrillation.PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS:1. Toprol XL 50 mg b.i.d.2.

Chest x-ray , 10/27/2006 , showscardiomegaly with an interstitial process and without effusions.PROCEDURES: On 2/25/2006 , the patient was started ondofetilide.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:1. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient was started with adiuretic regimen of Lasix 40 mg IV twice a day given that heappeared to be volume overloaded by clinical exam. Onpresentation , he was compensated for his congestive heartfailure , with a creatinine of 1.6. The daily goal for his was -2to 2.5 L , and he did very well on this dose of Lasix for the inand out goal. He was switched over to Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily on10/20/2006. His Toprol was continued in-house , but his ACEinhibitor was held in the setting of increases in his serumcreatinine. The plan was to restart his ACE inhibitor followingcomplete diuresis to dry weight. There were no symptoms or signsconsistent with ischemia in-house. The patient was continued onaspirin and Zetia for hyperlipidemia.2. Atrial Fibrillation: Given the patient's history of atrialfibrillation and flutter since 2000 and his continued symptoms onToprol ( amiodarone was not an option that the patient wished topursue given the side effects of skin discoloration that he hadpreviously experienced ). It was decided to proceed withdofetilide therapy on 10/20/2006. His QTc was monitoredthroughout this process , and the plan was for a transesophagealechocardiogram and DC cardioversion on 8/7/2006 for furthertreatment of the atrial fibrillation. The patient's Coumadin wascontinued in-house for a goal INR of between 2 to 3. To achievethis goal , he was continued on his home regimen of Coumadin.3. Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was takenoff oral hypoglycemics in-house but continued on his home dose ofLantus 24 units before bedtime as well as an insulin slidingscale.An addendum will be added to this summary by Dr. Gil CicioraeScription document: 3-3270941 HFFocusDictated By: DEMOURA , LOUISAttending: PEARYER , ELMER ALEXDictation ID 1457076D: 6/28/06T: 7/7/06

On the day prior to admission ,she had a nondiagnostic exercise tolerance test , and was admittedfor cardiac catheterization on March , 1995. Upon furtherquestioning when the patient presented for catheterization , it wasfound that she had a previous allergic reaction to intravenouscontrast dye that caused laryngeal edema. For that reason , thepatient was admitted for premedication overnight prior tocatheterization.The patient , again , is a 62 year old , and is a patient of Dr.Mayer , with multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension ,diabetes , elevated cholesterol , a positive family history , andbeing a postmenopausal woman. She first noted exertionalsubsternal chest pain about four months prior to admission. Thepain radiates to her left arm , and is associated with shortness ofbreath , but no diaphoresis or nausea or vomiting. The pain isrelieved by rest within two minutes , or by a sublingualNitroglycerin , which she has used in the past week x two.

He developed acute onset ofsubsternal chest pain while riding on a train home from Mon Ph PidsThe pain radiated to both arms , left greater than right , jaw andwas associated with shortness of breath , nausea , and sweats. Hepresented to the emergency room at the outside hospital and hadan EKG two hours later showing marked ST elevations in V2 and V3 ,1 aVL and was reciprocal ST depressions inferiorly. The patientwas treated with aspirin , heparin , Plavix , and sublingualnitroglycerin , Lopressor , Integrilin and was transferred to theEttecile Valley Hospital for an emergent PCI.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Significant for type 2 diabetes controlled only with oralhypoglycemics ( glyburide ) , anxiety.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:Glyburide 10 mg p.o. q.d.ALLERGIES:No known drug allergies.SOCIAL HISTORY:Of note , the patient recently with stress relating to his placeof work. The patient is expected a job interview on day ofadmission to the hospital. The patient lives with his wife whohad an MI one year ago. The patient has no history of tobaccowith occasional alcohol one to two times a month , denies use ofstreet drugs.PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:The patient was alert and oriented and in moderate amount ofdistress secondary to anxiety following his cath. Vital Signs:He had a temp of 100.2 , his blood pressure was 120/79 , and hisheart rate was 96 beats per minute. He was satting at 96% on 2 Lof nasal cannula. HEENT: His JVP was at 9 cm , he had 2+ carotidswithout bruits. His extraocular motions were intact. His pupilswere equal , round , and reactive to light. His cardiac exam wassignificant for regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , and an S4.There were no murmurs.

Bowel sounds were present.Extremities: He had 2+ pedal pulses. There was no pitting edema.Skin: Noted to be hypopigmented , the patient has a history ofalbinism. Of note , one additional comment about his HEENT exam ,the patient is legally blind. He is able to see most objects atabout 6 or 7 feet away from him.His chest x-ray showed a right middle opacification concerningfor an infiltrative pneumonia. His EKG on admission post cathshowed a rate of 98 , sinus rhythm , and ST elevations 2 mm in V2through V3 and ST depressions in leads II , III , and aVF. Labs onadmission were significant for creatinine of 1.4 up from abaseline of 1.2. His cardiac enzymes showed a CK of 178 and MBof 3.7 and troponin of less than assay.

His UA was significant for a specificgravity of 1.086 , 1+ protein , 3+ glucose , 2+ ketones , 2+ blood ,1-3 white blood cells , 2-4 red blood cells , and trace bacteria.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1. CV: Ischemia. An emergent cath on admission on 2/18/04showed two-vessel disease and 100% LAD , osteal lesion , and a 90%marginal 1 lesion. The LAD was stented with a 3.5 x 8 mm and a3.0 x 13 mm and a 3.0 x 18 mm Cipher stents all to 0%. Themarginal 1 was not stented during this cath. The patient's CKpeaked at 10 , 438 , and a CK-MB at 452 and his troponin at 721.The patient was transferred to the CCU after his cath. He wastreated with aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , Integrilinx12 hours. The patient recovered well except for his heart rateremained in tachycardiac at 90 to 110 range despite Lopressorwhich was increased to 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. With the setting oftachycardia , he developed ST elevation in 1 aVL with STdepressions and 3 aVF in the evening of 3/7/04 , although hiscardiac enzymes continued to turn down. The patient underwent asecond cath on 8/12/04 , which showed that all his stents placedin his LAD previously remained patent. The marginal 1 wasstented at this time with Cipher stent 0. The patient was doingvery well after his second procedure. His heart rate remainedslightly tachycardiac , the patient experienced no further EKGchanges.2. Pump: The patient was on Lopressor and captopril , and hisblood pressure remained stable after his procedures. Echo on2/10/04 showed an LVEF of 30% as well as akinesis of the middistal anterior wall felt in the entire apex. There washypokinesis of the basal anterior septum and the basal to midlateral wall with preserved function of the basal to mid inferiorand posterior wall. The apex is near aneurysmal. The patientwas put on heparin GTT given the risk of intraventricularthrombus. The patient was started on Coumadin prior todischarge.3. Rhythm and rate: The patient remained mildly tachycardiac.His Lopressor was titrated up to 100 mg q.i.d. for rate controlbut no concerning arrhythmias were noted on telemetry. His sinustachycardia was thought to be secondary to a bacterial pneumonia.4. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes. The hemoglobinA1c was 10.57 demonstrating the patient's conservative treatmentwas insufficient. He was started on NPH and insulin slidingscale in the hospital. Metformin was started on 1/12/04 , and hewas restarted on Glucotrol before discharge. Diabetic teachingwas instituted.5. Renal: Mucomyst was given before and after both of hiscaths. His creatinine turned into his baseline of 1.2.6. Heme: The patient was sent home on Coumadin given hisechocardiogram significant for near aneurysmal LV and ahypokinetic apex. The patient will need to be followed inCoumadin Clinic. Code status for this patient remained fullthroughout his hospitalization.7. Pulmonary: The patient was noted to be febrile and to have aright middle lobe infiltrate on admission. The patient wastreated with five days of levofloxacin but remained febrile andtachycardiac. The patient was started on azithromycin for atotal of five-day course. The patient defervesced after 24 hoursof being on azithromycin. Also of note , on a follow-up chestx-ray prior to discharge , was read as the patient having aquestion of a cavitating lesion in his right lobe.

CVS: Ischemia: NSTEMI: contined medical management with asa , betablocker , imdur , zocor , ntg prn. The CkMB peaked at 12 and Tni to 4. Hiscardiologist ( Dr Benisek ) recommended PET scan to assess for viablemyocardium and ischemia. His last stress test 1 year ago showed onlyscarring with no ischemia. In the past , pt's wife refused for him to gofor CABG. They are reconsidering this option currently.The results of the PET scan are as follows:- A small region of myocardial scar/hibernation along with mildresidual stress induced peri-infarct ischemia in the distal LADdistribution.- Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction.- The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of February ,2003.The family was called to stress the importance of follow up withcardiology ( They have missed appointments in the past )Pump: ( EF 20-25% ) , increased enalapril to 10mg bid , BNP was sent andpending and echo revealed EF 30% , Mod AI.Rhythm: no events occurred on telemetry2.

Possible etiologies include TIA or illnessexacerbating deficits from old stroke. Head CT in ER showed oldinfarcts , but no acute process. Patient did not have any speechdifficulties throughout admission or other neurologic findings.CV: ischemia: No ST changes on EKG , one set of cardiac enzymes werenegative. Given low probability of ischemia , no further enzymes weredrawn. Pump: EF 55% , patient was normotensive even after d/c ofsome of her home HTN meds ( see renal ). Rhythm: pt was on telemetry forfirst day of admission , and alternated between sinus rhythm and afib.Pulm: PNA: pt had left lower lobe opacity on CXR. Decision was made tostart antibiotics. Pt had a positive d-dimer , but PE was very unlikelyin the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient has ahistory of CHF , but had no signs of CHF on exam during thishospitalizaiton although her cxr was read as mild pulmonary edema.Renal: ARF: Creatine on admission was 1.8 , up from a baseline of1.2-1.3. Given her h/o poor po intake and euvolemic to dry exam ,this was thought likely due to prerenal hypovolemia. Herlasix , lisinopril and colchicine were held , as they might contribute tofurther ARF , and she got gentle ivf ( approximately 1L ) and hercreatinine improved. However , after restarting her medications her Cragain bumped to 1.8. Her UA was unremarkable. She was d/c home offlasix , lisinopril and colchicine with a Cr of 1.8 presuming that she was still prerenal. The plan is for VNA to check her chem7 in 3daysdays , results to go to Dr. Skibo for monitoring and deciding when torestart her medications.MSK: Pt developed the left forearm swelling and pain while in the hospfor the first night. A radiograph was negative for fracture and it wasfelt to be a small hematoma. The pain remitted with Tylenol. Atdischarge the pain was a dull ache , and the swelling was reduced.Heme: Anticoagulation. She was maintained on her home dose of INR wasmaintained in a theraputic range. This will have to be closelymonitored as an outpatient while on levofloxacin. Her INR was 3 after 2days of levofloxacin and will be checked again by VNA 3 daysafter discharge , results to be followed by Sheldon DingmannEndo: D.M. Pt was switched from micronase to glipizide 2.5mg qd givenher worsening renal insufficiency. Fingersticks remained in acceptablerange ( 100-148 ) during admission.Dispo: to home with close VNA followup ( daily ). Pt will have weightand BP checked qd. She will have Chem-7 and INR drawn on Thursday andMonday , and the results will be called to Dr. Benamati ( TERT VALLEY HOSPITAL CENTER ). She willfinish 6 more days of Levo ( total 10 ).ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you develop a fever , become short of breath , have increasing left armpain , or any other symptoms that concern you , call your doctor.The visiting nurse is an important followup to yourhospitalization.Your diabetes medication was changed to glipizide -stoptaking the micronase. Your lasix , lisinopril and colchicine have beenstopped , don't restart them until Dr. Schoville tells you to restart. Your othemedications are the same. Weigh yourself daily and if your weight increases more than 2lbs in 2 days call Dr. SzesterniakDISCHARGE CONDITION: StableTO DO/PLAN:1. VNA will check BP and weight qd. Any BP > 140/90 or wt gain of 2lbs in 2 days will be called to Dr. Kempf ( BROTHERSCIAL GITER HEALTHCARE OF 703-958-5135 )2. Thursday ( 20 of September ) and Mon ( 1 of April ) VNA will draw a Chem-7 and INRand call results to Dr. Maria ( WA ASSPUNX HOSPITAL ); INR should be communicated to Blaine Lindquist at 731-463-2245.3.

He had been behaving unlikehimself and was having black tarry stools for two days. The patient was foundtobe guaiac positive. A head CT showed no new lesions but did showmultiple infarcts that were known to be old. On 10/18/06 , thepatient had an EGD showing clot in the distal esophagus. Thisclot was removed , and the possible culprit vessel was clipped.Around midnight on 8/19/06 , the patient became borderlinehypertension for an unclear reason. His hematocrit wasstable. The patient's ACE inhibitor and beta-blockerwere held. Also , the patient's Lasix washeld. On 8/19/06 at around 4:00 a.m. , the patient wasreportedly having fitful sleeping and went to the bathroom. Soonafterwards , the nurse noticed that the patient was having moreectopy on telemetry. Soon after 4:30 a.m. , the patient waseither found unresponsive or ventricular fibrillation was seen ontelemetry and a code was called. The rhythm was shown to beV-fib. Chest compressions were initiated , and the patient wasshocked. Soon thereafter , he had two more shock episodes forV-fib and was loaded on amiodarone 300 mg IV x1. Soonthereafter , his V-fib terminated and subsequently , the patienthad an episode of slow PEA treated with atropine , epinephrine ,calcium and magnesium. Code labs showed a potassium of 3.3. Thepatient was intubated. A left femoral line was placed. Thepatient was transported to the CCU with stable blood pressure onneosynephrine. He was easily weaned off neosynephrine. Thepatient does not have any history of an arrhythmia.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:The patient's past medical history is significant for:;1. coronary artery disease status post CABG ( SVG to RCA ) with mitral valvereplacement in 1999. In 2003 , thepatient underwent catheterization for unstable angina. The LADand D1 were stented. In 2004 , the patient underwentcatheterization for unstable angina showing restenosis of D1which was re-stented.2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.3. CVA.4. Seizure disorder.5.

NovoLog 12 units q.a.c.SOCIAL HISTORY:The patient was not known to be a smoker or to use alcohol.ALLERGIES:desquamating rash to phenytoin and also a possibleallergy to Ancef which occurred during this hospitalization.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:On admission on 10/20/06 , the patient's vital signs weretemperature 98.3 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 122/73 , respiratoryrate 16 , O2 sat 97% on room air. He was not in any acutedistress. He was alert and oriented x3. He was interactive andappropriate. Skin was normal. HEENT showed an old left-sidedfacial droop which was unchanged per patient and the family. TheJVP was 6 cm. There was no lymphadenopathy. The chest wasclear. Cardiac exam showed a mechanical S1 and normal S2 , noextra sounds or murmurs. Abdominal exam was benign. Extremitieshad 2+ pulses without clubbing , cyanosis or edema. Neurologicalexam showed a left-sided facial hemiparesis. Otherwise , cranialnerves II through XII were intact. The patient had 4/5 strengthon the left side , 5/5 strength on the right side. Toes weredowngoing.ADMISSION LABS:Labs on admission were notable for a creatinine of 1.7 , glucoseof 237 , hematocrit of 37.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:10/18/06 , elective inpatient EGD for heme-positive black stoolperformed by Dr. Marlin Shigo in the presence of Dr. Val BlacheOn 11/16/06 , urgent cardiac cathet1erization for cardiac arrestperformed by Dr. Monte Lenig with stent placement in thecircumflex.On 4/22/06 , dual chamber ICD placed by Dr. DanniHOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:This is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease andmitral valve replacement. He was initially admitted for an upperGI bleed and was then admitted to the CCU status post V-fib arrestand found to have NSTEMI. His course in the CCU was as follows:1. Cardiovascular:A. Ischemia: NSTEMI. The patient had a troponin elevationbeginning 15 minutes after a code was started , suggesting that the NSTEMIoccurredand then caused V-fib arrest. The peak troponin was 111.Cardiac catheterization showed severe 3-4 vessel disease ,and occlusion of the SVG graft. Two drug-eluting stents were placedin the left circumflex. The patient was treated with aspirin ,Plavix , beta-blocker , and ACE. The patient's beta-blocker andACE doses were titrated during his hospital stay. The patientwas also taken off of Lipitor briefly due to concern about hisliver function. At discharge , he is being restarted on hisoutpatient doses of Lipitor as well as a Fibrate.B. Pump: The patient had congestive heart failure causingpulmonary edema. By echo , he had an ejection fraction of 25-30%with a moderately dilated left ventricle , severe globalhypokinesis with posterior and inferior akinesis. The patientdiuresed well during his CCU stay and on the floor. His I's andO's were followed. He was net negative , and he was dischargedat a weight of 87 kilos. The patient had an echo to evaluatefor dyssynchrony. This echo did not find significant evidence ofdyssynchrony.C. Rhythm: The patient had a V-fib arrest and returned tonormal sinus rhythm. He received an amiodarone load as well asamiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. After he stabilized , the amiodarone wasdiscontinued after AICD implantation on on 7/1/06. The implantation itselfwas uncomplicated though the patient developed hives thought to be due toadministration of prophylactic Ancef. The patient was switchedto vancomycin for prophylaxis , followed by po clindamycin. His allergicsymptomsresolved with one dose of IV Benadryl.2. GI: The patient came in with an upper GI bleed. A bleedingvessel at the GE junction was clipped. The patient had atransient LFT elevation consistent with shock liver. LFTs werefollowed and declined appropriately during his hospitalizationand normalized before discharge. The patient was also maintainedon a proton pump inhibitor during his stay.3. Hematocrit: The patient was transfused two units of red bloodcells on 4/12/06 and 9/28/06. His hematocrit remained stable therafter. Thepatient was taking Lovenox as anoutpatient for protection of his mechanical mitral valve. Duringthe peri-procedure period for his ICD implantation , the patientwas switched to heparin drip and was maintained on the heparindrip for four days after device implantation. At that time , hewas restarted on his outpatient regimen of Lovenox 70 mg b.i.d.4. Neuro: The patient has a history of CVA with a residual lefthemiparesis. These symptoms were stable. The patient was alsoseen by the Psychiatry Service to evaluate his memory deficitsand abilities to make decisions. The Psychiatry team recommendedthat the patient be followed by Neurology after discharge andthat the patient be considered for a formal neuropsychiatrictesting for evaluation of his neurologic and cognitive deficits.5. Pulmonary: The patient's pulmonary edema resolved withdiuresis.6. ID: The patient presented with fever and an elevated whiteblood cell count initially and a question of an infiltrate on chestx-ray. This patient was covered with levofloxacin and Flagyl forthree days empirically for aspiration pneumonia. Duringhospitalization , he did have very transient low-gradetemperatures on two other occasions. Cultures including chestx-ray , urine and blood cultures were negative. The patient was afebrile priorto discharge. As of the day ofthis dictation , C. difficile tests were also negative.7. Renal: The patient's creatinine was elevated reaching a peakof 1.9 on 4/12/06 in the setting of his cardiac arrest. Thepatient's creatinine normalized and on the day prior to dischargewas 1.2.8. Nutrition: The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow.Initially , he was put on a puree-thin diet that was advanced tomechanical soft and thin liquids prior to discharge.9. Endocrine: The patient is diabetic and was maintained on NPH22 units b.i.d. and a sliding scale. At the time of discharge ,the patient's blood sugars were well controlled. He is beingdischarged on Lantus 48 units at bedtime ( a light increase over his outpatinetdose ) as well as a NovoLog sliding scale for coverage during meals.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:On the day of discharge , the patient was afebrile.

He was admitted to the CardiologyService for cardiac catheterization. His history began in l976when he presented with substernal chest pain and shortness ofbreath. In l98l , he experienced an anterior myocardial infarctionand in October of l98l , underwent a three-vessel coronary arterybypass graft with mitral valve replacement. He did fairly wellwith no recurrent symptoms until September of l989 when he presentedwith congestive heart failure and ruled out for myocardialinfarction. A thallium exercise treadmill test revealedinferoapical ischemia and the patient was continued with medicaltherapy. He did well until one to two weeks prior to admissionwhen he developed chest pain which radiated to the left arm and waspersistent for three hours after which time it was treated withNitroglycerin at Re Lalakety Wood,rank Hospital and resolved. An exercisetreadmill test was stopped secondary to shortness of breath andthallium scan revealed inferoapical scarring and septal apicalreperfusion abnormality. The patient subsequently underwentcardiac catheterization at Dentan Lascrople whichrevealed l00% occlusion of his left anterior descending graft andpatent posterior descending artry graft and OM2 graft. His nativevessels were remarkable for significant disease throughout his leftanterior descending , an l00% circumflex lesion at the obtusemarginal l , l00% proximal obtuse marginal lesion , and l00% rightcoronary artery occlusion. Left ventriculogram revealed anejection fraction of 0.6 with apical hypokinesis. The patient wasreferred to Cardiac Surgery Service for evaluation and coronaryartery bypass grafting was elected. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Remarkable for diet controlled diabetes mellitus , history of anasymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm , and a hiatal hernia.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Inderal , Procardia , Aspirin , Lasix , Pepcid ,Maalox , Nitrol Paste , and intravenous Heparin. ALLERGIES: Noknown drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has alongstanding cigarette smoking history which was stopped in l98l.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: As above.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a pleasant moderately obese male inno acute distress. HEAD/NECK: Withinnormal limits. CHEST: Clear bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rateand rhythm. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES: Without cyanosis ,clubbing , or edema with good peripheral pulses.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Electrocardiogram revealed sinusbradycardia with first degree AV block andright bundle-branch block.HOSPITAL COURSE: On July , patient underwent coronary arterybypass grafting and a left internal mammaryartery was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery.The patient tolerated the procedure well. Post-operatively , thepatient developed intermittent rhythm disturbances with severalepisodes of ventricular ectopy and bradycardia which were not feltto be significant enough to warrant further investigation by theCardiology Service. The patient developed a blood culture that waspositive for enterobacter and the patient subsequently underwentplacement of a Hickman catheter to receive a four week dose ofGentamicin and Ceftriaxone. This was well tolerated withoutcomplication.DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good. The patient isdischarged home and will receive a full course offour weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy.

CT onadmission noted a diverticular abscess. CT was unable to drain itdue to its limited size. However , the patient continued to havecrampy abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting. The patient was takento the OR on 10/19/01 for an exploratory laparotomy , sigmoidcolectomy and colostomy. The patient tolerated the procedure welland was maintained NPO , with an epidural for pain control , untilreturn of bowel function as witnessed by the gas and feces in thecolostomy bag.By the time of discharge , the patient was ambulating with a wheeledwalker. She was tolerating a regular diet , had good pain controlon 2-4 mg q.4h. of Dilaudid. Of note , the patient has asignificant history of coronary artery disease , had a rule out MIpostoperatively with initial evidence of cardiac injury. However ,the patient did complain of some atypical chest pain onpostoperative day #3. A repeat rule out MI illustrated a troponinleak likely secondary to increased cardiac demands postoperatively.The patient was started on diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. in order tocontrol rates with a good effect. The patient was also continuedon a course of IV antibiotics , ampicillin , ceftazidime , Flagyl andDiflucan. Drainage from that particular abscess eventuallyrevealed enterococci , yeast and Pseudomonas responsive to theseantibiotics.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: ( 1 ) Routine colostomy care and teaching.( 2 ) Wet-to-dry dressings t.i.d. to openabdominal wound.

His first presentation with coronary diseasewas in 1986 , when he ruled in for MI and a cath revealed 100%occlusion of the circumflex , 99% D1 , and a subsequent angioplastyof the circ to a 70% residual. He had an exercise treadmill twomonths later and a repeat cath at that time showed 95% restenosisof the circ and a 60% LAD lesion , and a 90% D1. In October of1992 the patient again presented with exertional angina. Cathrevealed 70% occlusion of the RCA , 70-80% LAD , and diffuse diseasein the circumflex with a 50% mid-circumflex lesion. He had diffuseglobal hypokinesis and an EF of 40-50%. His angina progressed andin 1994 he underwent a four vessel CABG , SVG to the PDA and OM-1 ,and a LIMA to the LAD and D2. He did well until 1997 , when hepresented with presyncope and was found to have a massive saddlepulmonary embolism. He had a negative hypercoagulative workupafter this. In the recent years he has had a number of episodes ofepigastric pain with exertion and positive stress tests , but noadditional myocardial infarctions. His most recent cath in Julyof 1997 showed an occluded circumflex , 80% LAD , and subtotalocclusion distally , a 60% mid-RCA lesion , and patent SVG to the PDAand the OM , as well as the LIMA to the LAD. In recent months thepatient describes increasing frequency of anginal episodes provokedby walking more than five minutes or climbing stairs. Most oftenthe pain is epigastric , but occasionally substernal. He deniesassociated symptoms of nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation of thepain , but says it is hard to catch his breath. The patient deniesorthopnea , PND , or lower extremity edema. He has never had pain atrest. On February the patient underwent an exercise treadmilltest walking five minutes on the standard Bruce protocol , reachinga heart rate of 96 and a blood pressure of 130/70. He had chestpain as well as 1 mm ST depressions. Since then his angina hasoccurred with less and less exertion until the morning ofadmission , when he walked outside and experienced substernal chesttightness. He again denies nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations , orradiation of the pain , but does have some shortness of breath. Thepain lasts approximately 10-15 minutes and the patient was advisedby his cardiologist , Dr. Raymond Merrihew , to come to the EmergentDepartment. In the Emergent Department he was pain free andreceived aspirin and was started on heparin. EKG showed no acutechanges. CK was 47 and a troponin of 0.24.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes , hypertension ,hypercholesterolemia , chronic DVTs withpulmonary embolism x two , CVA , left temporal in the setting of anINR of 4 , with some residual memory and expressive deficits. He isnow on Lovenox subcu for DVT prophylaxis. Chronic renalinsufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , hepatitis Bpositive , and recent eye surgery in January of 2001.ALLERGIES: Benadryl , which causes shortness of breath.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Avandia 4mg p.o. b.i.d. , atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day , aspirin 325 mg q. day ,gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate 60 , bloodpressure 110/90 , upper 70 , oxygensaturation 98% on 2 L. In general , he is a 63-year-old Asian male ,well appearing and in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal ,round , and reactive. Extraocular muscles intact. Oral mucosa aremoist. There is no jugular venous distention , no lymphadenopathy.Neck is supple. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , withoutwheezes or rales. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm ,without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , nondistended ,and mildly tender to palpation in the epigastrium. There is norebound or guarding. Extremities are warm and well perfused , withno edema.INITIAL LABORATORIES: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 106 ,bicarb 24 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.5 , glucose253 , white count 5.3 , hematocrit 36.8 , platelets 144 , calcium 9.5 ,mag 1.7 , CK 47 , troponin slightly elevated at 0.23 , INR 1.1. EKGreveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 , with normal axis and inferiorlyflattened T waves , with T in 1 , L in 6.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascularly , the patient was continuedon heparin and ruled out for MI by CKs. On 10/21he underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed an 80% proximalLAD , 100% proximal circ , 80% proximal RCA , and 80% proximal rightPDA. His LIMA to the D2 and the LAD were patent , as was the SVG toOM-1. The SVG to the RCA was 100% occluded. A stent was placed inthe native mid-RCA and angioplasty was undertaken of the right PDA.After the procedure , the heparin was discontinued and he wastransitioned to Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day for DVT prophylaxis. Anecho was obtained , which showed mildly enlarged left ventricle withmoderate reduction in function and EF of 35%. There is thinningand hypokinesis to akinesis of the posterior and inferior segments ,as well as hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal septum. The RVwas normal. Pulmonary artery pressures are 25+ right atrialpressure. The patient continues to have episodes of epigastricdiscomfort and belching , and his EKG revealed only nonspecific Twave changes. He was scheduled to undergo a submax exercisetreadmill test , but this was held due to an increase in histroponin initially from .23 to .73 , suggesting that he was havingsome mild ischemia with the likely culprit being the small PDA thathad been angioplastied during cath. Recath was thought to be lowyield without anything to intervene upon after discussion with theinterventional Cardiology Service. His medical regimen wasmaximized and included a beta blocker , ACE inhibitor , and nitrates.His cardiac enzymes trended down to a CK of 32 and a troponin of0.33 upon discharge. He underwent submaximum ETT on 3/10 andwalked for nine minutes without EKG changes , but did experience6/10 chest pain and some belching. The test was consideredconsistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. Of note , hereached a max heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 142/80during this submaximum stress test. The patient will be dischargedto home to have close follow-up with his cardiologist , Dr. Devin Peachey He will also have a follow-up stress test. He will see hisprimary care physician , Dr. Panciera , for monitoring of his othermedical issues , including his diabetes. Discharge condition isstable , discharge diet is low fat diabetic diet , and dischargemedications are enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 10 mgp.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg onetab sublingual a.q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , ramipril 5mg p.o. q. day , Lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day x 70 days , Plavix 75 mgp.o. q. day x 25 days ( a total of 30 days since the stent ) , Lipitor10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , and Avandia 4 mg p.o. b.i.d.Dictated By: TORY GETACHEW , M.D. BH71Attending: DANTE H.

The patient has had diarrhea for years , but thisepisode was more severe and it was accompanied by nausea andvomiting. Upon evaluation , she was found to have heme negativestool. An abdominal CT showed a focal segment of colitis at thesplenic flexure with significant atheromatous disease of the SMA.Findings were worrisome for mesenteric ischemia. As part of herpreoperative evaluation , she underwent a stress MIBI which showedanterolateral , apical , and inferoposterior ischemia consistent withthree-vessel disease or left main disease. She does reportintermittent chest pressure and shortness of breath at rest andwith mild exertion over the past few years , increasing in the last threemonths. She also reports two-pillow orthopnea and PMD. Giventhese findings , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization on6/11/04 as well as evaluation for celiac , SMA and IMA.Catheterization showed 40% left main lesion. Otherwise , patentcoronary artery.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:Includes diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c of 5.7 in 9/15 ,hypertension , question of COPD , depression , coronary arterydisease with an echo showing an EF of 45% on baseline inferiorhypokinesis.MEDICATIONS:Lasix , atenolol , bupropion , Fosamax , metformin , and lisinopril.She has no known drug allergies.On physical exam , the patient was afebrile with a heart rate of72 , blood pressure of 132/61 , respiratory rate 20 , with an O2saturation of 93% on room air. Cardiovascular exam wasremarkable for a regular heart rate with a normal S1 and S2.Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam wasremarkable for quiet by all sounds. No tenderness and nodistention. Extremities had no edema , 2+ dorsalis pedis pulsesbilaterally.Abdominal angiography showed patent celiac SMA and IMA.There was enhanced vascularity in the definitive or slidingflexure but no embolic or angiographic cut off. The patient wastreated with NG tube to suction which improved his symptomsalthough she cotinued to have.LAB DATA: Remarkable for negative cardiac enzymes x3. Calciumand magnesium , and potassium were repleted as needed. EKG wasunchanged with normal sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.Remainder of hospital course:1. Cardiovascular: The patient was started on mild Lasix diuresis forshortness of breath with slight improvement in symptoms.Echocardiogram showed an ejection fracture of 50% with thickaortic valve , thick mitral valve with trace MR , trace TR andhypokinesis. There is severe baseline anteroseptaldistal-lateral apical hypokinesis and base posterior wall ismildly hyperkinetic. Compared to report from 7/17 , LVfunction appeared slightly worse. She was continued on aspirin ,ACE inhibitor , beta-blocker , statin. She was mainly in normalsinus rhythm but due to recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillationwith rapid ventricular rate , she remained under rate control withbeta-blockers.2. GI: The patient was n.p.o. with an NG tube to suction for thefirst several days of her admission with resolution of nausea andvomiting with continued diarrhea. Her diet was advanced toclears and then a low-residue diet , which she toleratedwell. Her workup for chronic diarrhea included C. diff. , stoolcultures , fecal leukocytes , fecal fat , TSH , ESR , ANA , which wereall negative. Celiac sprue serologies were also sent and werepending upon discharge. At this point , GI was consulted and thepatient underwent a colonoscopy and EGD. Colonoscopy showeddiverticula in the rectus sigmoid. There is overlying erythemaover the splenic flexure with shallow erosions suggestive ofischemic colitis. Random biopsies were taken to rule outmicroscopic colitis. EGD was unremarkable. Biopsies wereobtained and are pending to rule out H. pylori. Colonoscopy andEGD biopsies should be followed up as an outpatient. Likelyetiology secondary to microscopic ischemia secondary tomalabsorption of celiac sprue.:3. Infectious diseases: She completed a six-day course ofampicillin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl. On 6/11/04 , the patientremained C. diff negative during the hospitalization.4. Pulmonary: Shortness of breath likely secondary to pulmonaryprocess or underlying pulmonary disease in light of normal heartfunction which should be followed up as an outpatient.5. Endocrine: Metformin was held during the hospitalizationsecondary to contrast administration. She remained on a regularinsulin sliding scale with adequate blood sugar control.6. Renal: The patient was hydrated , pre and post di-loads withunremarkable course of renal function.7. Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on subcu heparin andPepcid.The patient was stable , tolerating p.o. intake and p.o. meds.She was discharged to rehab and will follow up with her primarycare physician and with cardiology and GI.eScription document: 9-9509837 EMSSten TelDictated By: CHANCY , HARLANDAttending: CHIRCO , ALEXDictation ID 9403542D: 8/23/04T: 8/23/04

Thepatient does not recall having fevers at home , however , notesthat he "get fevers all the time" so he feels that he may nothave noticed. He did report that he had a temperature to about101 and hemodialysis prior to admission for which he received onedose of vancomycin. He denied having any symptoms of headache ,chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , joint aches orrash. He did endorse feeling fatigued with little energy. Thepatient was referred to the Emergency Department given histemperature of 101 at hemodialysis.The patient has a long history of pain in his left foot secondaryto Charcot joint and chronic recurrent cellulitis including ahistory of MRSA cellulitis. He has had numerous admissions toSMC in the past year for treatment of the foot for which hereceived several courses of antibiotics. He was treated from10/5 through 10/24 with antibiotics posthemodialysis. Atthe end of 10/24 , after returning from weekend away he hadsevere exacerbation of the pain in his left foot with progressivedevelopment of swelling on the bottom of his foot. At this time ,he had extensive evaluation including an MRI of the foot and itwas felt that there was no evidence of osteomyelitis. Hisantibiotics were discontinued at this time and he was dischargedto a nursing home for rehabilitation. He remained in the nursinghome from 1/18 through 5/22 and was discharged home twoweeks prior to admission.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Diabetes since the age of 23 , unclear if it is type 1 or type2. The patient reports that he has a history of type 1 diabetes ,but also reports that he had been without insulin for three yearsafter diagnosis. He does have consequent neuropathy ,retinopathy , and nephropathy.2. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis since 7/173. Diabetic neuropathy in his legs bilaterally and Charcot feetbilaterally.4. History of a left foot , fourth metatarsal osteomyelitis withsurgical resection of the left fourth digit.5. Retinopathy with history of retinal hemorrhage andvitrectomy.6. Hypertension x19 years with a history of malignanthypertension with documented ophthalmologic and renalinvolvement.7. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.8. Hyperlipidemia.9. Recurrent lower extremity cellulitis.10. History of chronic right foot ulcer.HOME MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. daily ,gemfibrozil 600 mg b.i.d. , Lantus 30 mg subcu q.p.m. , Lipitor 80mg nightly , Nephrocaps , Neurontin 300 mg daily , PhosLo 2001 mgt.i.d. , Protonix 40 mg daily , Renagel 3200 mg t.i.d. , Requip 2 mgp.o. b.i.d. , CoumadinALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for diabetes.SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his parents and his12-year-old daughter.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: The patient had a temperature100.8 , heart rate of 111 , a blood pressure of 140/70 , he wassatting 95% on room air. Physical exam on admission notable fora 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left lowersternal border. His left lower extremity was notable for 1+pitting edema with erythema on the anterior shin and as well asthe foot. It was also associated with increased warmth.PERTINENT STUDIES:Radiology:CXR ( 9/10/06 ): no acute cardiopulmonary diseaseMRI LE ( 10/23/06 ): 4 cm fluid pocket in the subcutaneous tissue ofthe plantar aspect of the left foot demonstrating communicationwith themedial tendon sheaths and the ankle joint with findings worrisomefor abscess and osteomyelitis of at least the medial malleolus ,calcaneus , cuboid and talus.Labs:LFTs: WNLAlb 2.8ESR 75 , CRP 276Hep B surf Ag negative , HCV Ab negative ( 2/22/06 )Micro:Blood cx 1/12/7 , 6 growthFoot aspirate ( 2/22/06 ): gram stain-2+ polys , no org; Cx withoutgrowthAnkle aspirate ( 2/22/06 ): gm stain-4+ polys , no org; Cx withoutgrowthPathology from L BKA ( 1/3/06 )-clean marginsCONSULTS:Orthopedics ( Dr. Bourgault ) , ID ( Dr. Antinoro ) , Psychiatry ( Dr.Czach ) , Acute Pain Service.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1 ) ID-Given his presentation of L lower leg swelling anderythema , Mr. Bock was started on Vancomycin and Unasyn in theemergency department. An X-ray of his L foot revealed significantfragmentation and erosion of the tarsal/metatarsal bases andfocal soft tissue abnormality in the plantar region concerningfor abscess formation and possible osteomyelitis in the settingof known Charcot arthropathy as well as diffuse soft tissueswelling extending along the calf. Given these findings , he wasordered for an MRI. With his MRI pending and his L leg lookingsomewhat improved , his Unasyn was discontinued on HD 3 and he wasstarted on Augmentin and his Vancomycin was continued given hishistory of MRSA cellulitis in the past. He spiked a fever on HD 3and again on HD 4. On HD 5 , he had an MRI under conscioussedation ( was attempted prior to this , but pt unable totolerate ). MRI revealed 4 cm fluid pocket in the subcutaneoustissue of the plantar aspect of the left foot demonstratingcommunication with the medial tendon sheaths and the ankle jointwith findings worrisome for abscess and osteomyelitis of at leastthe medial malleolus , calcaneus , cuboid and talus. Infectiousdisease was consulted and he was started on IV Levofloxacin andIV Flagyl to cover gram negatives and anaerobes respectively andhis vancomycin continued to be dosed for level less than 20.Orthopedics was consulted who performed an arthrocentesis of hisankle as well as an arthrocentesis of the fluid collection at thebottom of his foot. Ankle aspirate gram stain was negative , butwith 4+ polys. Fluid differential revealed >160 , 000 WBCs. Inconsultation with infectious disease , orthopedics , and thepatient , it was decided that the best course of action would be aL below knee amputation given the extent of the infection. Thiswas performed on HD 8 by Dr. Miears He did have fever spikesagain on HD 8-9 and had repeat blood cultures which werenegative. An echocardiogram was performed on HD 12. While he didhave a tiny focal thickening of the aortic cusp , this wasreviewed with Cardiology and infectious disease and was notthough to represent a vegetation. He was afebrile x >48 hoursprior to discharge. His surgical pathology returned with cleanmargins on day of discharge , and as per ID consult service , hedoes not need further antibiotics. He should have dry steriledressing changes to his residual limb daily. He may need an extradose of pain medication prior to this. If there is any evidenceof erythema or drainage , Dr. Fuller 's office should becontacted at 365-299-5817.2 ) Renal-Mr. Merriweather was on the renal service and had hemodialysis3 times a week ( M/W/F ) without complication. Of note , he isawaiting kidney transplant from his sister and is followed by Dr.Felix Zelle at NNH .3 ) Heme-Mr Vaeth was on coumadin as an outpatient. We obtainedhis hospital records from NUOM and a vascular study from 9/19showed evidence of a DVT in the L internal jugular vein from5/5 The details surrounding this DVT are not documented ,however Mr. Tirona reports that his vascular surgeon told himthat he should remain on Coumadin. His coumadin was held prior togoing to the OR and he was placed on a heparin drip. His coumadinwas restarted after his BKA and he was bridged with heparin witha goal PTT of 60-80. Prior to discharge , he PTT was 103 and hisheparin drip was decreased from 2100 to 1950units per hours. Heshould have a repeat PTT checked on transfer to his acuterehabilitation center with goal PTT 60-80. INR on day ofdischarge was 1.8 , 1.6 day prior to discharge. His heparin dripcan be discontinued once his INR is therapeutic with goal of 2-3.His INR will need to be followed every 2-3 days until stable offof levofloxacin.4 ) CVIschemia-Mr Grana was on gemfibrozil 600mg bid and lipitor 80mgas an outpatient. His lipid panel was checked: TC 140 , TG 151 ,LDL 82 , HDL 28. Given that his LDL was 82 and the risk ofrhabdomylosis on high dose gemfibrozil and lipitor , his lipitorwas decreased to 20mg. He should have a repeat lipid panel in 4-6weeks. He was also started on low dose b-blocker to reduceperioperative MI risk prior to his surgery. He reported that heis not on aspirin given that he has had b/l vitrectomies and hisdoctor felt that the risk of bleeding was too high. This can bereaddressed as an outpatient.Pump-Pt had elevated systolic blood pressures to the 160s in thebeginning of his stay. He was started on lisinopril which wasuptitrated to 5mg and also lopressor.Rhtyhm-He had no evidence of arrythmias.5 ) Endocrine-Mr. Rovella has DM which was diagnosed at age 23. Itis unclear if he has type I or II as he reported that he was toldhe has Type I , but had a three year stint after diagnosis wherehe was not on insulin. His FS on admission were elevated , likelysecondary to his infection and his lantus was uptitrated. He wasalso started on prandial coverage. Prior to discharge , he was hishome dose of Lantus as well as Aspart with meals. He reportedthat he already has an outpatient endocrinologist with whom hewill follow up. An HgA1c was 8.4.6 ) Pain-Mr. Vanhee had significant post operative pain whichseemed to be mostly phantom limb pain. The acute pain service wasconsulted and he was initially placed on a ketamine drip andFentanyl PCA. His fentanyl PCA and ketamine drip werediscontinued and he was started on oxycontin 80mg tid withoxycodone for breakthrough pain. He was also started on Lyricafor neuropathic pain. He was comfortable prior to discharge onthis current regimen. As his pain improves , he pain regimenshould be decreased.7 ) Psychiatry-After learning that he would likely receive atransplant from his sister , Mr. Potvin reports that he has hadsignificant anxiety prior to going for dialysis. Psychiatryservice was consulted who recommended low dose Ativan prior tohim going to dialysis.DISCHARGE EXAM:Gen: pleasant , well appearing gentleman , in NADVS: Tmax: 98.5 Tc: 97.6 BP 122-144 /70-80 P 74-84 R 18 95%on RAPulm: CTA bilaterally , no rales/wheezesCV: RRR , II/VI SEM at LSB , normal S1/S2Abd: obese , soft , NT , NABS , no HSMExt: L residual limb with dressing that is clean/dry/intactLABS ON DAY OF DISCHARGE:( prior to dialysis ) Na 136 , K 4.5 , Cr 6.0 , WBC 7.6 , Hct 28.6 , INR1.8 , PTT 103TO DO:-dry sterile dressing changes to L residual limb daily; ifevidence of erythema , drainage , please contact Dr. Mcclain ???soffice at 323-734-0631-check PTT on admission to rehabilitation with goal PTT 60-80;can d/c heparin once INR therapeutic at2-3-daily INR until stable at goal 2-3 off of levofloxacin; willlikely need to titrate coumadin-monitor FS and adjust DM regimen as needed-monitor pain scale and decrease pain medications as painimproves-hemodialysis M/W/FFOLLOW UP:-Dr. Carpino voice message was left on his medical assistant???svoice mail at 323-734-0631 to contact pt???s parents to arrangefollow up appt in 7-10 days for wound check-Dr. Lynes 2/23/06 at 9:30ameScription document: 5-8336937 CSSten TelDictated By: AGTARAP , GUADALUPEAttending: CARMIN , MARLINDictation ID 3872938D: 1/18/06T: 1/18/06

Atrial flutter. 2. Congestive heartfailure.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old male witha history of congestive heart failureand history of atrial flutter in September of 1998. The patient wasadmitted to Cardiology for treatment of atrial flutter andworsening congestive heart failure. The patient initiallypresented to Aler Hospital in September of 1998 withacute shortness of breath and atrial flutter. Chest x-ray at thattime showed congestive heart failure. The patient was initiallyrate controlled with Verapamil and Digoxin and converted to normalsinus rhythm. However , on Digoxin , the patient developedjunctional tachycardia , which reverted back to normal sinus rhythmafter Digoxin was discontinued. Echocardiogram at that time showedan ejection fraction of 35%. The patient was discharged on 11 of Mayin normal sinus rhythm. The patient was discharged on Lopressor ,Verapamil , Aspirin , and Coumadin , which was stopped five monthsago. The patient did extremely well after discharge until aboutfive days ago when he ran out of his Atenolol , which he had nottaken since then. Over the past week , the patient had extremefatigue and dyspnea on exertion , which steadily worsened. Today ,the patient was taking out the trash and experienced a few secondsof chest heaviness on the left side , without any radiation. Thepatient reported being short of breath , but had no other symptoms.Upon trying to the mailbox , the patient was extremely short ofbreath and fell to the ground , but had no loss of consciousness.There was no warning or dizziness. The patient was brought toTien Medical Center Emergency Department. There , the patient wasnoted to be in atrial flutter at a rate of 150. The patient wasgiven IV Lopressor , 5 mg , and his heart rate came down to 106.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A review of systems was positive for threepillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and increasinglower extremity swelling over the past week. The patient deniedany fever , chills , night sweats , or change in bowel movements.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history was significant forhigh blood pressure , left ankle and left knee arthritis ,questionable history of gout , gonococcal urethritis ,diverticulosis , elevated cholesterol , and cardiomyopathy withejection fraction of 35% by echocardiogram in September of 1998.ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONSON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient was onSimvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day ,Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , which the patient self discontinuedfive days prior to admission , Lisinopril 20 mg q. day , Aspirin ,B12 , Folate , and Multivitamins. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient'ssocial history was significant for tobacco , one pack per day forforty years. The patient quit in February of 1998. Alcohol wassignificant for two to three drinks per day , with none sinceSeptember of 1998. There was no history of drug use. The patientlives in Derdflintvo alone. The patient is a retired social worker.FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's family history was significant for amother with a myocardial infarction at 60 , brother with myocardialinfarction at 54 , and father who is deceased from cerebrovascularaccident.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient wasafebrile. The heart rate was 115 , bloodpressure 150/100 , and saturation 95% on 2 liters. In general , thepatient was alert and oriented and in no acute distress. HEENTrevealed the patient to be normocephalic , atraumatic. The pupilswere equal , round and reactive to light. The extraocular movementswere intact. The oropharynx was moist. The neck was supplewithout bruits. The chest was clear to auscultation.Cardiovascular examination revealed a 1/6 holosystolic murmur. Thepatient was in atrial flutter. The abdominal examination wasbenign. The extremities showed 1+ edema bilaterally. There was noclubbing or cyanosis. Electrocardiogram on admission showed atrialflutter at rate of 50 , as well as left axis deviation , right bundlebranch block , left ventricular hypertrophy with QRS widening , oldinferior myocardial infarction , and right bundle branch block.Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion ,consistent with congestive heart failure , and bilateral pleuraleffusions.LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission showed sodium 146 ,potassium 4.4 , creatinine 1.2 , white blood cellcount 6.7 , hematocrit 42.5 , CK 95 , and troponin 0.05.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology floorfor treatment of atrial flutter and congestiveheart failure. The patient was ruled out for myocardialinfarction. It was felt that the patient's worsening congestiveheart failure was likely secondary to his flutter. The patient wasstarted on Lasix in addition to being started on a beta blocker.However , the patient remained in atrial flutter with poor ratecontrol. Echocardiogram on 7 of September showed an ejection fraction of30-35% with global hypokinesis. Of note , also , the patient'sventricular myocardium showed an echo bright appearance consistentwith possible infiltrative disease. On 14 of October , the patientunderwent cardioversion without complications , as he was still inatrial flutter and was not having good rate control. The patientwas successfully cardioverted and remained in sinus rhythmafterwards. However , on 23 of May , the patient was still significantlyshort of breath and hypoxic. This was felt probably likelysecondary to fluid overload , and the patient was started on Lasix.However , the patient underwent a VQ scan and was ruled out forpulmonary embolism. The patient did well and , on 6 of April , the patientexperienced bilateral lip swelling , consistent with angioedema.The patient's Lasix and Captopril were discontinued , as it wasunclear which agent had caused this , however , it was most likelythe Captopril. This responded well to Benadryl. The patient wasstarted on ethacrynic acid and Hydralazine for diuresis andafterload reduction. The patient did well on this regimen. On26 of February , the patient was discharged home in stable condition. Thepatient was in sinus rhythm and was satting well on room air.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patientwas on Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mginhaled q. 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing , Enteric coated aspirin325 mg p.o. q. day , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day , Edecrin 25 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day , Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,Simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q. day , andBenadryl 50 mg p.o. q. 6 hours as needed for lip swelling.FOLLOW-UP: The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr. Kotowin one week.

Dentition is without evidence of infection.Chest is free of incisions. Cardiovascular: Regular rate andrhythm. There are no murmurs. Pulses: Carotid , radial ,femoral , dorsalis pedis , and posterior tibialis pulses are all 2+bilaterally. Allen's test in the left upper extremity was normalwith using a pulse oximeter. Respiratory: The patient has clearbreath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen: There are no incisions.Abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended with normoactivebowel sounds. Extremities: Are free of scarring , varicositiesor edema. Neurologic: The patient is alert and oriented. Hehas no focal deficits.LABS UPON ADMISSION: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 105 ,bicarbonate 28 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 178 , magnesium 2 ,white count 8 , hematocrit 38.5 , hemoglobin 13.6 , platelets 163 ,PT 16 , INR 1.3 , PTT 34.9. Urinalysis is normal. Cardiaccatheterization done on 8/28/04 revealed a 90% ostial LADlesion , 70% ostial ramus , 90% mid D1 , 80% ostial D3 , 75% proximalcircumflex , 50% ostial RCA , 90% proximal PDA. There was rightdominant circulation and 75%-80% right renal artery stenosis. Hehad an ejection fraction of approximately 60%.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to hospital on4/25/04 and was taken to the operating room on 10/19/04 where hereceived a five-vessel CABG in which the left internal mammaryartery was sewn to the LAD. Saphenous vein graft 1 to firstdiagonal artery. Right internal mammary artery was sewn to theramus. The left radial artery was harvested and sewn to LVB2 andLVB1. Bypass time was 159 minutes. Cross clamp time 111minutes. Postoperatively , he was taken to the cardiac intensivecare unit where he was hemodynamically stable. He was rapidlyweaned of the ventilator without problems. He did develop a boutof rapid atrial fibrillation in the first two dayspostoperatively. This was treated by restarting the patient'spropafenone , which he was taken preoperatively for atrialfibrillation. The patient's other primary issue postoperativelywhile in the intensive care unit was an episode of oliguria , nearanuria. A renal consult was obtained at this time. He didreceive a bilateral renal ultrasound , which showed kidneys to beessentially equal in size with no hydronephrosis. He was startedon low-dose dopamine and once his systolic pressure went back tohis baseline preoperative systolic pressure of approximately 160 ,he began to make adequate amounts of urine. It was thereforedetermined that his renal perfusion is largely pressure dependentwith him requiring a mean pressure of close to 100. He remainedhemodynamically stable. He did have some constipation , which wastreated with an aggressive bowel regimen and subsequentlyresolved. He will be transferred out to the cardiac step-downunit on 9/7/04.The remainder of this discharge summary will be dictated at thetime of discharge.eScription document: 7-1741956 ISSten TelDictated By: KONYE , JORGEAttending: MAGG , RANDY CAREYDictation ID 7216473D: 6/14/04T: 6/14/04

He had apast medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recentcomplex medical history including a septic right knee arthritiswith MRSA complicated by a PICC line-induced right upper extremityDVT followed by bacteremia with multi-resistant Klebsiellapneumoniae , treated with meropenem for 14 days with the courseending on 11/11/2006. The patient presented with left lower quadrant abdominalpain during his last admission 2 weeks ago associated with low-volume mucusdiarrhea , C. diff toxin assay was at that time negative on 1/24Abdominal CT showed diverticulosis with stranding of the sigmoid colon.Blood cultures grew klebsiella , treated with 14 days of meropenemas previously noted. However , since this discharge , the mildabdominal pain persisted. He continues to have low-grade mucusdiarrhea about 5 times a day , not associated with fever , chillsor anorexia. Over the last 2 days prior to this admission , thediarrhea became high volume , still nonbloody and not associatedagain with fever or chills. He was brought into the emergencydepartment at which time , he was afebrile with a blood pressureof 85/49 , heart rate in the 80s , respiratory rate of 20 , O2saturation 93% on room air. At that time , he received volumeresuscitation with 2 liters of IV fluids , stool samples for C.diff assay were sent. He received empiric therapy with p.o.vancomycin. An abdominal CT in the emergency department showedthickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes coronary artery disease as notedwith an anterior MI in 2003 , that had complicated to VT arrest ,status post CABG in 2003 that was a left internal mammary arteryto LAD with saphenous vein graft to the PTA and obtuse marginal.He has had a catheterization in 3/12 that showed patent graftsand drug-eluting stent to the left circumflex. He has chronickidney disease , baseline creatinine between 1.3 and 1.5 ,hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , C. diff colitis in 2003 , BPH ,asthma , GERD , status post right upper extremity PICC-related DVTand right knee septic arthritis.MEDICATIONS: aspirin 81 mg , Plavix 75 mg , Coumadin 5 mg , digoxin 0.125 mg ,Lasix 49 mg daily , lisinopril 10 mg daily , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 80 mgdaily , Flomax 0.4 mg daily and Flovent 110 mcg b.i.d.ALLERGIES: penicillin which caused hives and swelling.SOCIAL HISTORY: He previously a smoker. He does not drink. Heis a nursing home resident.FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease , twobrothers who had coronary artery disease in their 60s. No familyhistory of cancer.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals as previous noted , blood pressurein the 80s/49 , heart rate 80 , regular , respiratory rate 20 , O2saturation 93% on room air. Patient was afebrile. Pertinentphysical findings included: Pulmonary: He had a prolongedexpiratory phase , but no crackles. Cardiovascular: Distant heartsounds , regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No rubs orgallops. Systolic ejection or murmur 3/6 at the left lowersternal border. Abdomen: Obese , distended abdomen , left lowerquadrant tenderness to palpation. No rebound at this time.Extremities are warm , 2+ pulses with 1+ bilateral lower extremityedema to the shins. Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3 , cranialnerves grossly intact , no abnormalities.admission abdominal CT showed bowel wall thickening inthe descending sigmoid colon and rectum. Chest x-ray showedleft-sided pleural effusion , atelectasis in the left lower lobe.LABORATORY DATA: Labs were significant for a white count of15.7 , hematocrit of 35.5 and INR of 3.2. Electrolytes werenormal.Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for hypertension andinfectious etiology. He was stabilized there and transferred tothe floor within a few days.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Colitis , presumed infectious etiology , descending and sigmoidcolon. Colitis was worse over the last month , associated withdiarrhea. Abdominal CT is consistent with an infectiousinflammatory bowel process. Given history of C. diff colitis , C.diff was the most likely infectious etiology , but others werepossible. Ischemic colitis was considered secondary to lowforward flow , given patient's cardiomyopathy and low ejectionfraction of 20% to 35% and he also got a pattern of inflammatorycolitis or nonspecific colitis. Stool samples were sent for a C.diff toxin and assay and all were negative x at least 3 samples.Stool cultures were sent and did not grow anything out duringadmission. Empiric treatment was started with p.o. vancomycin.Patient's abdominal pain continued to improve and completelyresolved. By discharge , patient remained afebrile and whiteblood cell count decreased. Advance patient's diet as toleratedand by discharge the patient was up to soft solids. We addedlactobacillus p.o. for probiotics and patient also had flex sigtwo days before discharge , showing resolving inflammationconsistent with colitis of inflammatory etiology. The flex sigdid not change his management. We did discharge the patient on a2-week course p.o. vancomycin alone.2. Coronary artery disease. Patient had no evidence for acutecoronary syndrome on admission. We continued his aspirin ,Plavix , statin and beta-blocker. Patient had no ischemic issuesor coronary artery disease issues during his admission.3. CHF. Patient has previous EF noted at 20% to 35% , so agentle hydration therapy at first in the MICU for hypertensionand then as patient's blood pressure increased , was able torestart patient's Lasix dose in order to diurese all of the extrafluid gained during the rehydration therapy , was restarted on theLasix 40 mg p.o. daily , his daily dose at home. Also consideredrestarting lisinopril , but deferred discharge to outpatientfollow up with primary care physician for restart of lisinopril ,once patient is fully recovered.4. Chronic kidney disease. Patient had a baseline of creatinine1.2 to 1.5 and he came into the hospital with a creatinine of 1.0.The patient was below baseline and remained below baseline duringadmission. He did not have any renal issues.5. Hematology. Patient has a history a line-induced DVT , hasbeen treated with Coumadin , with no definitive evidence as to howalong patient should be treated , given that the DVT was lineinduced. Coumadin was therapeutic on admission , becamesupertherapeutic in the MICU. Held Coumadin until INR fell below3 , restarted Coumadin afterwards at 6 mg p.o. daily , patient'snormal dose. Patient was therapeutic on discharge. Will followup with primary care physician for Coumadin monitoring.6. Nutrition. Patient was in the MICU and was n.p.o. givenabdominal pain and colitis. When transferred to floor , wasstarted on liquid diet and advanced to soft solid diet. Bydischarge , the patient did not have abdominal pain and most ofthe diarrhea had resolved.PROCEDURES PERFORMED: The patient had a flexible sigmoidoscopyduring the admission that showed colitis consistent withinflammatory etiology.DIAGNOSIS: Patient had repeated negative C. diff toxin assays ,but colitis was presumed to be C. diff and given history , couldhave been other infectious or inflammatory etiologies. Patientcontinued to improve on vancomycin and thus was discharged withpresumed C. diff colitis diagnosis.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Included aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , Plavix75 mg p.o. daily , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily , Nexium 20 mg p.o.daily , Flovent 110 mcg inhale b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily ,lactobacillus 2 tabs p.o. t.i.d. , metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,simvastatin 80 mg p.o. at bed time , Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. everyevening , vancomycin 250 mg p.o. every 6 hours x8 days atdischarge and Coumadin 5 mg p.o. every evening.Patient had to follow up with primary care physician , setup for 2to 3 weeks after discharge.eScription document: 3-2394135 HFFocusDictated By: SOLLOCK , SHELTONAttending: VALLEJOS , JAIME TERRANCEDictation ID 6308102D: 10/27/06T: 4/24/06

SOCIAL HISTORY revealedthe patient lives with his wife , he is an exposed smoker andoccasional ethanol drinker. He is retired secondary to hiscardiomyopathy. He was able to ambulate and play golf prior to thecoronary artery bypass grafting in October .PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was uncomfortable , tachypneic.Vital signs were temperature 100.7 , heartrate 97 , blood pressure 108/67 , 96% oxygen saturation on 4 litersby nasal cannula. Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examinationshowed extraocular movements were intact , pupils equal , round ,reactive to light , oropharynx benign. Neck was supple with nolymphadenopathy. Chest showed left base bronchial breath soundswith egophony , with a few scattered wheezes throughout.Cardiovascular examination showed JVP approximately 8 centimeters ,carotids were I+ bilaterally , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm ,S1 , S2 , very distant heart sounds. The liver edge was palpable.Abdomen was nontender , positive bowel sounds. Skin showed theupper chest wound where debridement had taken place , approximately6 centimeters long at the incisional site , which was slightlytender and erythematous. Back showed no costovertebral angletenderness. Extremities showed the patient had TEDS stockings on ,there was trace edema , II+ pulses bilaterally. Neurologicexamination showed the patient was alert and oriented , fluent , andthe examination was nonfocal.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , SMA-7 showed sodium 135 ,potassium 5.1 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate22 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 128. CK was 13 , triponin 0.0.Prothrombin time was 14.1 , partial thromboplastin time 27.5.Digoxin level was 0.6. Complete blood count showed white bloodcount 7.8 , differential 69 neutrophils , 16 lymphs , 7 monos , 8eosinophils , hematocrit 28.7 , platelets 735 , 000. Sputum from27 of January showed 4+ Hemophilus influenza , which was pan sensitive.Chest x-ray on the date of admission showed a left lower lobeinfiltrate with possible effusion. Electrocardiogram showed leftbundle branch block. VQ scan was low probability.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Infectious disease. The patient had amaximum temperature of 102.3 on 27 of February He wason vancomycin , gentamicin and ceftazidime. On 13 of June , gentamicinand ceftazidime were discontinued , and ofloxacin was startedsecondary to decreasing creatinine. After his temperature spike on21 of August , the patient's maximum temperature declined each of thefollowing days , and he has remained afebrile the last 2 days. Thesternal wound appeared less erythematous , and he was continued onvancomycin for the coagulase negative Staphylococcus that grew fromthe wound site on 15 of May The patient had a computerizedtomography scan of his chest to rule out an abscess at the sternalwound site and no abscess was seen. Thoracentesis was done on theleft pleural effusion , and the tap was an exudate with pH 7.51 ,glucose 114 , total protein 4.9 , amylase 16 , LDH 38. There were 756white blood cells on differential , of which 93% macrophages and 7%mesothelioma cells , 127 , 000 red blood cells , and the fluid wasgrossly blood. Cultures from the fluid were negative for bacteriaand fungal growth. Gram stain showed no organisms , nopolymorphonuclear cells. Vancomycin was redosed to 1 gram every 48hours secondary to increased creatinine and elevated levels. Givenhis recent requirement for debridement , vancomycin will becontinued for 2 weeks after discharge. Ofloxacin will also becontinued for the same. All cultures from this hospitalization arenegative to date.2. Cardiovascular. The patient ruled out for myocardialinfarction. VQ scan was low probability on admission. This wasperformed secondary to his baseline tachycardia. Lower extremitynoninvasive studies and ultrasound were done and were negative fordeep vein thrombosis. The patient's triponin on admission was 0.0.The patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initialdyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestiveheart failure. His admission weight was 100.6 kilograms , andweight on discharge was 95.8 kilograms. With aggressive diuresisduring hospitalization , Lasix was discontinued on the day prior todischarge. Digoxin level on admission was 0.6 , on discharge was1.0. The patient had several episodes of hypotension with systolicblood pressure in the mid 70's to low 80's. Captopril andLopressor were decreased and held at certain stages during hishospitalization. On discharge , he was on a stable dose ofCaptopril , 6.25 milligrams 3 times a day , and Lopressor , 12.5milligrams twice a day. He was not orthostatic on the day prior todischarge.3. Renal. The patient was aggressively diuresed. His BUN andcreatinine rose from 12 and 1.2 on admission , to a peak of 36 and2.6 on 20 of November Subsequently , the creatinine has declined , and on9 of July , BUN was 37 , creatinine 2.2. The patient had aneosinophilia , which peaked at 18% on 16 of March , and subsequentlydecreased to 11% on discharge. Urine eosinophils were not present.It appeared that his eosinophilia was related to ceftazidime , whichwas discontinued on 24 of January It is unlikely that his increasingrenal insufficiency is secondary to acute tubular necrosis. Morelikely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken todecrease his congestive heart failure. Follow-up laboratory valueswill likely reveal improvement in BUN and creatinine status , aswell as a decrease in his peripheral eosinophilia.4. Psychiatry. The patient has had anxiety , especially at night ,and has been treated successfully with Ativan , but Serax resultedin nightmares. The patient has a history of depression and maybenefit from counseling. The patient's decreased oral intake ,nightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlyingdepressive component over his prolonged illness.5. Endocrine. The patient's blood sugar levels have been wellcontrolled on a regimen of NPH , 20 each morning. He has notrequired any additional coverage , and regular insulin coverage hasbeen discontinued for 2 days.DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is fair. MEDICATIONS ONDISCHARGE are Tylenol , 650 milligrams by mouth every4 hours as needed for headache , enteric-coated aspirin , 325milligrams by mouth each day , Captopril , 6.25 milligrams by mouthevery 8 hours , held if systolic blood pressure is less than 85 ,digoxin , 0.125 milligrams by mouth each day , Benadryl , 25 to 50milligrams by mouth every 4 hours as needed for itching , Colace ,100 milligrams by mouth twice a day , NPH insulin , 20 unitssubcutaneously each morning , Atrovent inhaler , 2 puffs 4 times aday , Ativan , 0.5 to 1 milligram by mouth every 6 hours as neededfor anxiety and insomnia , Lopressor , 12.5 milligrams by mouth twicea day , held for systolic blood pressure less than 80 or heart rateless than 60 , Niferex , 150 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,Percocet , 1 or 2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain ,Sarna lotion topically to back as needed , vancomycin , 1 gramintravenously every 48 hours times 10 days , Axid , 150 milligrams bymouth twice a day , ofloxacin , 200 milligrams by mouth twice a daytimes 7 days.The patient will be transferred to Manhill County Hospitalon 5 of September He will have a FOLLOW-UP appointment with Dr. Andaverdein approximately 2 weeks.Dictated By: LAWRENCE SAWALLICH , M.D. AU1Attending: CHARLES G.

Chest x-ray on1/28/05 consistent with congestive heart failure.Brachiocephalic and right subclavian stents were in place.HOSPITAL COURSEBRIEF OPERATIVE NOTE:Date of surgery , 2/18/05.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:See magna valve three months prior. EPL on echo showed grosslymobile on the stable aortic valve prosthesis moderate , MR. Novegetations.PROCEDURE:Reoperation of ascending aortic dissection , aortic valvereplacement , #24 homograph , MVP with Alfieri suture.BYPASS TIME:355 minutes ,CROSSCLAMP TIME:265 minutes.One ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternaltube , two left pleural tubes and two right pleural tubes wereplaced.FINDINGS:Dense inflammatory edematous scar tissue throughout pericardium ,especially periaortic. Right axillary cannulation with 6 mmHemashield side. Percutaneous right CF decannulation.Uneventful re-sternotomy.Previous SVG PDA injured during dissection , repaired withinterrupted 7-0 Prolene. Aortic valve prosthesis dehisced 3/4 ofcircumference with question of an abscess cavity near LCC/RCCjunction. Debridement , the annulus is of extensive inflammatorytissue. Previous Dacron aortic root patch removed due to pocketof pus on the anterior aspect. No. 24 allograft placed withdouble layer proximal suture line. SVG and both coronaryarteries implanted as buttons. Distal suture line continuous 4-0Prolene. Transaortic and mitral valves replaced.After the operation , the patient was transferred to the cardiacintensive care unit in stable condition. His postoperativecourse was complicated by the following:1. Infectious disease: Although , Mr. Ownbey had multiple bloodcultures , sent , they all proved to be negative as of the date ofdischarge. Although Mr. Cavitt was never felt to be bacteremic ,the cultures that were sent from the operating room were of theaortic valve prosthesis. This never showed the organismsidentified on Gram stain and MSSA stain. However , the infectiousdisease physicians were consulted and felt that Mr. Sanjurjo shouldbe on vancomycin , rifampin , and gentamicin. As at the time ofdischarge , Mr. Bersamin has finished his regimen of gentamicin andwill continue to be on both vancomycin and rifampin until11/12/04. The rifampin he will take orally and the vancomycin hewill get after dialysis three times a week. While an inpatient ,Mr. Rakus never had any evidence of leukocytosis or bacteremia.2. Cardiovascular: Ms. Johe was noted to have a first-degreeAV block on postoperative day #7 with a PR interval of 0.35. Upinto this point he had been receiving labetalol. This was heldand the electrophysiology consult was obtained. Theelectrophysiology service saw the patient agreed to be anexcellent candidate for permanent pacemaker. Initially theyattempted to gain access to the right brachiocephalic/subclavian.However , this proved to be difficult and ultimately obtainaccess through the left iliac. His permanent pacemaker wasplaced on 10/3/05 and was interrogated the following day andfelt to be functioning appropriately. He was restarted on hislabetalol and as of the time of discharge , has had no symptoms.Other than the above , Ms. Dingman was weaned from his oxygenrequirement , mobilized rapidly following surgery. All epicardialpacing wires and chest tubes were removed without complication.He will be discharged home on the following medications aspirin325 mg p.o. daily , hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , labetalol100mg p.o. t.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg p.o.6 hours p.r.n. pain , rifampin 300 mg p.o. q.8h. , vancomycin forwhich he will receive following dialysis until 2/28/05 , Zocor 40mg p.o. q.h.s. , losartan 100 mg p.o. daily. Mr. Llanez willfollow up with Dr. Owston , cardiac surgeon , in six weeks , and Dr.Geister , cardiologist , in three to four weeks , Dr. Kmiecik , thepatient's primary care physician , in one to two weeks and Dr.Vaught , cardiologist , in two weeks.eScription document: 3-1385359 EMSSten TelDictated By: ORTMAN , HUMBERTOAttending: ANENE , WARREN NICKDictation ID 3675694D: 11/8/05T: 11/8/05

The patient wasrecently admitted to Tapo Waycent Smouthnew Community Hospital in earlyOctober with a congestive heart failure exacerbation and lowerextremity cellulitis. She was treated with diuresis ( ultimatelywith ethacrynic acid as she developed a rash on torsemide anditching with Lasix ) and a seven-day course of levofloxacin. Atthe end of this admission , she was sent to a rehabilitationfacility. The patient had returned on the day of admission tosee her primary care physician. She had been vomiting andappears severely dehydrated. She reported nausea and vomitingfor eight to nine days , intermittent nonbloody , nonbilious. Shealso reported dysphagia for the last two months. She describesrecent dysuria. She also states that she has had no bowelmovement for a week prior to admission. She has had flatus. Shealso complains of a baseline right ear pain due to herpostherpetic neuralgia. She has significantly decreased p.o.intake with increasing generalized weakness. She denies chestpain or shortness of breath.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Congestive heart failure ,hypercholesterolemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , venousstasis , T6 fracture and lower back pain , history of herpes zosterwith postherpetic neuralgia affecting the right face and ear ,atrial fibrillation status post pace replacement , and history ofguaiac-positive stools.MEDICATIONS: Colace , senna , lisinopril 5 mg q. day , Lopressor 25mg b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain , OxyContin 10 mgq.12h. , calcium 500 mg t.i.d. , Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d. , Fosamax70 mg q. week , Protonix 40 mg q. day , and ethacrynic acid 25 mgb.i.d.ALLERGIES: Lasix , torsemide , penicillin , erythromycin , capsicum ,and quinidine.SOCIAL HISTORY: Recently at the Orva Sonapa Alblands inME , otherwise , lives alone in Rham En Ma At baseline isambulatory with a walker. Remote history of tobacco , quit 50years ago. No history of alcohol use.FAMILY HISTORY: Asthma and heart disease in three brothers.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 96 , heart rate81 , blood pressure 119/56 , respiratory rate of 20 , O2 sat 99% onroom air. The patient is alert , but uncomfortable and illappearing. HEENT: Pupils equal and reactive to light.Extraocular movements intact. Mucous membranes are dry.Oropharynx is otherwise clear. There is ptosis of the right lid( baseline ) and exquisite tenderness over the right base and rightear. Neck: JVP is 7 cm. Neck is otherwise supple with notenderness to palpation. Cardiovascular: Regular rate andrhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Lungs are clearto auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,nondistended with normal active bowel sounds. Foley in placedraining a dark , cloudy urine. Extremities: Violaceous skinchanges of the legs bilaterally. 2+ edema. There is an area oferythema in the left medial great toe , but no evidence ofinfected ulceration. Neuro: Alert and oriented x3. Cranialnerves intact ( except right lid ptosis ). The patient did notfeel well enough to cooperate with a full neurologic exam , buther strength was symmetric throughout.LABS ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for a chemistry panel withinnormal limits. BUN was 22 , creatinine 1.1 , white count was13.27 , hematocrit 41.4 , platelets 448 , 000 , ALT 25 , AST 35 ,alkaline phosphatase 339 , total bilirubin 1.0 , albumin 4.0 ,amylase 39 , and lipase 14.IMPRESSION: An 87-year-old female presenting with nausea ,vomiting , and dehydration as well as dysuria , most likely mainlydue to urinary tract infection secondary to chronic Foleyplacement.HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:1. Cardiovascular:a. Ischemia: No acute issues. The patient was continued on herbeta-blocker. No aspirin was given , as the patient is onCoumadin and has a history of guaiac-positive stool.b. Pump: The patient was dry on admission in the setting ofnausea , vomiting , and decreased p.o. intake. Her last echoshowed an EF of 55% presumed diastolic dysfunction ,mild-to-moderate MR as well as pulmonary hypertension of unclearetiology ( pulmonary artery pressure was 64 mmHg plus right atrialpressure ). Initially , the patient's ethacrynic acid was heldgiven dehydration , but was restarted towards the end of heradmission and titrated out to b.i.d. dosing to maintain aslightly negative fluid balance. The patient was also continuedon her beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor after she was adequatelyhydrated for blood pressure control.c. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrialfibrillation. She has a pacer placed and is V-paced. She is onCoumadin with her INR at goal.2. Pulmonary: The admission chest x-ray was read as a streakyopacity of the right lung base possibly representing aninfiltrate , but curve has been artifact due to low lung volume.The patient had no clinical evidence of pneumonia ( no cough , lungexam clear ).3. GI: The patient had nausea , vomiting for several days priorto admission with decreased p.o. intake. She also reported nobowel movement in the last weeks prior to admission. A KUB wasobtained on admission , which showed no evidence of obstruction orfree air. The patient was given stool softeners and laxativesp.r.n. and began to have her regular bowel movements. She wascontinued on Nexium for her history of gastroesophageal refluxdisease. The patient's nausea and vomiting improved overallthroughout her admission , however , intermittently returned.There is no clear cause for this nausea and vomiting , but it wasthought likely to be a contribution of her opioid medications ,which were increased early on in her hospitalization to addressher postherpetic neuralgia. The patient's nausea improved withReglan. Nausea , vomiting was improved on the day of discharge.The patient had significantly better p.o. intake. The patientalso complained of dysphagia for two months prior to admission ,this occurred mainly with solid foods. Per Speech and Swallow ,the patient was initially on a soft mechanical/thin liquid dietand is concerned for an obstructive lesion. A video swallow wasobtained on 3/4/05. This study showed no aspiration and normalpassage of fluid of varying consistencies ( although a note wasmade of cricopharyngeal prominence ). Speech and Swallowrecommended a minced solid/thin liquid diet , which the patienthas tolerated well. The patient has a history of an elevatedalkaline phosphatase ( with elevated GGT ) of unclear etiology.Abdominal ultrasound on her last admission in October 2005showed gallstones , but no other process to explain theabnormalities in alkaline phosphatase. The patient had no rightupper quadrant pain on this admission.4. Renal/FEN: The patient was initially given intravenousfluids for dehydration. She was also found to have a urinarytract infection and was initially started on levofloxacinempirically. The urine culture returned was Staph aureus ( thepatient has had indwelling Foley ) and the patient was switched todoxycycline ( the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs , penicillin ,and erythromycin ). Blood cultures were negative. The patienthas been afebrile through this admission. She was also noted tohave a urinary retention on a few occasions where an attempt wasmade to remove her Foley catheter. This was thought most likelydue to urinary tract infection and to use opioid medications.The patient will be discharged to rehab with her Foley in placeand is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Urology onOctober , 2005.5. Neuro: The patient has postherpetic neuralgia affecting herright face/ear. She was admitted on OxyContin and oxycodone ,which was titrated out in an attempt to make her more comfortableand Neurontin was also titrated out with good effect on her pain.Given her nausea and urinary retention , the patient's opioidmedications were decreased. A trial of a lidoderm patch on theaffected area was attempted prior to discharge.6. Heme: The patient's INR was at goal ( 2 to 3 ) on Coumadin forher history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.7. Prophylaxis: The patient was on Nexium and Coumadin.8. Code status: DNR/DNI.9. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to arehabilitation facility. She will follow up with her primarycare doctor Dr. Eddie Nitterhouse In addition , an appointment hasbeen made for her to see Dr. Nang on January , 2005 at 9:30a.m. In addition , an appointment has been made with Dr. Storchin Neurology on October , 2005 at 11:15 a.m. and it is requestedthat the patient's basic metabolic panel be monitored while sheis on ethacrynic acid. In addition , her weight should befollowed daily to check for fluid accumulation. She will alsobenefit from physical therapy as she is deconditioned. Thepatient is stable at the time of this dictation.The discharge medications will be dictated in an addendum to thisdischarge summary.eScription document: 5-4891603 ISSten TelCC: Jerry Stammler M.D.IJELOS MEMORIAL HOSPITALTerSan Longgao BaltCC: Levi Jackie Corderman M.D.Dictated By: HOVDA , GARTHAttending: QUIMET , HAROLD DANDictation ID 3046159D: 10/9/05T: 1/27/05

A leftlower extremity ultrasound obtained at that time revealed a fluidcollection along the prior SVG tract , corresponding to the area withthe most significant erythema. Mr. Tixier was continued onvancomycin and levofloxacin and was taken back to the operatingroom on 9/6/06 for drainage and irrigation of left lower extremityendoscopic saphenous vein harvest site. No obvious purulence was notedin the operating room. Cultures were sent from the OR whichsubsequently revealed no growth. Postoperatively , the wound waspacked with wet-to-dry dressing , changed daily , and the patientwas continued on vancomycin IV antibiotics with white blood cellcount improving. Following operative reintervention , SVG harvestsite incision appeared less inflamed , less tender and less erythematous ,with corresponding improvement in cellulitis. A plan had been made tosubsequently discharge the patient on postoperative day #13 , 5/2/06.A long line was placed at this time in anticipation of discharge forcontinuation of seven days of IV vancomycin. However , white bloodcount rose to 19.4 on planned day of discharge , 3/28/06 , and ,althought the patient remained afebrile and the wound continued toremain clean with minimal cellulitis , Mr. Obanion was kept inpatientovernight for continued observation and re-assessment of WBC. On3/25/06 , white blood cell count improved to 14.3 , the patientremained afebrile , and the wound continued to remain clean withpacking changed wet-to-dry daily. Additional sources of leukocytosiswere sought including sputum culture , which subsequently demonstratedno significant growth. Urinalysis was noted to be mildly dirty , forwhich the patient began a short course of p.o. levofloxacin.Sternal wound continued to remain intact with no sternal click ,erythema , or drainage noted.

General: Morbidly obese , speaking in fullsentences. HEENT: Oropharynx clear , anicteric sclerae. Neck:JVP less than 6 cm though difficult to assess secondary tohabitus. No lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular: RRR , no MRG , noS3 or S4 appreciated. Lungs: Increased crackles at the bases.Abdomen: Obese , no obvious liver edge , no fluid wave.Extremities: Lower extremity edema approximately 2-3+. Skin:The patient with chronic excoriations on abdomen ( the patientreports they have been improving over the past year ) , and thepatient also with chronic ulcer/lesions throughout lower legsbilaterally. Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented x3.Motor strength someone decreased proximal leg and arms.LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 103 , CO226 , BUN 64 , creatinine 4.0 ( baseline creatinine of 3.7 - 3.9 ) ,albumin 3.4 , white count of 7.1 , hematocrit of 33.5 , platelets of137 , ( baseline hematocrit usually 32-35 ) , LFTs within normallimits ( ALT , AST , alk phos , T bili ). First set of ED enzymeswere negative. BNP elevated at 655. Ammonia elevated at 83.INR 1.2 , PTT 36.Chest x-ray revealed enlarged central pulmonary arteries whichwere suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in this patient withobstructive sleep apnea , left base subsegmental atelectasis. EKGfirst degree AV block , left axis deviation , a left ??anticular??vesicular block , no ST or T-wave changes. UA with 3+ blood ,15-20 white blood cells , trace bacterial. Of note , renalultrasound on 9/29/03 ( prior admission )I revealed nohydronephrosis , distended gallbladder with multiple small stones.ETT MIBI on 9/14/03 stress images only performed revealed smallarea of myocardial scar in mid LAD/diagonal territory withmoderate stress induced peri-infarct ischemia. Echo performed2/25/03 revealed an EF of 45-50% , positive LVH. Inferior andlateral hypokinesis.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Ischemia: The patient with a history of CAD and positiveMIBI in 10/10 The patient with no EKG changes , and also nochest pain. The patient initially continued on aspirin , betablocker and a statin. On 8/25/03 the patient with a troponinleak ( peak of .84 ) which subsequently trended down. The patientalso had had a prior troponin leak prior to the previouslydescribed MIBI. At that time cardiology was following andrecommended medical management secondary to difficulty withaggressive intervention in this patient. For this admission ,cardiology was again consulted and cardiology recommended doing arepeat MIBI to assess. The MIBI was completed on 3/28/03 andresults are pending at the time of this dictation. Again , verydifficult to perform intervention secondary to habitus.Continued aspirin , beta blocker and statin. To follow up withCardiology for further read of the MIBI test. Pump: The patientwith elevated BNP and some fluid overload. Chest x-ray asdescribed above ( also a question of small pleural effusion slowlyimproved from before ). It was felt that the patient's shortnessof breath could be secondary to increased pulmonary edema. So ,the patient's Lasix was increased to 80 mg p.o. t.i.d. ( fromb.i.d. dosing ). Prior echo is as described above , revealing anEF of 45%. The patient did have successful diuresis on theincreased Lasix dosing. On 1/24 the Lasix was lowered back tob.i.d. dosing since the patient's creatinine began to rise.Creatinine normalized to patient's baseline on 10/14 At time ofdischarge the patient is on a home regimen of Lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient with a history of VT and the patientwas continued on sotalol , and monitored on telemetry withoutalarms.2. Pulmonary: The patient with shortness of breath increasedover baseline and chest x-ray as described above. Secondary tothe elevated BNP and increased lower extremity edema , the patientwas diuresed as described above. The patient does use BiPAP atnight for obstructive sleep apnea.3. Endocrine: The patient with diabetes on insulin slidingscale and a.m. NPH. No ace inhibitor was added secondary to thesignificantly elevated creatinine. The patient's NPH wasincreased to 10 units q.a.m. secondary to elevated sugars( resulting in more improved glycemic control ).4. Renal: The patient with chronic renal insufficiency with abaseline creatinine of approximately 4. This is likely secondaryto several factors , including diabetes , effects of paraproteinassociated with monoclonal gammopathy ( obesity ). The patient wascontinued on Phoslo , Calcitriol and Epogen. The patient alsowith increased hematuria , and this was discussed with urology.Previously extensive urological workup ( including cystoscopy ) waslargely negative but were poor studies secondary to largehabitus. Urology attending was not comfortable with aggressiveintervention at this time , and thought hematuria was likelysecondary to significant BPH ( and associated engorged veins ).The patient is status post Targis procedure as described above ,and hematuria secondary to recent Foley trauma from pastadmission. The patient to follow up with urology in the future.A urine cytology was obtained and is pending at this time.5. GI: The patient with elevated ammonia levels , with normalLFTs. This has also been worked up in the past according to thepatient which resulted in no clear diagnosis. The patient is tooobese for any abdominal imaging per CT. The patient does have ahistory of multiple myeloma which could be the source of elevatedammonia , versus a hepatic source. Ammonium level was 83. Thepatient had no asterixis and had normal mentation while inhouse.The patient's medication of Lactulose was continued.6. Heme: The patient with chronic anemia as described in thelab section. The patient did have an episode of epistaxis thatsubsequently resolved , and hematuria as described above , thoughalso somewhat improved at time of discharge. Hematocrit wasstable throughout this , and there was no need for transfusion.7. Oncology: The patient with a history of IgA monoclonalgammopathy status post Cytoxan therapy. The oncologistattending , Dr. Burrows , who knows the patient felt there wasno need for additional chemo at this time. Previous Cytoxantherapy has not been significantly effective.8. Neuro: The patient also complaining of muscle weakness ,proximal muscles greater than distal muscles. A neurologyconsult was called , who felt that this was largely secondary todeconditioning and secondary to patient's multiple comorbidities ,this is not likely secondary to a myositis. No further workupwas performed.PLAN TO DO: The patient to be discharged to rehabilitation forfurther care , physical therapy and medical management.

He reported no complications fromischemic chemotherapy. At baseline he cannot bear weight on hisright leg and he devised this complicated system where he shiftshimself down the stairs to the bottom of the steps using hisupper body strength and a family member to assist him. Allduring this maneuver he felt unusually short of breath the day ofadmission and in the context of breathing heavily began to sweatand feel lightheaded and then lost consciousness temporarily.Sister was present and called EMS. On arrival to the emergencyroom , he was hypotensive and received IV normal saline as volumeresuscitations. His pressures initially were noted to be in the70s to 80s systolic and improved to 90 systolic after 4 L offluid from the emergency room. The patient was admitted forsyncope. On admission as part of the workup for syncope aninitial set of cardiac enzymes was negative.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam , the patient wasafebrile , heart rate in the 90s , blood pressure systolic 100 ,respirations 20 and O2 sat 94% on room air. Pupils were equal ,round and reactive to light. There was no cervicallymphadenopathy. JVP was not visualized due to large neck.Lungs were clear. The heart was regular. There was an S1 , S2with a loud and widened split P2 component of the second heartsound. Abdomen was soft and nontender. The right hip was tenderto palpation. The extremities had 1+ edema bilaterally.The patient was admitted with a preliminary diagnosis of syncope.HOSPITAL COURSE: The second set of cardiac enzymes was positivewith a troponin of 2. Echocardiogram the morning followingadmission showed a dilated right ventricle consistent with rightventricular strain. This was followed by a PE protocol CT scan ,which showed a large saddle embolus. The patient was treatedinitially with IV heparin , transitioned to Coumadin and then thedecision was made to try Lovenox therapy for long-termanticoagulation. Cardiac enzymes normalized. Repeatechocardiogram showed mild improvement in right heart function.eScription document: 5-2012920 CSSten TelDictated By: REFF , ELBERTAttending: HACKEL , MICAH EDDictation ID 2876863D: 1/26/06T: 1/26/06

He hadshortness of breath and diaphoresis but no nausea , vomiting ,palpitations or radiation. He returned to this bed , and the painresolved after several minutes of rest. He was without furtherepisodes until the night of admission , when walking to work he had2-3 episodes of chest tightness similar to the night before. Eachof them lasted at most 10-15 minutes. He went to the Mapark Hospital emergency ward for evaluation. He denied any painlike this previously. He denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ororthopnea but did have daily ankle swelling for the past fiveminutes and some new shortness of breath after walking 200 yardsover the past 5-6 months. He also reported two episodes of blackloose stools , one 2-3 weeks prior to admission and one on the nightof admission.

He lives in Alabama with his wife and threeof his seven adult children. He has three small grandchildren. Heworks the night shift as a fork lift operator for the post office.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a morbidly obese man in noapparent distress. Pulse 84 and bloodpressure 142/80 lying; pulse 86 and blood pressure 150/100 sitting;respirations 26; afebrile. The head was normocephalic andatraumatic. The extraocular muscles were intact; pupils equal ,round and reactive to light; conjunctivae clear. The oropharynxwas clear. The neck revealed full range of motion; no thyromegaly;no masses; unable to evaluate JVD secondary to a thick neck. Therewas no CVA or spinal tenderness. The chest was clear toauscultation and percussion; decreased breath sounds throughout;barrel chest. The cardiovascular exam revealed a nearly inaudibleS1 and S2; no murmurs audible. The abdomen was soft andprotuberant; nontender; normal bowel sounds. The extremities werewithout clubbing , cyanosis , clear edema or calf tenderness orswelling. The neuro exam was nonfocal. The rectal exam revealedblack and maroon guaiac positive stool.LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Hematocrit 37.0; white blood cell count17.2 with 75 polys , 1 band , 18 lymphs , 4monos , 2 eos; platelets 439 , 000; sodium 136; potassium 4.4;chloride 104; CO2 23; BUN 60; creatinine 2.0; glucose 168; calcium10.2; phosphate 3.8; protein 7.3; albumin 4.6; AST 37; ALT 23; LDH271; alkaline phosphatase 87; cholesterol 210; triglyceride 226;CPK 72 on admission. The chest x-ray showed fat in themediastinum , normal heart , no infiltrate or effusion. A KUB showedno obstruction or free air. A tagged red blood cell scan in the EWwas negative for bleeding source. The EKG showed a normal sinusrhythm with a rate of 90; frequent PVCs; intervals 0.15 , 0.07 and0.39; axis 40 degrees; flipped T wave in L; flat Ts in V6.HOSPITAL COURSE: #1 ) Angina. The patient was admitted with astory classic for angina. He was admitted for arule out MI protocol. His EKG remained essentially unchanged. Hewas noted to be in bigeminy and had some frequent PVCs on severalEKGs and on monitor , however , his EKG remained unchanged except forsome labile T waves in the lateral lead which changed with leadplacement. He was ruled out for an MI with CPKs which actuallywent up from a CK of 72 to a peak of 331 , but on electrophoresisthere was no MB fraction found. The bump in the CK level was feltto be secondary to multiple attempts at a central line placement inthe EW and skeletal muscle trauma. He was treated with slidingscale Nitropaste and nifedipine for blood pressure control in thehospital. An echocardiogram was done to assess left ventricularfunction which revealed no regional wall motion abnormality , someslight decrease in compliance but good LV function. An exercisetolerance test could not be completed secondary to his sciatica.On ETT he went for one minute and 44 seconds with a heart rate of81-122 , blood pressure 136/80 to 144/80. There were no ST changesnoted. There were some asymptomatic VPBs and no chest pain. Hewas discharged on Procardia XL 30 daily and given a prescriptionfor nitroglycerin and instructed on how to use this. #2 ) GIbleed. He was admitted with melena and a falling hematocrit. Ahematocrit drawn at EH in January was 48 and on admission here was37 and dropped to a low of 28. He received three units of packedred blood cells in the hospital. An endoscopy on 2/6/90 showedtwo small ulcers in the prepyloric antrum , one measuring 3 mm andthe other 5-6 mm. Both were superficial and benign appearing atthe time , and neither had stigmata of a recent bleed. Biopsieswere taken with good hemostasis. No varices or esophagitis werenoted. The GI bleed was presumed to be secondary to his ulcerdisease. He was treated during the hospitalization with an H2blocker which was to continued for 8-12 weeks after discharge. Hewas instructed to not take aspirin or nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs or to drink alcohol after discharge. Thedischarge hematocrit was approximately 35 and remained stable. #3 )Leukocytosis. He was noted to have a leukocytosis without bands onadmission. This resolved with hydration and was felt to be mostlikely secondary to stress reaction. #4 ) Sleep apnea. He wasnoted to be apneic at night by the nurses with sinus bradycardiaand sinus pauses during the apneic episodes. He had one sinuspause at seven seconds. On the third night of admission , he wasmonitored on a sat monitor overnight which noted him to desaturateto the 60% and 70% range during his apneic episodes. He waspresumed to have sleep apnea and will be worked up as an outpatientwith a sleep study per Dr. Mittleman #5 ) Renal. He had anincreased BUN and creatinine on admission. This decreased withhydration. The discharge BUN was 23 and creatinine 1.1.DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition.COMPLICATIONS: None. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:Pepcid 40 mg p.o. daily; Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. daily;nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual p.r.n. chest pain. FOLLOW UP willbe with his internist , Dr. Carbonaro , and with Dr. Mirabile in eightweeks for a repeat endoscopy and with Dr. Cirillo for a sleep study.DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. NEW ONSET ANGINA.2.

Cardiac catheterization dated 9/26/05 ,coronary anatomy right dominant circulation with normal coronaryarteries. Echocardiogram on 2/13/04 shows aortic stenosis withpeak gradient 77 mmHg , calculated valve area 0.7 cm2. Mitralstenosis with peak gradient of 7 mmHg. ECG not recorded. Chestx-ray on 10/10/05 was read as normal.HOSPITAL COURSE:Brief operative note , date of surgery 3/25/05. preoperativediagnosis , aortic stenosis. Postoperative diagnosis aorticstenosis. Procedure aortic valve replacement with a #21Carpentier-Edwards magna valve. Bypass time was 59 minutes ,cross clamp time was 48 minutes. Two atrial wires , oneventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal tubereplaced. Findings , heavily calcified trileaflet aortic valve.Weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass , she was in complete heartblock. A wires and V wires were placed. After the operation ,the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit instable condition. While in the cardiac intensive care unit , hercourse was complicated by complete heart block immediatelyfollowing surgery. At that time , she had to be paced anddeveloped a junctional rhythm in the 30s. On postoperative day#2 , she was in sinus rhythm in the 70's with occasionally pacedbeats. At that time patient was started on no nodal agents ofany kind. Also , while in the cardiac intensive care unit , it wasfound that she had a low hematocrit and was given 1 unit ofpacked red blood cells and her hematocrit has been stable since.On postoperative day 2 , the patient was transferred to thecardiac step-down unit. While on the cardiac step-down unit ,course was complicated by the following: As stated previously ,the patient was on no nodal blockers upon transfer. Shedeveloped rapid atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 3 withheart rates between 100 and 120. Because her epicardial pacingwires were functioning appropriately , it was felt that patientwould benefit from a beta-blocker. Lopressor was started and thepatient tolerated this dose of beta-blocker without anybradycardiac episodes. However , patient continued in and out ofatrial fibrillation for the next two days. On postoperative day5 , she was started on diltiazem drip. Once the drip wasimplemented , she was she converted to normal sinus rhythm. Whenthe diltiazem drip was discontinued and her beta-blocker wascontinued , the patient as of today discharge has been in normalsinus rhythm for greater than 48 hours. Of note , patient wassubtherapeutic on her INR prior to discharge. Her INR will beclosely followed by Greenau Healt Hospital anticoagulationclinic.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:She was discharged home in stable condition on the followingmedications: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. pain , aspirin 81 mgp.o. daily , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. constipation ,glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ToprolXL 150 mg p.o. daily , Advair Diskus 250/50 1 puff inhaler b.i.d. ,atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , Coumadin of which she willreceive 3 mg today.PLAN:As stated previously , patient is on Coumadin for her rapid atrialfibrillation.

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 5/14/1997 Report Status: SignedDischarge Date: 10/19/1997PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTIONHISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 36 year-old male whopresented with chest pain for oneand one-half hours. In September , 1989 , he developed chest pain andsuffered an inferior myocardial infarction. He had an angioplastyof his right coronary artery performed at that time. In April ,1989 , he had more chest pain. Cardiac catheterization indicatedleft anterior descending artery lesion. An angioplasty wasattempted and he had abrupt left anterior descending arteryclosure , requiring emergent single vessel coronary artery bypassgrafting. He did well until August , 1996 , when he had moreangina. Cardiac catheterization showed a high grade leftcircumflex lesion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastyof the left circumflex was successful. At that time , his cardiaccatheterization also showed that his saphenous vein to leftanterior descending artery graft was patent. His ejection fractionwas 68% by left ventriculogram at that time. In April , 1996 , hehad more chest pain and his cardiac catheterization showed nosignificant change compared to his August , 1996 , cardiaccatheterization. One week prior to admission , the patient hadchest pain , which was quickly relieved by one sublingualnitroglycerin. On the day of admission , while resting , hedeveloped anterior chest pressure with radiation to his neck ,associated with some lightheadedness and nausea. There was nodiaphoresis or dyspnea. He took three sublingual nitroglycerinwith minimal relief. He came to the Emergency Room and his painresolved after one inch of nitroglycerin paste , 2 milligrams ofintravenous morphine , 325 milligrams of aspirin and supplementaloxygen. The total duration of his pain was one and one-half hours.He was then admitted to the Medical Short Stay Unit.MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission were Atenolol 100milligrams b.i.d.; Cardizem 60 milligrams p.o.b.i.d.; pravastatin 20 milligrams p.o. q.d.; aspirin 325 milligramsq.d.; sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis C; hypercholesterolemia;hypertension; coronary artery disease withcoronary artery bypass grafting in 1989.SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denied recent orthopnea or PND.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was comfortable and pleasant.Temperature was 97.8. Blood pressure124/68. Heart rate 64. Respiratory rate 18. Oxygen saturation96% on room air. Neck without jugular venous distention.Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1/S2. No murmurs.Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. Extremities no cyanosis ,clubbing or edema. Rectal occult blood negative.Chest x-ray was negative by report. Electrocardiogram with painshowed normal sinus rhythm at 61. Axis was 0. There was nosignificant change compared to a September , 1997 , electrocardiogram. Hislaboratory studies were notable for a CPK of 103. Liver functiontests were within normal limits. Troponin was 0.0. Hematocrit was40.7.HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Medical Short Stay Unitwith chest pain. He underwent a rule outmyocardial infarction protocol with negative serial CPKs. He hadno events on cardiac monitor. He had no further episodes of chestpain while in the hospital. On hospital day number two , heunderwent an exercise test. It was a standard Bruce protocol andhe exercised for 9 minutes 1 second , stopping secondary to legfatigue. He had no chest pain. His peak heart rate was 131. Peakblood pressure was 200/100 with no electrocardiographic changes.His test was read as showing no evidence of ischemia. The patientwas then discharged to home. There were no medication changes.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Same as on admission.Dictated By: FERMIN T. ONISHI , M.D. DK71Attending: RAMIRO S.

He was in his usual state of healthuntil three days prior to admission when he began to develop acough productive occasionally of yellow sputum , dyspnea on exertionand temperatures to 102 degrees. One day prior to admission , hewent to his primary healthcare provider where he was diagnosed withpneumonia and given Erythromycin and Ciprofloxacin withoutimprovement. The following day , he went back to his primary careprovider and was given cough syrup with Codeine , but without reliefand through the course of that day , he developed increasingshortness of breath , chills and diaphoresis and so he presented tothe emergency room. In the emergency room , he had a temperature of100 degrees with room air oxygen saturations between 90% and 95%.He was cultured and a chest x-ray was taken which showed a rightmiddle lobe infiltrate and therefore , he was admitted with acommunity acquired pneumonia resistant to outpatient management.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 100.1 degrees ,blood pressure 130/80 , heart rate 60 , oxygensaturation 99% on three liters nasal cannula. His HEENTexamination was unremarkable. His lung examination revealedrhonchorous breath sounds throughout with decreased breath soundsat his bases , right greater than left. He also had diffuseinspiratory and expiratory wheezes. His cardiac examinationrevealed a regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no murmurs , gallopsor rubs. The abdominal examination was benign. His extremitiesrevealed no edema. His neurological examination was non-focal.LABORATORY: His laboratory studies were notable for a chem-7 thatwas within normal limits. His CBC revealed a whiteblood cell count of 7.3 with a hematocrit of 33.5 and a plateletcount of 130. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 with leftatrial enlargement. There were no ischemic changes. His chestx-ray revealed diffuse infiltrates bilaterally with a more focalarea of consolidation in the right middle lobe.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 65 year-old male with diabetesmellitus , coronary artery disease and sleep apneawho was admitted with a community acquired pneumonia who had failedoutpatient management. He was initially started on intravenousCefuroxime and Azithromycin for likely community acquired bacterialpathogens and atypical organisms. He was cultured and sputums wereobtained , however no organisms were ever isolated throughout hishospital course. On hospital day number two , he developedincreasing shortness of breath with oxygen saturations of roughly86% on six liters. At this time , his lung examination was notablefor marked increase in the inspiratory and expiratory wheezes withdecreased air movements. The rest of his examination at this timeincluding the cardiac examination was unremarkable. This event wasfelt to be bronchospasm due to airway inflammation and he wastreated with numerous Albuterol nebulizers and intravenous Lasix onwhich his oxygenation gradually improved to 96% on six liters.Because of the concern of reactive airway disease and perhapsworsening pneumonia , he was at this time switched to Legionelladoses of Azithromycin and was started on aggressive nebulizertreatments. However , at this time , the possibility of flashpulmonary edema causing cardiac problems was also raised. However ,it was noted at this time that there was no clear precipitant foran episode of flash pulmonary edema and that his blood pressure wasat baseline. His heart rate was at 70 and he had not becomeobviously fluid overloaded. Nonetheless , he received a cardiacwork-up which concluded that he was being ruled out for amyocardial infarction and the following day , he received anechocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 58% withapical inferior and inferoseptal akinesis. There was no markedleft ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore , it was thought unlikelythat flash pulmonary edema had significantly contributed to hishypoxia and he was subsequently treated solely for severe communityacquired pneumonia with a large bronchospastic component. He wastherefore continued on Cefuroxime and Azithromycin with gradualresolution of his fevers and a significant improvement in his airmovement and his pulmonary examination. Two weeks prior to thisadmission , he was started on a Prednisone taper and subsequentunderwent marked improvement in his air movement and in the degreeof bronchospasm. Therefore , he was discharged home on thefollowing medications.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Biaxin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. times twoday to complete a long course foratypical coverage. 2 ) Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.shortness of breath. 3 ) Enteric coated aspirin. 4 ) Glyburide 5mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6 ) Prednisonetaper. 7 ) Timoptic one drop o.u. q.

EKG , sinus rhythm ,left bundle branch block with multiple PVCs , a widened QRS ofduration of 190 milliseconds. Chest x-ray , cardiomegalyconsistent with mild interstitial edema.HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary , this is a 64-year-old male with ahistory of coronary artery disease status post CABG and NSTEMI ,CHF with a known EF of 15% , status post aortic valve replacement ,presenting through an outside hospital with CHF exacerbationlikely secondary to ischemia.1. Cardiovascular:Ischemia: No evidence of ongoing ischemia on admission.Elevated troponin at outside hospital trended down possiblysecondary to NSTEMI prior to admission versus demand. Thepatient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta-blocker and ACEinhibitor , which were titrated to effect. The patient wasstarted on a statin and continued on Niaspan , left heart cathrevealed occluded graft and 2+ aortic insufficiency with 100% LADstenosis , 70% diagonal 1 , 90% circumflex , 45% RCA and 100%effused LIMA graft to circumflex and a 100% effused SVG graft toLAD. The patient is now status post stenting the OM V1 and LAD.The patient has remained asymptomatic and shortness of breath hasimproved.Pump: EF 15% on repeat echo with severe MR. The patient wascontinued on spironolactone. The patient continued to bediuresed initially and is now euvolemic. He will need a repeatecho in three months to evaluate his ejection fraction anddetermine the utility of an AICD placement.Rhythm: We held verapamil secondary to double AV nodal blockade.However , with the patient's history of widened QRS and multiplePVCs and SVT , the patient will follow up with EP to assess theutility of AICD.2. Respiratory: The patient has no acute issues. Shortness ofbreath has improved. Continues to complain of residual shortnessof breath while lying flat on his left side.3. Renal: Creatinine has been stable at baseline. We willclosely follow status post chat. The patient was pretreated withbicarbonate and Mucomyst. Creatinine remained stable.4. GI: LFTs are mildly increased likely secondary to rightheart failure.5. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was 39 on admission. Ittrended down status post cath likely secondary to blood lossgiven the long case and hemodilution; however , hematocrit fell to38 concerning for retroperitoneal bleed. Despite patientremaining hemodynamically stable and groin without evidence ofhematoma , the patient underwent a CT scan , which was negative.His hematocrit was stabilized. He was not transfused , as he wasasymptomatic and recently revascularized. The patient was notedto be guaiac positive without evidence of gross bleeding , thuswill need outpatient follow-up and colonoscopy. The patientcontinues his heparin-bridged Coumadin with a goal of INR 2 to 3.In addition , the patient suffers from long-termthrombocytopenia. His platelet count was 113 on admission.Review of records revealed thrombocytopenia on previous admissionto Norpid Memorial Hospital as well as on presentation to outside hospital priorto heparinization , thus low suspicion for HIT. The patient'splatelet level remained stable. He should consider outpatientevaluation by Hematology.6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes on oralhypoglycemics , which were discontinued on admission. The patientwas controlled with regular insulin and placed back on his oralhypoglycemics prior to discontinuing. A1c was within normallimits.7. ID: No acute issues.8. Psych: History of anxiety , on Paxil and Ativan.9. FEN: The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet.10. Prophylaxis: The patient was encouraged to stop smoking.He was maintained on a nicotine patch during his hospital stay ,which he tolerated well.

He has also had progressive fatigue and somnolence. Hedenies PND , orthopnea , chest pain , recently ( one week ago ). Hehad productive cough and was started on amoxicillin with someinitial improvement in his energy , but has had a continuousdecline since then. He can do his activities of daily living ,but he gets shortness of breath when he is wheeling around in hiswheelchair. He went to his primary care physician , Dr. Emil Hattaway who felt that he was volume overloaded and noticed adesaturation to 81% on room air and admitted him to the HeartFailure Service for diuresis and optimization.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.2. Morbid obesity.3. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline 1.6 to 1.9 ).4. Gynecomastia.5. Peripheral vascular disease.6. Coronary artery disease.7. Diabetes 2.8. Venous stasis ulcer.9. COPD.10. Two-vessel CABG in 1995.11. Echo in 2003 showing EF of 25% to 30%.12. Atrial fibrillation.13. Left leg amputation status post a diabetic ulcer.14. Peptic ulcer disease.15. Distant history of DVT.16. Status post bilateral FEM-POP surgeries.17. Chronic venous stasis ulcers.18. History of bilateral diaphragm paralysis.19. Echocardiogram 4/23/04 showed EF 25% to 30% , akinesis ofthe inferior wall , right ventricular function was moderatelyreduced , trace aortic insufficiency , mild mitral regurgitation ,mild tricuspid regurgitation , PASP of 36 plus right atrialpressure.20. Hemoglobin A1c on 11/29/04 was 5.6.ALLERGIES: Linezolid.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:1. Lasix 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. ( increased from 120 mg b.i.d. on4/13/04 ).2. Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. started on 11/9/04.3. Toprol-XL 12.5 mg p.o. q. day.4. Coumadin as needed for INR of 2 to 3.5. Glipizide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.6. Niferex 150 mg p.o. q. day.7. Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q. day.The following medications have been stopped recently:1. ACE inhibitor ( for hyperkalemia ).2. Zocor.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 96.7 , pulse 95 , blood pressure140/66 , respirations 20 , saturation 83% on room air up to 90% on2 liters. The patient was in no apparent distress at rest , buthad mild shortness of breath with repositioning. His JVP was 13to 14 cm. He had crackles bilaterally , one-third of the way uphis lungs. Heart was regular rate and rhythm , 2/7 left uppersternal border murmur. Abdomen: Obese , nontender , nondistended ,normoactive bowel sounds. He had a left below the kneeamputation , which was warm and clean. Right leg was fullyintact , but there is severe crusting of the skin of the leg fromthe knee down , very swollen right foot with skin intact and nopalpable pulses.LABORATORIES: Sodium 139 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 ,bicarbonate 30 , BUN 71 , creatinine 1.7 , glucose 125. BNP was473 , digoxin 0.8 , albumin 3.7. White blood cell count 6.2 ,hematocrit 39.8 , platelets 122 , 000 , INR 3.0 , PTT 68.9. Chestx-ray showed small bilateral effusions and enlarged cardiacsilhouette. EKG left bundle-branch block with no peaked T waves ,normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversion in I , L , V5 , V6 ( whichrepresent repolarization abnormality because they are asymmetric ,consistent with LVH although it does not meet formal LVHcriteria ).HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular:a. Ischemia: The patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , butgiven his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that wasnegative.b. Pump: The patient was felt to be volume overloaded. Hisadmission weight was 130 kg. He was started on IV Lasix fordiuresis and began to diurese well putting out approximately 2 to3 liters negative per day. He had a right heart catheterizationwhich showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressureof 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggestinghigh left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. Cardiacoutput was 7.83 , cardiac index was 3.09 , SVR was 695 , PVR was174. Therefore , the patient was felt to still be volumeoverloaded and was diuresed further. At the time of thisdictation , his weight has dropped to 118 kg from 130 onadmission.From the perspective of blood pressure , he was started onhydralazine and Isordil to reduce his afterload and these weretitrated up with the goal systolic blood pressure of less than120.c. Rhythm: The patient had atrial fibrillation and he was kepton Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3 except when he was beingprepped for his right heart cath. He is now being restarted onCoumadin following the cath with the goal INR of 2 to 3.2. Pulmonary: The patient seemed to have several possiblecauses for his shortness of breath including volume overload andhis underlying COPD and body habitus. An arterial blood gas wasdone with 2 liters nasal cannula on 10/11/04 and this showed pHof 7.28 , CO2 of 76 , oxygen of 67 , and bicarbonate of 37. This ison 2 liters nasal cannula giving an A-a gradient of 16. Comparedto his prior ABG in January 2003 , which showed pH 7.43 , carbondioxide of 52 , and oxygen of 60 with a bicarbonate of 37. Thissuggested that the patient was hypoventilating. Therefore , hewas started on BiPAP overnight and he said that his sense ofcomfort of breathing improved following BiPAP. At this point , hewill be sent home on home BiPAP.3. Chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateraleffusions , which were confirmed on a chest CT. However , becausethe patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to beimproving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted.4. Dermatological: The patient had severe skin thickening fromhis lymphedema. Dermatology was consulted for proper care of hislegs. They were initially concerned that there could have been asuperimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started onlevofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significantclinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacinwas discontinued after two days. Dermatology made specificrecommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strengthDakin's soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed bybetamethasone cream and Lac-Hydrin cream mixture twice a day.There is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of thepatient's nose for which Dermatology performed a shave biopsy forconcern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cellcarcinoma. This showed endophytic squamous proliferation withatypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. Thiswas potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cellcarcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitivediagnosis. Deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point.5. Urology: The patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urineoutput into his Foley. Initially , this was dark red; however ,this lightened significantly. There are also some clots evident.The Foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on hisown; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although itappears to have lightened up. Further followup will be requiredlikely with Urology as an outpatient.6. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , whichis well controlled after his recent weight loss. He wasmaintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale.7. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondaryto his diabetes mellitus. We avoided contrast dye. Thepatient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresisprocess going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 1/23/04.The discharge medications and instructions will be dictated as anaddendum at the time of discharge.eScription document: 1-2068440 ISSten TelCC: Dong Munsterman M.D.Cragoson Balt CleveandtopeLakefallspines Atlporti ACC: Hilton Duffie M.D.Rell HospitalEttegilb Heightsnash ChunahClellmorn Hwy. , Talake , Massachusetts 13195Dictated By: ARNST , GREGGAttending: CIDRE , QUINCYDictation ID 6983561D: 10/27/04T: 10/27/04

He has a history of severecoronary artery disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.He is status post multiple previous myocardial infarctions andpresents with dyspnea on exertion over the last several months.However , he denies any frank chest pain. The patient's cardiacworkup revealed four vessel coronary artery disease and severemitral regurgitation. He is preoperatively admitted to thecardiology service for surgical planning for coronary artery bypassgrafting.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus;osteomyelitis; anemia; right 5th and leftthird toe amputation; peripheral vascular disease; anemia; chronicrenal insufficiency; status post laminectomy; tobacco and alcoholuse.MEDICATIONS: Insulin , Lasix , Accupril , Digoxin , Isordil , andaspirin.ALLERGIES: To fish , which causes swelling.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: Spanish-speaking male in no acutedistress. NECK: No carotid bruits. LUNGS:Crackles at the bases bilaterally. HEART: II/VI systolic ejectionmurmur at the axilla , with a displaced of PMI. ABDOMEN: Soft ,non-tender. EXTREMITIES: The femoral pulses are palpablebilaterally , however , there were no palpable distal pulses. Therewas no evidence of any significant varicosities. The left shin issignificant for two small eschars with a minimal rim of erythema.His lower extremity is consistent with chronic vascular disease.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for surgical planning.Previous echocardiogram showed an ejectionfraction of 25-30% , a dilated left atrial size , 4+ MR , and moderateTR. There was also severe hypokinesis of the inferior posteriorwall of left ventricle. Cardiac catheterization performed on2/8 showed four vessel disease. Follow-up ABI studies werestable with the right at 0.68 and the left at 1.61. Carotidnoninvasive studies showed no significant carotid disease towarrant surgical evaluation.On 7/23 , the patient was taken to the operating room , wherequadruple coronary artery bypass graft was performed , as well as amitral valve repair with a #26 posterior Cosgrove annuloplastyband. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transportedto the cardiac surgery ICU.Postoperatively , the patient's course was significant for acute andchronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a low ejectionfraction , congestive heart failure , and volume overload. Thepatient was weaned off of epinephrine and diuresed accordingly. Hewas subsequently transferred to the stepdown unit after severaldays in the ICU. He continued to progress well with the additionaldiuresis. His chest tubes and wires were removed withoutdifficulty. Radiographs showed improvement in bilateral pulmonaryedema.On the day of discharge , the patient was stable with stable vitalsigns. He was afebrile , with no significant leukocytosis. Hisrenal function had returned to his baseline of around 2.0.DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ( 1 ) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) captopril25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; ( 3 ) Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.q.d.; ( 4 ) Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d.; ( 5 ) Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.;( 6 ) Coumadin for goal INR of 2-3; ( 7 ) Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 8 )NPH 20 U subcu. q.a.m.; ( 9 ) ibuprofen 600 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.pain.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.Dictated By: MYLES TIEDEMANN , M.D. XG70Attending: KIRBY A.

HYPERTENSION.2. LEFT FRONTAL LOBE MENINGIOMA.3. DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Testani is a 90+ year-old woman witha history of hypertension , prioratrial fibrillation , who presented to the Ie Health on2/14/01 with shortness of breath and some chest pain lastingseveral hours at home. She was brought in by her greatgranddaughter and found to have ST segment elevations inferiorly onan electrocardiogram concerning for inferior myocardial infarction.At that point she was transferred to Hobert Centerfor emergent catheterization. In the emergency room she wastreated with Lasix , Lopressor , morphine , nitropaste , aspirin andheparin and then sent for cardiac catheterization. Cardiaccatheterization showed a right dominant system with no left maindisease , mid left anterior descending coronary artery 80 percentlesion , a proximal left circumflex left anterior descendingcoronary artery lesion and a proximal 100 percent posteriordescending coronary artery stenosis. The posterior descendingcoronary artery was intervened upon and stented to a residualstenosis of 0 percent. The patient tolerated the procedure wellwithout any complications and was then transferred to the intensivecare unit for further monitoring. On admission to the coronarycare unit the patient had no complaints , including no shortness ofbreath , and no chest pain. She was noted to have a right groinhematoma for which pressure was held.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , atrial fibrillation , historyof pulmonary edema , left frontal lobemeningioma as documented by MRI of the brain in February of 2000.MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix dose unknown , atenolol 50 mg p.o.q day , Zestril 10 mg per day , Isordil 10mg t.i.d. and meclizine p.r.n.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98 , heart rate 75 , blood pressure140/70 , respiratory rate 16 , 94 percent on 2 litersof oxygen. GENERAL: Awake , alert and oriented in no acutedistress. Oropharynx is clear. Crackles present bilaterallythroughout both lung fields. CARDIAC: Regular , rate and rhythm.Normal S1 and S2. II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternalborder. No radiation to the neck. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender andnondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No edema. 2plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Neurologicstatus intact. Nonfocal exam.LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: White blood cell count 13.6 ,hematocrit 39 , platelets 222 , 000.Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 100 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 37 ,creatinine 2.0 , glucose 192. PT was 11 , PTT 23 , INR 0.88. CKnumber one is 216 with no MB fraction done prior to transfer. CKnumber two post cardiac catheterization 2577 , MB 310 , troponin3.49.Electrocardiogram prior to transfer showed normal sinus rhythm atthe time pre-catheterization. Rate of 75. Two millimeter STsegment elevation in leads II , III and F.HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: The patient was transferredto the coronary care unit after cardiaccatheterization and right coronary artery stent for furthermanagement. She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. Her peak CKwas 2577 with a MB fraction of 310. Troponin on admission was3.49. She was placed on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , Zestril andsimvastatin. Two days after this initial catheterization on10/10/01 , the patient was transferred to the floor and subsequentlyhad an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was thought to be todiastolic dysfunction. This occurred in the context of her havinga systolic blood pressure of 200. She was then transferred back tothe coronary care unit where she had intermittent complaints ofchest pain. Electrocardiogram showed pseudo normalization of the Twaves laterally. Her CKs continued to trend down however due tothe concern of further ischemia she was placed on heparin andbrought back to the catheterization laboratory on 6/27/01 forstenting of the left circumflex lesion. Since the second stent shecontinued to do well from a cardiovascular standpoint. Her CKscontinued to trend down. An echocardiogram was done which showedan ejection fraction of 45 percent , inferior posterior akinesis ,moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.She was managed with aspirin , Plavix with plans to keep her on thisfor one month , Zocor and Lopressor. Due to a rising creatinineafter the second catheterization her Zestril has been stopped andshe has been started on hydralazine until her creatininenormalizes.2. Renal: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 whichincreased to 4.0 after her second catheterization. The etiology isdeemed to be contrast induced nephropathy. Her creatinine is nowimproving down to 3.2 at the time of discharge. This should befollowed and her Zestril restarted at 10 mg per day and thehydralazine stopped when the creatinine normalizes to below 2.0.Electrolytes were stable throughout the admission.3. Pulmonary: No active issues currently. She did have anepisode of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high bloodpressure found to be due to diastolic dysfunction. The goal is tocontrol the patient's blood pressure to avoid these episodes.There is no need for diuresis.4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with a hematocritof 39 but did drop to 27 slowly during the course of the admission.She did have guaiac positive stools while on heparin. She wastransfused a total of two units to keep her hematocrit above 30 andfor the five days prior to discharge , her hematocrit was stable at34. The patient consumes a low fat low cholesterol diet and is onPrilosec 20 mg q day.5. Psychiatry/neurologic: The patient was noted to sun down atnight with episodes of confusion and agitation. A psychiatryconsult was obtained and felt that the patient's behavior wasconsistent with dementia and recommended starting Zyprexa. Thepatient was placed on standing Zyprexa 5 mg at night and continuedto improve on this medication. She had no episodes of agitationafter being transferred to the floor. In addition she has ahistory of left frontal lobe mass which is consistent with ameningioma. This has been noted on CT and MRI scans done in Februaryof 2000. Neurosurgery consult was obtained and felt that surgerywould not be a good option for this patient , in addition they didnot feel that the mass was responsible for any mental statuschanges.6. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of a positiveRPR which has not been treated previously. She is now beingtreated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million unitstimes three injections. She has one injection pending which is dueon 3/5/01. In addition she has had a negative lumbar puncturefor neurologic syphilis.DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is to be discharged to theChora Medical Center witheventual plans to return to home.She will also follow up with a new primary care provider , Dr. Ernesto Fouch at the Crestsant Health on 2/2/01.MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n.pain , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day , Colace100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Robitussin 15 cc p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n. cough ,hydralazine 20 mg p.o. q.i.d.

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASESECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. HYPETENSION3. DYSPEPSIA4. ADJUSTMENT DISORDER WITH ANXIETYID/CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient is a 70 year old white femalestatus post non Q wave MI in 18 of October , withthrombolytic therapy and cardiac risk factors of long standinghypertension , hypercholesterolemia , and history of tobacco use , whopresents upon transfer from Ra Memorial Hospital with chiefcomplaint of post MI unstable angina.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient has the history oflong standing hypertension and has hadchest pain in the past including at least one previous episode ofrule out MI. She was admitted on 26 of March , to Hen Mo Gardensworth Sent Hospital withsigns and symptoms consistent with acute MI , and apparentlyreceived salvage therapy with IV Streptokinase and TPA. Limitedrecords are available from this hospitalization. The patientapparently had a submax exercise tolerance test before dischargewhich is reportedly unremarkable. Upon discharge from Woodgi Hospital the patient additionally did well and then had threeepisodes of typical substernal chest pain with minimal exertionthat were relieved with SL Nitroglycerin.On 10 of August , the patient presented to Cooker View Home Hospital with anepisode of heavy substernal chest pressure that was similar inquality to her previous MI. This pain was not relieved with SLNitroglycerin. There was no associated shortness of breath ,nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis. In the Ist Medical Center ER , she wastreated with SL and topical nitrates with subsequent relief of herchest pain. Her presentation was also significant for a chestx-ray consistent with interstitial edema. Otherwise , herexamination was unremarkable and her EKG showed no worrisomeischemic changes. She ruled out for MI and on 21 of August , wastransferred to CNMC on IV Heparin , IV Nitroglycerin , beta blockadeand aspirin. At the time of her admission , the patient was withoutchest pain and denied other associated symptoms.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in18 of October , as above; long standing hypertension ,75 pack year history of cigarette smoking , hypercholesterolemia ,chronic dyspepsia , history of positive PPD with normal chest x-ray ,remote history of breast cancer.

CVexam showed a regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds ,normal S1 and S2 , question of S4 , no appreciable murmurs. Theabdomen was obese , soft with normoactive bowel sounds. There wereprevious surgical scars. No masses or hepatosplenomegaly wasnoted. There were normal femoral and distal pulses , no peripheraledema , no peripheral bruits. Neuro exam was unremarkable.LABORATORY DATA: The admission labs showed hematocrit 34.2 , WBC6.7 , platelets 159 , 000 , PTT 50.0 on IV Heparin.Urinalysis was essentially within normal limits. Glucose was 110 ,BUN 12 , creatinine 1.0 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 106 andbicarb 29. LFT's were all within normal limits. Admission CK was32 , albumin 3.9 , magnesium 2.0 , uric acid 6.2 , cholesterol 186. Thechest x-ray was unavailable. EKG showed sinus bradycardia at arate of 50 , first degree AV block axis +60 , ST elevation in leadsV2-V4 , poor R wave progression leads V1-V3.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient did well over the first 24 hours ofadmission. On 29 of November , the patient went to cardiaccath. Angiogram showed 50% mid circumflex , 60% mid left anteriordescending and only luminal irregularities in the right RCA ,anterior wall hypokinesis but overall good LV systolic functionwith an EF of approximately 72%. Average pulmonary capillary wedgepressure was 20 and right atrial pressure 9. Cardiac output was4.5 with cardiac index of 2.5. Careful review of the cath filmsshowed no hemodynamically significant lesions felt to beresponsible for the patient's chest pain. Echo performed on12 of August , showed left ventricular hypertrophy with low normal LVsystolic function , estimated EF of 50-55% , inferior posteriorhypokinesis , and trace of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation. Therewas mild right ventricular hypertrophy and normal estimatedpulmonary artery pressure.Postcatheterization , the patient showed mild hypertension which wastreated by the addition of a calcium channel blocker , and she wasalso diuresed for fluid overload. Prior to discharge , she had twoadditional episodes of chest pain that were low in intensity butprolonged. Each of these required several Nitroglycerins andantacids to be relieved. It was felt that the chest pain wasunlikely to be cardiac in origin and more likely represented eitherGI symptomatology or an anxiety reaction. The patient repeatedlyexpressed great concern over her husband's illness and understoodthe possible connection between this and her chest pain. On 7 of August ,the patient underwent exercise treadmill test on the modified Bruceprotocol. She went 10 minutes and 30 seconds stopping secondary tofatigue. Maximum heart rate was 108 , maximum BP 164 systolic , nosymptoms and no EKG changes , and the test was interpreted asshowing no evidence for ischemia. The patient was discharged tohome and is to follow up at AMC .COMPLICATIONS: None.

He has had anginal type chest pain for years , neverassociated with numbness , nausea , or sweating. Usually , they wereabout four times a week but three months ago , he began getting painfour to five times a day not with any exertion. He has haddecreased exercise tolerance. He takes one to four Nitroglycerintablets a day. The day of admission , he felt light headed and hadsubsequent substernal chest pain. He took two Nitroglycerin withno relief and called an ambulance where he had Morphine andNitroglycerin with relief. This pain was non-radiating but wasassociated with nausea and urge to defecate. He was not quite sureit was same as his inferior myocardial infarction which he had in1973. In 1980 , he had a coronary artery bypass graft and again in1982. Catheterization in 1987 revealed that the grafts were patentwith the native vessels occluded. In 7/25 , he had an echo withoverall contraction normal , there was inferior and posteriorhypokinesis , mild anteroseptal , and diastolic dimension was judgedto be possibly global. In 1993 , he had an exercise tolerance testconsistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. He went sixminutes and seven seconds with a pulse of 70 and a blood pressureof 150/70 with typical chest pain. He had a thallium at the sametime and that showed mild non-transmural defect inferiorly with noischemia. Also on 9/2/93 , he presented with a cough and had anabnormal chest X-Ray. He was treated with antibiotics. He deniesany recent cough , fever , chills , or sources for infection.

He had 190 platelets ,hematocrit of 41 , and a white count of 5.4.HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was assessed as having possible chestpain and was put on a rule out myocardialinfarction protocol. The pain was said to be atypical but it wasconsidered best to rule him out. He was also started onCeftriaxone for a possible pneumonia. He had blood cultures timestwo taken which subsequently came back normal and a PA and lateralchest X-Ray , he did not have infiltrates so that was discontinued.He went on to rule out for a myocardial infarction and he underwentexercise thallium on which , on a modified Bruce protocol , he wenteight minutes with a heart rate of 93 , blood pressure 150/70 withno ischemia but chest pain without episode of mild or reversibledefect , and an anterior transmural reversible defect. Patient wastold of his condition and was started on a beta blocker perCardiology. In the hospital , patient developed some episodes ofchest pain with EKG normal each time. His stomach had also feltascitic lately. Cardiology saw him and did not feel that the painwas cardiac with a myocardial infarction. He was placed on p.o.Pepcid for ascitic stomach.

In 1983 , the patient was admitted to Nocksu Hospitalwhere she ruled in for a non Q wave myocardial infarction with peakCK of 182 , 7% MB. EKG showed global T wave inversions. Thepatient was transferred to Tampnew Hospital where acardiac catheterization was performed which showed an 80% proximalLAD lesion and a 30% mid RCA lesion. The patient was thentransferred to Rocke Elel Word Hospital for PTCA. The angioplastyprocedure was not done. The patient was managed medically and didwell for the next seven years from a cardiac standpoint. She hadonly minimal anginal symptoms and shortness of breath during thatperiod. In April of 1988 , the patient had an echocardiogramwhich showed significant LVH , decreased LV compliance , borderlineleft atrial enlargement and no regional wall motion abnormalities.In October of 1991 , the patient had an ETT in which she exercised forfour minutes , 28 seconds achieving a peak heart rate of 103 and apeak blood pressure of 150/60 , stopping secondary to fatigue andshortness of breath without chest pain or EKG changes. Also inOctober of 1991 , the patient had pulmonary function tests whichshowed normal spirometry and lung volumes. On 7/28/91 , the patientwas having progressive shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertionthat morning. She presented to Li General Hospital with worseningdyspnea , wheezing. Her respiratory rate was 30 , and O2 saturationwas 85%. The patient was treated for presumed asthma withBronkosol nebulizers and Solu-Medrol. During the second Bronkosoltreatment , the patient developed 2/10 substernal chest pressureradiating to the left arm which was relieved completely with onesublingual nitroglycerin. There were no EKG changes. The patientwas transferred to West Hospital where she underwenta V-Q scan , the results of which showed low probability ofpulmonary embolus. O2 saturation was 95%. The patient was senthome on Ventolin inhaler. The patient stayed at home for the nextthree weeks , symptom-free. On 7/14 , the patient while walking atthe Jose Xingsterka Sno became acutely short of breath with 2/10substernal chest pressure radiating to the right arm withoutnausea , vomiting or diaphoresis or lightheadedness.

Lungs revealed trace inspiratory crackles at bothbases. There were no wheezes heard. Cardiac exam revealed PMInonpalpable , regular rate and rhythm. There was a I/VI midsystolicmurmur heard at the left sternal border , no gallops. JVP was notappreciated. Carotids were 2+ bilaterally without bruits. Abdomenwas obese , well healed old surgical scars , soft , nontender , nohepatosplenomegaly. Extremities showed trace pedal edema andsymmetrical pedal pulses. Neurological exam was nonfocal. Rectalexam was normal.LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a sodium of 137 , potassium4.5. Chloride was 103. CO2 19. BUN 18.Creatinine 1.2. Glucose 205 which normalized to 93 the next day.Hematocrit was 36. White blood cell count was 14.2. Plateletcount 328 , 000. Urinalysis showed trace red blood cells and somebacteria. EKG while pain free , showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 ,axis of 40 degrees , intervals 0.21/0.10/0.36 and flat T waves in Iand L. Chest x-ray showed a question infiltrate in the left baseconsistent with atelectasis.HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Tu Hospital EmergencyRoom where she was tachypneic and wheezing with apO2 of 86%. EKG showed only T wave flattening in I and L. Thepatient was admitted for presumed asthma and bronchitis and treatedwith Bronkosol nebulizers. In the setting of the Bronkosol , thepatient had substernal chest pressure radiating to the left arm.EKG showed 1 mm of ST depression in I and L and 1 mm ST elevationin lead III. The pain resolved with three sublingualnitroglycerin. The pain recurred a few minutes later and was againresolved with Nitropaste and IV Lopressor. The patient ruled outfor myocardial infarction with CPK's of 43 , 36 , 37. The patientwas then transferred to the Medical Service and was managed withdiltiazem , Lopressor , Isordil and aspirin. On hospital day numbertwo , the patient went for echocardiogram which was not obtainedbecause the patient had developed 5/10 substernal chest pressurewhich resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. There were noEKG changes , the patient was started on heparin with question ofunstable angina at that time. On hospital day number three , thepatient went for cardiac catheterization which showed serial 40 and50% lesions in the LAD and also an 80% lesion in the distal RCA.There were no complications post catheterization. It wasquestionable whether these lesions were serious enough to accountfor the patient's symptoms. The patient's medical regimen wasadvanced and she has tolerated that well and has been symptom freefor the past 48 hours. She was discharged home in stablecondition. She will follow-up with Dr. Gagne in one week.

The patient's fatigue wasmost likely related to dehydration secondary to persistent C.diff related diarrhea. Over the course of her hospitalization ,it became clear that she experienced chest pain during herintermittent episodes of ventricular ectopy. Now that her NSVTis under better control , she is chest pain-free.HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Cardiovascular:Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin , beta-blocker ,statin and gemfibrozil. She had negative cardiac enzymes x3 andruled out by biomarkers.Pump: The patient was initially dry on exam. She was rehydratedwith normal saline. The patient developed shortness of breath onhospital day #4 , most likely secondary to overhydration. She wasgently diuresed with IV Lasix. Electrolytes were repleted twicedaily.

The patient is on Coumadin nowwith therapeutic INR on discharge at 2.6. Per cardiology , herbeta-blocker was increased to 75 q.i.d. and then she wastransitioned to Toprol 300 daily; however , she had persistentnocturnal NSVT , which caused her some chest pain and was quitefrightening to her. Per cardiology , she was loaded on amiodarone400 t.i.d. , which will be continued for 5 days post-discharge andthen the patient will be transitioned to 400 amiodarone daily.At the same time , her Toprol will be decreased to 100 mg daily ,her discharge dose. Echocardiogram was ordered on the day ofdischarge per cardiology. See LMR for formal report.2. Infectious Disease: The patient with recent UTI and C. diffcolitis in the setting of recent hospitalization antibiotic usepresented with diarrhea and elevated white count and fever.Continued on Flagyl p.o. and vancomycin p.o. for Flagyl failure.She had one C. diff positive stool. Stool became C. diffnegative as of 9/2/06. Her diarrhea rapidly slowed on dualtherapy. She will be discharged with seven more days ofantibiotics to complete.3. Endocrine: The patient on home dose Synthroid. TSHinitially low , however , rechecked and found to be within normallimits. Continue home dose of Synthroid.4. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was stable throughout herhospitalization. Continue Niferex at home dose , continueCoumadin at 2.5 mg nightly.5. Pulmonary: The patient had a low pretest probability for PE.Given her allergy to IV contrast , she was not a candidate forPECT; however , a V/Q scan was obtained on 1/19/06.

Her lungs had scattered wheezingbilaterally with good air movement. Heart with normal S1 , S2 andtachycardic. Abdomen is obese , soft , nondistended , nontender.Extremities had 1+ bilateral pitting edema and mild erythema ofher bilateral shins.PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:White blood cell count was 10.6 and hematocrit 30. Chest x-rayshowed a large cardiac silhouette with no evidence of effusion orinfiltrate. The patient had a PE protocol CT which was asuboptimal study due to poor body habitus but it was negative forPE , it did show bilateral ground glass opacities and evidence ofair trapping. It also showed moderate hepatomegaly.PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:The patient had a PECT and she also had pulmonary function testsperformed.HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:This is a 38-year-old female with asthma , diabetes , anemia , andmorbid obesity who was admitted with his asthma exacerbation inthe setting of running out of her medications at home.1. Pulmonary: The patient was started on prednisone 60 mg p.o.daily and remained on it for approximately seven days. It wasdifficult to taper her prednisone due to oxygen desaturationswith ambulation. The patient's oxygen desaturated to 74-84% withambulation. The patient , however , was tapered and is currentlyon 50 mg daily , of prednisone and will be sent out on a seven-daytaper. She was also continued on her Advair and Singulair. Asmentioned above , she had a PE protocol CT that showed no PE.However , it was a suboptimal study due to patient's body habitus.It did show ground glass opacities. Because the patient haddesaturations with ambulation , it was concerned that the patientpossibly had an atypical pneumonia given these ground glassopacities. She was started on levofloxacin and should complete afive-day course. The patient was also tested for HIV which wasnegative. She had a BNP to rule out any evidence of volumeoverload that was contributing to her oxygen desaturations. BNPwas 5. The patient also had hepatitis serologies due tohepatomegaly seen on PECT and these were negative as well.Influenza swabs were negative. The patient was seen in consultby the pulmonary team and they felt that the patient requireedhome oxygen especially at night and with ambulation. Thepatient's O2 saturation while sleeping was 84%. It is highlysuspected that the patient has a component of sleep apnea and sheis to be set up for an outpatient sleep study. Pulmonary alsorecommended obtaining a pulmonary function test. These were doneand it showed an FVC of 51% and an FEV1 of 49% and an FEV-FVCratio of 97% as well as a total lung capacity of 53% and a DLCOof 82%. Pulmonary function tests were consistent withrestrictive disease and this is likely due to patient's obesity.The patient most likely has obesity hypoventilation.
